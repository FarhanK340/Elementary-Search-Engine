        "content": "If you \u2019 ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately , you may have found long lines , empty shelves , and a frustrating lack of availability in general .\nThis is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country , now about 95 % of cases in the US .\nPresident Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation .\nWhile increased test availability is a good thing , those government-supplied , at-home COVID tests may not be available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be distributed .\nAnd if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests , a lot of questions remain .\nHow reliable are they ?\nWhen should you use them ?\nDo they perform differently with Omicron ?\nHere are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests .\nWhen should you use rapid COVID tests ?\nRapid COVID tests are , well , rapidly becoming a way of life in the US .\nAfter being absent in the US for much of the pandemic , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out \u2014 in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online .\nThe pro is that they give fast results \u2014 in about 15 minutes , allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result .\nThe con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests , like a PCR , that can take a day or more to get results .\n\u201c Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina , a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed , a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing .\n\u201c The government is in a position now where it \u2019 s bringing these tests forward , and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used , \u201d he said Tuesday at a press briefing .\nYou can take a COVID test for any reason at all , but here are the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you have been vaccinated .\n\u2022 If you have COVID symptoms , including cough , shortness of breath , fever , and other respiratory virus symptoms \u2022 Have been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes .\n( If you are unvaccinated , get tested right away ; if you are fully vaccinated , get tested within five to seven days after exposure , according to the CDC . )\n\u2022 If you took part in high-risk activities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially distance as recommended , such as when traveling , in crowded indoor places , or attending large gatherings or mass events Many people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work , school , or before or after travel or events .\nAlthough vaccines , especially when combined with a booster , are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant , \u201c we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated , \u201d CDC chief Rochelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday .\n\u201c These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.\n\u201d Regardless of vaccination status , you should wear a mask in public indoor settings .\nWalensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors \u201c to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.\n\u201d How many different at-home COVID tests are there ?\nThere are now ( at least ) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests , which are the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , and generally cost about $ 20 to $ 35 for two \u2014 if you can find them .\nAn antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus , which can be picked up with a nasal swab .\nKeep in mind that no test is perfect .\nAny given medical test is measured by its sensitivity , or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives , and specificity , how good it is at ruling out people who aren \u2019 t sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA \u2019 s emergency-use authorization : There are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test , but they cost more , Mina said .\nThey include Detect , Cue Health , and Lucira , which can be done at home , as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor \u2019 s offices .\n\u201c Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also fewer of them available .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test , \u201d he said .\nIn general , yes .\nBut you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests , like PCR .\nAnd it \u2019 s important to note , a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet peer reviewed , included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York , Los Angeles , and San Francisco in December 2021 .\nThe people were fully vaccinated , many with boosters .\nThe research team , led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson , compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results .\nThey found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test .\nWhile it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests didn \u2019 t always detect a high viral load , the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests , Adamson told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile , \u201d she said .\n\u201c So I think it will move quickly.\n\u201d False positives are much less common .\nHowever , the chances of a false positive can vary by brand , ranging from one in 150 tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat said , if your rapid test gives a positive result , you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test , like PCR .\nRapid tests are about 30 % to 40 % less sensitive than PCR tests , and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms .\nIn one study , a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35 % in asymptomatic people and 64 % in people with symptoms when compared with PCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to people who tested positive for COVID , whether or not they had symptoms .\nIn the study , there were only a handful of false positives , all in asymptomatic people \u2014 but 47 % were false negatives compared with PCR .\nThese are still good tests !\nIt \u2019 s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more ( often many more ) to get a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy .\n\u201c The test is very good when it \u2019 s positive , but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result , \u201d said Dr. Stanley Weiss , a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey .\nIf you get a negative result , follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to believe that you were exposed or infected .\nWait at least 24 hours for your next test , according to the CDC , but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative .\nMina recommends that if you start having symptoms , assume you have Omicron and self-isolate .\nTake your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later .\nWhen interpreting and making decisions based on a test result , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account a person \u2019 s history of vaccination , mask use , exposures to others , and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive , Weiss said .\nYes , that seems to be the case , although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant .\nIt makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few PCR-based tests that don \u2019 t and have recommended that labs don \u2019 t use them .\nIf you do have COVID symptoms , can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic ?\nYes , according to Mina .\nThat \u2019 s because early in the pandemic , humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms \u2014 which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus \u2014 started later in the timeline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have either had COVID , been vaccinated , or in some cases both , symptoms generally start sooner .\n( And it \u2019 s clear that you can get COVID two or more times . )\n\u201c You 're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early , \u201d Mina said .\nHe also noted that \u2019 s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose .\n\u201c That \u2019 s your immunity working , \u201d he said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as an antigen test ?\nNot exactly .\nA lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears \u2014 a positive control to show the test is working \u2014 and another line appears if the test is positive .\nWhile all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests , not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests .\nFor example , pregnancy tests also work in this way but use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing .\nCan a rapid test protect you from getting sick ?\nNot really .\nRapid tests are more about protecting other people , not making sure you don \u2019 t get the virus .\n( That \u2019 s what vaccines , masks , and social distancing are all about . )\nHowever , when people get tested before going to work , a party , school , or traveling , it helps protect everyone .\n( Although it also helps you get treatment sooner , which is important because almost all effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the sooner they are started . )\nRapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus , Mina said .\n\u201c For somebody who \u2019 s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people , then the tests are more likely 95 % or 98 % sensitive for those individuals , \u201d he said .",

        "content": "On the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection , President Joe Biden gave a speech condemning former president Donald Trump for his role in inciting violence and undermining democracy , a striking departure for the president who has spent his first year in office avoiding dwelling on his predecessor .\nBiden \u2019 s speech , delivered on Capitol Hill , carefully avoided naming the former president but focused on keeping the record straight on the violent pro-Trump insurrection and the threat to American democracy that Republicans have stoked in past years .\nYet it was clear who he was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c former president \u201d and the lies he told before , during , and since the 2020 presidential election to try to undermine the results .\nIt was Biden \u2019 s clearest and most prolonged denunciation of Trump from the executive office .\n\u201c His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution .\nHe can not accept that he lost , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c For the first time in our history , a president not just lost an election , he tried to prevent a peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the Capitol.\n\u201d His decision to focus on the former president comes as Democrats weigh whether anti-Trump messaging could sink them in the midterms and as they try to outline what their party stands for instead of only what they stand against .\nUltimately , Biden \u2019 s ( accurate ) portrayal of Trump was an apparent shift to address the ongoing threats to democracy , including restrictive voting laws that ultimately undermine elections across the board .\nBiden \u2019 s tiptoe around actually naming Trump was obvious .\nThe president himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president , '' he told reporters on Capitol Hill when asked why he did n't say Trump 's name .\n`` It 's way beyond that.\n\u201d In a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack , Trump called Biden \u2019 s speech \u201c political theater \u201d and a \u201c distraction.\n\u201d '' It looks like he saw the speech .\nI guess that 's good news .\nMaybe he learned something about what it looks like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in response to Trump \u2019 s statement during the press briefing Thursday .\nPsaki did not immediately respond to an inquiry by BuzzFeed News about some of the thinking around the speech , including whether Biden might talk about Trump more as the midterms approach .\n`` Biden 's right .\nThis is a crisis in democracy , \u201d said Karthik Ganapathy , a progressive consultant with Left Flank Strategies .\n\u201c Coming up with an actual plan to solve it , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left before the midterm elections , I think that 's like a really crucial thing that a lot of people , especially progressives , feel a lot of urgency about . ''\nHe added that Biden \u2019 s most direct attempt to hold Trump accountable came as \u201c a welcome development.\n\u201d Perhaps no instance best encapsulates how striking it is for Biden to focus a speech so heavily on Trump than a comment he made last month \u2014 \u201c I don \u2019 t think about the former president \u201d \u2014 when asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for COVID before a September 2020 debate .\nBiden has previously addressed Trump on certain matters .\nIn December , he pointed out that Trump had taken a COVID-19 booster shot \u2014 `` one of the few things he and I agree on '' \u2014 before going on to condemn `` companies and personalities '' peddling lies about the pandemic .\nHe obviously also struck a direct contrast on the campaign trail not only in his own election but in other contests since .\n`` You ca n't tell the story of Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Addisu Demise , an Oakland-based Democratic strategist .\n\u201c [ Trump ] invited people to Washington , incited them to violence , I would say , and in my mind it would be a denial of history to erase him from the day.\n\u201d Demise said he does n't expect Biden 's focus on Trump to carry into the coming weeks and months as Democrats prepare for the midterms and the next presidential election , because it would distract from talking about his own agenda and achievements .\nBut rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been `` malpractice '' not to talk about Trump 's role in the attempted insurrection on its anniversary .\nLooking at the bigger picture , though , Demise said it would n't make sense for Biden to rag on Trump , who , despite his ongoing political pull , should not be the focus of this presidency .\n`` He was elected in large part to turn the page on the Trump era .\nAnd if he continues to focus on that , it takes him away from his job , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tomorrow , '' Demise said .\nDemocrats have spent a lot of time working to keep the record straight on the events of Jan. 6 against efforts by Republicans to rewrite history , and Biden \u2019 s speech was true to that .\nFrom the start , Democrats built a detailed case illustrating Trump \u2019 s role in inciting the violence , including during the impeachment trial last year \u2014 which he was acquitted of by Republicans .\nTheir efforts continue today : One of the commemorative events Democrats are hosting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderated discussion featuring the Democratic leaders of each chamber of Congress and renowned historians .\n`` I think using this anniversary to stand up for our country , our ideals , and what we believe in as a nation is critical , \u201d said Scott Mulhauser , a Democratic strategist and former Biden adviser .\n\u201c The scars of that day still have n't healed for so many , and part of the way we recover as a country is to ensure that our democracy stands .

        "content": "Rep. Liz Cheney and her father , former vice president Dick Cheney , after attending a moment of silence to mark the first anniversary of the Capitol attack , on Capitol Hill , Jan. 6 .\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats lined up to greet former vice president Dick Cheney in the House chamber Thursday , a rare moment of outreach to a onetime party villain who is now one of the few high-profile Republicans to fully acknowledge what happened before and during last year 's fatal Capitol riots .\nHis daughter Rep. Liz Cheney is under attack by her own party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former president Donald Trump \u2019 s false claims of election fraud .\nHouse Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro was one of several Democrats to pay their respect to the former vice president during a short procedural session in Congress marking the anniversary of the Capitol attack .\n\u201c I believe he cares deeply about this country , \u201d DeLauro told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c We have different views on issues .\nI think that 's important that he 's here .\nI think it speaks to the strength of the institution and the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't about partisanship , \u201d she said .\n\u201c This is about , you know , what this citadel of democracy represents , for him , for me , for Liz Cheney , for all of us here.\n\u201d Reps. Lizzie Fletcher , David Cicilline , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , and Eric Swalwell also spoke to Dick Cheney .\n\u201c In this fight , he \u2019 s an ally , \u201d Swalwell said later .\n\u201c And this fight , for the soul of America , is the only one that matters.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress , cabinet secretary , and White House official has not exactly been beloved by Democrats over the last half-century .\nThroughout the presidency of George W. Bush , Cheney was portrayed by Democrats in and out of Congress as the dark force driving the president and the functional Republican power center , from the Iraq War to any number of domestic political fights .\nBut Cheney , and his now out-of-style brand of neoconservatism , is not aligned with where the party is today .\nThe current Republican Party leadership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years.\n\u201d The House of Representatives did not have scheduled votes Thursday , and many members have stayed out of DC this week .\nSome House Democrats served food to US Capitol Police officers and campus staff to thank them for their actions one year ago .\nBut Republicans in particular were not eager to be at the Capitol for the first anniversary of the insurrection , where they inevitably would have had to face renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conspiracies Trump hawked that inspired hundreds to riot .\nReps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz are scheduled to hold a public response to the anniversary , after Trump canceled a press conference with the same agenda .\nLike other House Republicans , Greene and Gaetz skipped the ceremonial events Democrats held .\nThey instead appeared on Steve Bannon \u2019 s War Room .\n\u201c We \u2019 re ashamed of nothing .\nWe \u2019 re proud of the work we did on Jan. 6 and we \u2019 re actually going to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House to the Capitol , \u201d Gaetz said on the program .\nThe two promised to make the same \u201c legitimate arguments about election integrity \u201d at Thursday \u2019 s press conference .\nCheney was not the only Democratic villain of the early 2000s to make an unusual reappearance for the insurrection anniversary .\nKarl Rove , for years Bush \u2019 s top political adviser , wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed condemning the riot \u201c apologists \u201d in the Republican Party for not being honest about what happened on Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what some Trump supporters did on that violent Jan. 6 , Republicans would have criticized them mercilessly and been right to do so , \u201d he wrote .\nRepublicans , instead , have been most merciless with Liz Cheney , one of two Republicans on the committee investigating the insurrection and a prime political target of Trump \u2019 s in this year \u2019 s elections .\nCheney was removed from a Republican leadership position last year after voting for Trump \u2019 s impeachment .\n\u201c My daughter can take care of herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .",

        "content": "President Joe Biden speaks at the US Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2022 , to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Capitol .\nOne year after former president Donald Trump 's supporters tried to overturn an election , President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a dire warning at the scene of the attack : The threat to democracy and the potential for political violence continues , driven by new , Republican-led voter restrictions across the country .\n\u201c Those who stormed this Capitol , and those who instigated and incited , and those who called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t come here out of patriotism or principle .\nThey came here in rage . ''\nHe asked : `` Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm ? ''\nBoth Biden and Harris emphasized how , in the aftermath of the attempted insurrection , the fragility of American democracy and the need to actively defend it has been clear , evoking hard-won battles for the vote by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not defend it , \u201d Harris said , \u201c Democracy simply will not stand . ''\nOne year on , there are hundreds of criminal cases stemming from the riot winding their way through the court system .\nFar-right extremism continues to adapt and worm its way into the mainstream .\nAnd Republicans continue to push conspiracy theories around the election and stall voting rights reforms in the Senate .\n\u201c New laws are being written not to protect the vote but to deny it , \u201d Biden said .\n`` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subvert it .\nNot to strengthen and protect our democracy .\nBecause the former president lost , instead of looking at election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes , the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections .\nIt \u2019 s wrong .\nIt \u2019 s undemocratic.\n\u201d He continued : \u201c Let 's speak plainly about what happened in 2020 .\nEven before the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results . ''\nBiden and Harris made the case that the Jan. 6 attack was not only a physical threat to democracy but that the election denial ideology behind the attack also spurred a series of voter restriction bills from Republican legislators across the country .\nIn the past year , 19 states have passed laws that restrict voter access , on the same basis that drove hundreds , including groups of white supremacists , to storm the Capitol grounds , assault and demean police officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallows hung on the Capitol lawn : the false narrative , pushed by Trump , that Biden stole the election .\nBiden called Trump out in his address on Thursday morning , pointing to his actions spurring on the attackers on Jan. 6 and his continued attempts to spread misinformation and inflame election denial conspiracy theories .\n\u201c For the first time in our history , a president not just lost an election .\nHe tried to prevent a peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden said .\n\u201c His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution , \u201d he said .\n`` He can not accept that he lost . ''\nHarris compared the need to defend democracy from extremists today to the blood spilled in the battle for civil rights in decades past .\n\u201c What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building , \u201d she said .\n\u201c What they were assaulting were the institutions , the values , the ideals that generations of Americans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish and defend.\n\u201d \u201c On Jan. 6 , we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful , \u201d Harris said .\n\u201c The 'big lie ' did n't just drive the insurrection , \u201d said Michael Waldman , president of the Brennan Center for Justice .\n`` It has driven a wave of anti-voter laws across the country , laws to restrict voting and pull cut back on voting rights and laws to change who does the counting \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Waldman said Biden has been \u201c more muted than would have been ideal \u201d about voting rights and the threats to democracy over the past year , but that he sees the president being more proactive now : between his remarks this week and plans to travel to Georgia next week specifically to talk about voting rights reform .\nVoting rights advocates said it was important to hear Biden clearly and specifically condemn anti-democratic forces .\nBut they ultimately have their eyes on key voting rights legislation .\nProtecting American democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond holding those responsible for Jan. 6 responsible for their actions \u2014 the real goal is passing those voter protection measures , which a majority of Republicans in the Senate oppose .\nBiden directly pointing to voting reform bills as a means to stem the tide of anti-voter access bills underwritten by election denial ideology was a welcome sign to voting rights advocates .\n\u201c Republicans will say , Oh , he 's politicizing this solemn day of remembrance or whatever , \u201d Waldman said .\n\u201c Every major speech by presidents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a political purpose , \u201d he added , referring to the Gettysburg Address and Bill Clinton \u2019 s speech after the Oklahoma City bombing , a right-wing terrorist attack .\nOn the eve of the anniversary , Rev .\nLeah Daughtry , campaign manager with Fighting for Our Vote , said that she wanted to see Biden make a clear connection between the events of Jan. 6 and the need for voting rights protection to counter the ongoing threats to elections and democracy in the US .\n\u201c I want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , of what our principles are , what our higher calling is , and then I want to see him tie that to the existential threat that we have right now , \u201d Daughtry said .\n\u201c That we should n't take for granted that what happened on Jan. 6 can never happen again .\nThat he is fully committed with everything that he and the administration has to ensure that our voting rights are protected.\n\u201d Two bills , the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to voters ' rights since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 .\nThe first bill would set national standards for elections , outlaw gerrymandering , enshrine the right to vote by mail , and standardize voter ID laws .\nThe second would reestablish antidiscrimination protections stripped away from the Voting Rights Act by two Supreme Court decisions in recent years , which has left voters of color , in particular , vulnerable to having their access to voting cut off by state and local officials .\n\u201c In response to Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppression wave , \u201d Waldman said .\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged the Senate to pass voting rights reforms in response to Jan. 6 in a `` Dear Colleague '' letter on Monday .\n\u201c January 6th was a symptom of a broader illness \u2014 an effort to delegitimize our election process and the Senate must advance systemic democracy reforms to repair our republic or else the events of that day will not be an aberration \u2014 they will be the new norm , \u201d Schumer wrote .\nSenate Democrats support both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to get past Republicans , in an evenly divided Senate where it takes 60 votes to pass any legislation because of the filibuster .\nThe current challenge for Biden and Senate Democrats is to convince Sens .\nJoe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to support changes to Senate procedure that would provide an exception to filibuster rules , preventing Republicans from shooting down voting rights legislation .\n\u201c I mean , it 's just been a series of unfortunate events and fumbles , \u201d New Georgia Project CEO Ns\u00e9 Ufot said about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform bills .\nWhile voting rights advocates acknowledge that Biden may not have more forcefully called out Republicans for stalling voting reform \u2014 the way activists have \u2014 because he may need them on his side to pass other aspects of his agenda , Ufot said she \u2019 s disappointed he hasn \u2019 t used his years of experience and relationships in the Senate to push harder for voting rights bills .\n\u201c I did not serve four decades in the United States Senate .\nI ca n't whip votes .\nI ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of the filibuster .\nThey can , \u201d she said .\n\u201c So there are things that I can and should be doing , as an organizer , as an activist , as a citizen .\nAnd there are things that only the president of the United States can do.\n\u201d Daughtry , by contrast , said she thought Biden has been forceful already in pushing for the bills .\n`` I want to see him continue to double down with his colleagues , his former colleagues in the Senate , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in ensuring that we can pass voting rights legislation , '' she said .\n\u201c The buck stops with the United States Senate , and they 've got to do their jobs to preserve democracy , \u201d Daughtry said .\n\u201c It is not the president 's job alone .\n\u201d",

        "content": "Judges are figuring out in real time what the consequences should be for storming the Capitol on Jan. 6 .\nWASHINGTON \u2014 What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy ?\nFor Jordan Stotts of Minnesota , it was two years on probation , with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home .\nHe scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol , was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda , and vowed to return , posting on Facebook : \u201c Patriots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 ll be back !\n\u201d For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky , it was five years on probation plus a $ 5,000 fine .\nProsecutors had wanted jail time for Lori \u2014 she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot , \u201c I would do it again tomorrow \u201d \u2014 but a judge didn \u2019 t agree .\nFor Boyd Camper of Montana , it was two months in jail .\nAs he joined the mob streaming into the building , he filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a news crew outside later , \u201c We \u2019 re going to take this damn place.\n\u201d The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia .\nThe court \u2019 s members \u2014 a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees \u2014 have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent , and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment .\nThey just don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose .\nSome have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government \u2019 s recommendation ; others have been more lenient .\nSome have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense .\nIt is \u201c no wonder , \u201d US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing , that some people \u201c are confused about whether what happened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.\n\u201d Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden \u2019 s win in 2020 .\nBut the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath .\nThe most common sentence has been probation , with a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed in , according to BuzzFeed News \u2019 tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack .\nProbation means people can mostly return to their normal lives , with conditions \u2014 they have to regularly report to a probation officer , get permission to travel , submit to a home inspection at any time , and hold a job .\nThey can \u2019 t have guns or other weapons .\nViolating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor , with most deals featuring the same charge : illegally parading in the Capitol , which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $ 5,000 fine .\nIn more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings , judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention .\nTwo-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn \u2019 t receive any jail time .\nIf you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal fights in its aftermath , contact this reporter at zoe.tillman @ buzzfeed.com , or see other ways to send tips here .\nProsecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event , which temporarily halted Congress \u2019 certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power .\nNo one has been charged with sedition or insurrection , both rarely brought offenses .\nA top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with conspiracy ; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime .\nOf the 700-plus people charged so far , BuzzFeed News \u2019 analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony .\nThe most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding ; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress , such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years in prison , although nonviolent , first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that , and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor .\nThere are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police , carrying or using weapons , and civil disorder .\nEveryone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol , disorderly conduct , and parading , a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes .\nIt \u2019 s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources , but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system , where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains .\nThis process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused ( the rioters ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences crafted by a single judge .\nThe riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election , but there \u2019 s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated .\nJudges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6 .\nThey \u2019 ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal activity committed at the Capitol .\nWith most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper , judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters .\nThey \u2019 re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat \u2014 potential or actualized \u2014 posed by the mob .\nHow many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol ?\nDid they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window ?\nWhere did they go ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did they capture photos or video ?\nDid they take selfies , and did they look happy to be there ?\nDid they witness violence or vandalism and keep going ?\nDid they publicly brag about it online , or only send messages to friends and family , and does that distinction matter ?\nIs the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught , and , really , how can anyone know for sure ?\nAnd the big question that \u2019 s loomed over the conclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election ?\nFor some judges , the obvious answer is jail .\nIn the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress , judges have imposed months or years of prison .\nThe length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison , but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidate they supported loses an election , from taking matters into their own hands .\nUS District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders .\nAt a sentencing in early October , she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail , becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended .\nShe chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like \u201c entertainment \u201d \u2014 he \u2019 d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The capital is ours !\n\u201d and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building \u2014 and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others .\n\u201c There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government , beyond sitting at home , \u201d Chutkan said at the time .\nOther judges aren \u2019 t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level , nonviolent crimes , or if a relatively short stint in jail is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment \u201c hurt , \u201d in the words of one judge .\nThey \u2019 ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation , fines , home detention , computer monitoring , social media restrictions , mental health treatment , job training , and community service .\nWith new cases being filed every week , 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out .\nThere \u2019 s too little data , for instance , to say whether the political pathways that judges took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hand down .\nJudges nominated by presidents of both parties , including Trump , have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters .\nBut most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings , and some judges haven \u2019 t sentenced anyone yet .\nStill , enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice .\nThey \u2019 re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most hearings , a pandemic-related expansion of access .\nThey \u2019 re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that \u2019 s unfolding in Congress , and they \u2019 re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing \u2014 sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge \u2019 s decision or comments .\nThere was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being \u201c even-handed \u201d in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden , calling it a \u201c false equivalence.\n\u201d It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges ; McFadden was nominated by Trump , Chutkan by former president Barack Obama .\nThere was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge .\nSeveral judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd , who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation .\nMorgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol .\nMorgan-Lloyd \u2019 s lawyer has insisted her client got \u201c played \u201d by Fox and was honest with Lamberth , but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse .\nLamberth , meanwhile , has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd .\nWhen Frank Scavo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor , Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for , sentencing Scavo to 60 days .\nA few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences .\nUS District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision .\nUS District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very torn \u201d because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court .\nNichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days , citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others .\nIt \u2019 s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions .\nThe court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Russia probe \u2014 as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .\nThe sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart .\nA prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol , far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on .\nProsecutors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there \u2019 s a target number for when they \u2019 ll end the investigation .\nThe seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time .\nPaul Hodgkins of Florida , who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress , had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn \u2019 t engaged in violence or destruction ; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a \u201c TRUMP \u201d flag .\nUS District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn \u2019 t an option and ordered him to spend eight months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months sought by prosecutors .\nIt was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal .\nPeople needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process \u201c will have severe consequences , \u201d the judge said at the time .\nOf the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense , 36 \u2014 more than half \u2014 received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty , according to BuzzFeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases where judges rejected the government \u2019 s recommendation of prison time altogether , nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government \u2019 s request , and 13 cases where judges didn \u2019 t agree with the government \u2019 s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation .\nForty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors \u2014 roughly two-thirds \u2014 avoided time behind bars , receiving home confinement and probation , or probation alone .\nThe remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were more severe than what the government requested , with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation .\nNine people received prison sentences that fell below the government \u2019 s recommendation , and six received time behind bars that matched the government \u2019 s request .\nJail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months , although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time they \u2019 d served .\nUS District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail , less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he \u2019 d been involved in a physical confrontation with police .\nHogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time .\nBut he explained that he didn \u2019 t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn \u2019 t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck an officer with his fist .\nThe person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons , but some cases feature similar overarching narratives .\nRussell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook \u2014 \u201c The Capitol is ours right now , \u201d he said at one point \u2014 and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward .\nThe government asked for two weeks in jail .\nJackson sentenced him to 30 days .\nProsecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado , arguing he \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breach like a \u201c vacation \u201d by taking and posing for photos , and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence .\nHowell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation .\nHowell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors \u2019 decision not to press more serious charges against participants .\nBut in several misdemeanor cases , she \u2019 s rejected the government \u2019 s jail recommendations , pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid \u201c unwarranted \u201d differences .\nShe blasted the government \u2019 s \u201c muddled \u201d approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts .\nHowell \u2019 s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith , a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse .\nProsecutors had asked for three months of incarceration .\nAs part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first .\nSome judges have turned to hitting people \u2019 s pockets .\nIn 16 cases , judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail ; in 13 of those cases , the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government \u2019 s recommendation .\nFines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 $ 500 for a misdemeanor plea , and $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 for a felony plea .\nBetween fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements , the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $ 148,500 , roughly 10 % of the nearly $ 1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol .\nWhen US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons , overruling the government \u2019 s request for jail time for Lori Vinson , he explained that one reason for that was he didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her was worth it .\nHe said that he \u2019 d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bI want the sentence to hurt , because people have to understand that if you do something like this , it \u2019 s going to hurt , \u201d Walton said , ordering them each to pay $ 5,000 .\nWalton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida .\nThe prosecutor asked for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was more serious because of how far he \u2019 d made it into the building \u2014 he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery , smiling , with a caption that included , \u201c This is our house \u201d \u2014 and the fact that he recorded assaults on police , knocked on doors , and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later .\nWalton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $ 5,000 fine and spend three years on probation .\nThe judge said he believed that participating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit incarceration .\nBut he said he also didn \u2019 t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant , and that it wouldn \u2019 t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation .\nSome judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known .\nThey \u2019 ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection , disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c political prisoners , \u201d and called out some of the bold-face names who haven \u2019 t been criminally charged \u2014 Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen ( and continue to do so ) .\nWhen US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government \u2019 s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida , the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation , plus a set of additional conditions including mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support .\nThe judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an \u201c unprecedented \u201d series of events , spurred on by Trump and his allies who \u201c bear much responsibility \u201d for what happened .\nAt a sentencing in November , US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was \u201c a pawn in a game that \u2019 s played and directed by people who should know better.\n\u201d Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos , who entered the Capitol through a broken window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he walked through the building , and yelled , \u201c They left !\nWe did it !\n\u201d as he left .\nHe came to law enforcement \u2019 s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting , \u201c Trump 2020 !\n\u201d Mehta sentenced him to 14 days .\n\u201c People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not , \u201d Mehta said .\n\u201c Regrettably , people like Mr. Lolos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.\n\u201d No judge has found that individual rioters weren \u2019 t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump .\n\u201c No one was swept away to the Capitol , \u201d Jackson said at Russell Peterson \u2019 s sentencing this month .\n\u201c No one was carried .\nThe rioters were adults .\nAnd this defendant , like hundreds of others , walked there on his own two feet and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable , but this is not their day in court , it is yours.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned on Friday that pediatric hospitals are seeing record numbers of children with COVID-19 , as the Omicron variant surges nationwide .\nUS coronavirus cases are currently higher than they \u2019 ve ever been , averaging around 600,000 new cases reported daily ( itself an undercount ) , with hospitalization rates that have increased for people of all ages , according to Walensky , who briefed reporters on Friday .\nMore than 1,200 people a day are dying of COVID-19 nationwide .\n\u201c While children still have the lowest rate of hospitalization of any group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to any prior point in the pandemic , \u201d Walensky said .\n\u201c Sadly , we are seeing the rates of hospitalization increasing for children 0 to 4 , children who are not yet currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.\n\u201d As of Jan. 1 , the rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations among children under 4 was 4.3 cases per 100,000 .\nThat \u2019 s almost four times higher than it is among kids 5 to 17 , who are eligible for vaccination , according to Walensky , and more than twice the hospitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time last year .\nShe added that CDC data does show that children above the age of 4 are more likely to be in the hospital if they are unvaccinated .\nWalensky pointed out that some unknown number of these cases are incidental \u2014 children who test positive when they are hospitalized for non-COVID reasons .\nMany of the case reports of children come from asymptomatic kids who enter the hospital for elective procedures or other illnesses , she added , complicating the picture for epidemiologists trying to figure out risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of epidemiology and pediatrics at UCSF , said these numbers show that COVID is widespread , is infecting children , and some proportion of them will be hospitalized .\n\u201c Hospitalizations are going up .\nThere 's no reason to think that they would n't go up in children , \u201d he said , adding that \u201c children do n't seem to be as unsusceptible to this as they have been to earlier strains.\n\u201d But he thinks it \u2019 s too early to say that the proportion of infected children requiring hospitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC data is mostly from the northeastern region .\nNot knowing how many of these hospital cases are incidental makes the numbers even harder to interpret .\n\u201c I 've seen in London , where they actually do publish these data , that a third of COVID hospitalizations are incidental findings , \u201d he added .\nStill , he said that COVID-19 is a serious disease for children , and protecting them while Omicron surges across the country is paramount .\n\u201c In 2020 COVID was the seventh leading cause of death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutherford said .\n\u201c It is a big deal .\nAnd people who pooh-pooh it and say 'oh , it 's no big deal ' are blind to facts.\n\u201d Masking in school and other indoor settings is helpful , he said , but what \u2019 s most important is for parents to try to ensure that everyone their child is in contact with is vaccinated and boosted ( if they are eligible ) .\nIt remains an open question whether Omicron is any more likely to lead to more severe disease in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen with Delta , Walensky said .\n\u201c We are seeing a rise in hospitalizations , both because they are coming in with COVID but also because they 're screening in for COVID , '' she said .\n`` [ We ] have not yet seen a signal that there is any increased severity in this age demographic.\n\u201d Throughout the briefing , Walensky also defended the CDC against complaints that recent changes to protocols for isolating or quarantining after an infection , down to five days without symptoms , were confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outside experts .\n\u201c This virus has changed , and it 's constantly throwing up curveballs , \u201d Walensky said in response .\nAs this virus changes , the CDC will have to change its guidance when working with state and local public health \u201c to provide recommendations that are most feasible and can be implemented in communities across the country , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The past few weeks have been challenging for all of us .\n\u201d",

        "content": "On the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection , President Joe Biden gave a speech condemning former president Donald Trump for his role in inciting violence and undermining democracy , a striking departure for the president who has spent his first year in office avoiding dwelling on his predecessor .\nBiden \u2019 s speech , delivered on Capitol Hill , carefully avoided naming the former president but focused on keeping the record straight on the violent pro-Trump insurrection and the threat to American democracy that Republicans have stoked in past years .\nYet it was clear who he was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c former president \u201d and the lies he told before , during , and since the 2020 presidential election to try to undermine the results .\nIt was Biden \u2019 s clearest and most prolonged denunciation of Trump from the executive office .\n\u201c His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution .\nHe can not accept that he lost , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c For the first time in our history , a president not just lost an election , he tried to prevent a peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the Capitol.\n\u201d His decision to focus on the former president comes as Democrats weigh whether anti-Trump messaging could sink them in the midterms and as they try to outline what their party stands for instead of only what they stand against .\nUltimately , Biden \u2019 s ( accurate ) portrayal of Trump was an apparent shift to address the ongoing threats to democracy , including restrictive voting laws that ultimately undermine elections across the board .\nBiden \u2019 s tiptoe around actually naming Trump was obvious .\nThe president himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president , '' he told reporters on Capitol Hill when asked why he did n't say Trump 's name .\n`` It 's way beyond that.\n\u201d In a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack , Trump called Biden \u2019 s speech \u201c political theater \u201d and a \u201c distraction.\n\u201d '' It looks like he saw the speech .\nI guess that 's good news .\nMaybe he learned something about what it looks like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in response to Trump \u2019 s statement during the press briefing Thursday .\nPsaki did not immediately respond to an inquiry by BuzzFeed News about some of the thinking around the speech , including whether Biden might talk about Trump more as the midterms approach .\n`` Biden 's right .\nThis is a crisis in democracy , \u201d said Karthik Ganapathy , a progressive consultant with Left Flank Strategies .\n\u201c Coming up with an actual plan to solve it , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left before the midterm elections , I think that 's like a really crucial thing that a lot of people , especially progressives , feel a lot of urgency about . ''\nHe added that Biden \u2019 s most direct attempt to hold Trump accountable came as \u201c a welcome development.\n\u201d Perhaps no instance best encapsulates how striking it is for Biden to focus a speech so heavily on Trump than a comment he made last month \u2014 \u201c I don \u2019 t think about the former president \u201d \u2014 when asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for COVID before a September 2020 debate .\nBiden has previously addressed Trump on certain matters .\nIn December , he pointed out that Trump had taken a COVID-19 booster shot \u2014 `` one of the few things he and I agree on '' \u2014 before going on to condemn `` companies and personalities '' peddling lies about the pandemic .\nHe obviously also struck a direct contrast on the campaign trail not only in his own election but in other contests since .\n`` You ca n't tell the story of Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Addisu Demise , an Oakland-based Democratic strategist .\n\u201c [ Trump ] invited people to Washington , incited them to violence , I would say , and in my mind it would be a denial of history to erase him from the day.\n\u201d Demise said he does n't expect Biden 's focus on Trump to carry into the coming weeks and months as Democrats prepare for the midterms and the next presidential election , because it would distract from talking about his own agenda and achievements .\nBut rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been `` malpractice '' not to talk about Trump 's role in the attempted insurrection on its anniversary .\nLooking at the bigger picture , though , Demise said it would n't make sense for Biden to rag on Trump , who , despite his ongoing political pull , should not be the focus of this presidency .\n`` He was elected in large part to turn the page on the Trump era .\nAnd if he continues to focus on that , it takes him away from his job , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tomorrow , '' Demise said .\nDemocrats have spent a lot of time working to keep the record straight on the events of Jan. 6 against efforts by Republicans to rewrite history , and Biden \u2019 s speech was true to that .\nFrom the start , Democrats built a detailed case illustrating Trump \u2019 s role in inciting the violence , including during the impeachment trial last year \u2014 which he was acquitted of by Republicans .\nTheir efforts continue today : One of the commemorative events Democrats are hosting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderated discussion featuring the Democratic leaders of each chamber of Congress and renowned historians .\n`` I think using this anniversary to stand up for our country , our ideals , and what we believe in as a nation is critical , \u201d said Scott Mulhauser , a Democratic strategist and former Biden adviser .\n\u201c The scars of that day still have n't healed for so many , and part of the way we recover as a country is to ensure that our democracy stands .

        "content": "As we head into year three of the COVID-19 pandemic , the updates and recommendations for how to stay safe from COVID , particularly for children , seem to be evolving as fast as a new variant in an unvaccinated population .\n( Sorry , pandemic humor . )\nIn all seriousness , as Omicron surges , the new guidance for children \u2019 s vaccines , boosters , masking , and school safety are moving so quickly it \u2019 s hard for parents and caregivers to keep up .\nThe result is often pandemic-related confusion : Are cloth masks enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to school based on symptoms and testing ?\nIs COVID really as bad or worse than familiar childhood ailments like the flu and RSV ?\nAnd , most importantly , do I really need to test my child for COVID every time they get a sniffle ?\nIf you \u2019 re sick of asking people in the group chat or on the playground ( and getting very strong and likely incorrect opinions ) , we asked some real experts for the answers to common questions .\nHere \u2019 s what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID symptoms in children ?\nChildren generally have symptoms just like adults , including a cough , fever , a runny nose , and sore throat .\nThe latest development is that kids with COVID can often have croup , which causes a distinctive cough , hoarseness , and labored breathing .\n\u201c For many of the young kids I have been seeing , they present with croup , \u201d said Dr. Jennifer Shu , an Atlanta-based pediatrician .\nSometimes the only symptoms in babies are fussiness and increased crying because COVID can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baby may be crying and you can \u2019 t pinpoint a reason for it , \u201d she said .\nChildren also get a loss of taste and smell , just like adults , but they may have more trouble articulating that than an adult would , said Dr. Dean Blumberg , chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children \u2019 s Hospital .\nIn general , kids tend to have a less severe illness than adults .\nUnfortunately , hospitalizations are on the rise for children , including babies and toddlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , hospitalizations are at the highest point since the start of the pandemic , according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky .\nMy kid always has a runny nose , especially in winter .\nDo I need to get them tested every time they \u2019 re stuffed up ?\nTesting every kid for COVID every day is \u201c just not practical , \u201d said George Rutherford , a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of California , San Francisco .\nHe doesn \u2019 t think children need to be tested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure or symptoms of \u201c more severe upper respiratory infections.\n\u201d Blumberg agreed and said when it comes to testing kids , it 's more important to focus on new symptoms ; a child might have a runny nose due to allergies or something else .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t think there is anything out of the ordinary with your child , then you don \u2019 t have to test because of symptoms such as a runny nose , \u201d he said .\nHowever , Shu recommends that given the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a good idea to err on the side of caution and test children .\n\u201c We are seeing so much COVID compared to other cold viruses , even higher than flu in my area , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The vast majority of viruses I \u2019 m seeing are COVID.\n\u201d She added , \u201c There \u2019 s a ton .\nCOVID can look like any other respiratory illness.\n\u201d How accurate are rapid tests for young children under the age of 5 ?\nRutherford said there doesn \u2019 t appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform for children versus adults .\nRapid tests should work even when used in babies , experts told us .\nThat said , false negatives are common in rapid COVID tests early in an infection .\nYou may need to retest after a negative result , particularly if a child has respiratory symptoms .\n\u201c The timing can be tricky , \u201d Shu said .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t catch it on the right day where there \u2019 s enough virus to trigger that test to turn positive , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d A positive result on a rapid antigen test is much more reliable in general ( meaning if the result is positive , your child almost certainly has COVID if they also have symptoms ) , although following up with a PCR test to confirm is recommended .\nHow strong is the evidence that kids in preschool or at any age should be wearing masks ?\nThe evidence for masking in preschool \u201c is strong , \u201d Rutherford said , as long as the child is over 2 years old , since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children .\nThe data doesn \u2019 t come directly from preschools , but Rutherford said there \u2019 s \u201c really good \u201d evidence for the effectiveness of masks in elementary schools , and there \u2019 s no reason to think preschools would be different .\nBlumberg said surgical masks provide 60 % \u201370 % protection , and he prefers those over cloth masks , which are less standardized .\n( Any mask is better than no mask . )\nWhen Shu is choosing a surgical mask , she looks for one with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 4-ply , which tends to offer the best protection .\nYour child can use a medical mask and a cloth mask over it to be extra safe , or they can wear a KN95 or N95 mask if they can tolerate it .\nWhile N95s come in smaller sizes and can be worn by children , they can be harder to breathe though , and it \u2019 s important to find a mask that fits well and that a child will actually wear .\n\u201c If they aren \u2019 t comfortable wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all , \u201d Blumberg said .\nParents of children who are immunocompromised may prefer the greater protection that comes with an N95 ; some people , he added , buy several kinds to find one their child is comfortable with .\nKids often adapt to mask-wearing ( and wearing them correctly ) better than adults , he said .\nLetting kids choose and decorate masks can increase the chances that they will wear them .\nChildren may also play with the masks , get them wet by biting or chewing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly than you \u2019 d think , Shu said , so it \u2019 s important to swap them out as necessary .\nSome schools/preschools let kids come in with a negative rapid test , even when they have minor cold symptoms .\nOthers require no symptoms for 24 hours and a negative PCR .\nWhich policy makes more sense ?\n\u201c You do n't want colds passed around schools either , right ?\n\u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c But on the other hand , one of the reasons we have preschools is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a benefit of it .\nAnd if you send them home every time they sneeze , you 're going to have a lot of unhappy parents.\n\u201d Rutherford said it makes sense for schools to continue to follow whatever pre-COVID sickness policies they had in place , with an added layer of COVID testing for children with more severe upper respiratory symptoms .\nBut he said this testing should be rapid , not PCR , which usually takes multiple days to deliver results .\nBlumberg said it \u2019 s \u201c understandable \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are having symptoms , like coughing , to stay home until they are better .\n\u201c Schools may be extra sensitive to respiratory symptoms , even in a setting of a negative test , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c It just makes everyone uncomfortable to be around somebody who is coughing or sneezing in the age of COVID.\n\u201d Shu recommends sticking to CDC guidelines if a child does test positive for COVID .\nThe CDC recommends that kids who test positive stay out of school for 10 days , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency recently shortened the isolation period to 5 days for adults who are asymptomatic , followed by five more days of mask-wearing .\nIt \u2019 s a different story for kids , who are at school all day and have to take their masks off to eat lunch , exercise in gym class , and for other reasons .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not like they can continue to stay masked for the second five days of that 10-day isolation , \u201d Shu said .\nHow long does COVID last in kids ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ can range from very mild or nonexistent to more severe , such as a high fever or chest pain , which may necessitate a hospital visit for oxygen , depending on other risk factors and whether they are vaccinated , The symptoms can last as short as one day , Shu said , but usually , it \u2019 s about a week or sometimes even longer .\n\u201c A lot of my patients are having a cough linger for three to four weeks , \u201d Shu said .\nHow worried should I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nMore research still needs to be done to determine how often children \u2014 especially the youngest ones \u2014 get long COVID , which can make people sick for months .\nLong COVID , which can include memory and sleep problems , fatigue , and shortness of breath , is more common in adults than children .\nAnd it \u2019 s more common in older children and teens than younger kids .\nAbout 20 % to 40 % of teens who get infected may develop long COVID , said Blumberg .\n\u201c In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we don \u2019 t have good numbers on that.\n\u201d However , the symptoms are similar in children and can include fatigue and difficulty sleeping .\n\u201c Older children will describe fuzzy thinking , that they are just not able to think clearly or they might have memory issues , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c Those are the kind of long COVID symptoms we have been seeing in children.\n\u201d Shu has an 11-year-old patient who got COVID early in the pandemic and lost his sense of smell and taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to be as active in sports as in the past due to chest pain , breathing problems , and shortness of breath , she said .\nWhere does COVID-19 fall on the scale of severity for childhood diseases ?\nIs it more or less serious than the flu or RSV ?\nAbout 100 to 150 children die each year in the US from the flu , and 100 to 500 from the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .\nIn comparison , more than 800 children have died of COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic .\nAbout 7.9 million children in the US , or more than one in 10 , have tested positive for COVID .\nIn 2020 , COVID was the seventh-leading cause of death in children in the US .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s worse than RSV and worse than influenza , \u201d Blumberg said .\nPart of the reason that the mortality rate is so high with COVID is that no one in the population had any immunity to this new virus .\nAs more children get vaccinated for COVID ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are exposed to the virus , hopefully , fewer children will get severely sick and die , he said .\n\u201c Getting vaccinated is the safest thing for children , \u201d he said .\nIs the COVID vaccine safe for kids ?\nYes , it \u2019 s considered very safe .\nNo children have died due to vaccination , unlike COVID , which as we said can be potentially life-threatening .\nMore than 9 billion doses of vaccine have been given worldwide , so there \u2019 s a \u201c proven track record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 23 % of children 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated , and about 62 % of children 12 to 17 .\nThe vaccine is now approved for children 5 and older , and kids 12 and older can get vaccinated and a booster .\n\u201c I am disappointed that the numbers are so low , \u201d she said .\nMany children who are eligible are not getting vaccinated .\n\u201c Any loss of a child \u2019 s life is tragic , so why not try to avoid that ?\n\u201d said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Academy of Pediatrics .\n\u201c I often have people say in hindsight Gosh , I wish I had gotten the vaccine .\nI \u2019 ve never had someone say , Gosh , I wish I hadn \u2019 t gotten the vaccine.\n\u201d How can you best protect babies and children who are too young to get vaccinated or wear masks ?\nAs we said , masks aren \u2019 t appropriate for children under 2 , and kids under 5 can \u2019 t get vaccinated .\nMost newborns will have some protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected .\nVaccination is highly recommended for people who are pregnant due to the high risk of COVID complications in pregnancy as well as the ability to generate antibodies that can be passed to the fetus .\n\u201c I do n't think infants are susceptible until after six months of life , because they get a lot of maternal antibody transplacentally and through breast milk , \u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c Now , after seven months , eight , nine months , as maternal antibodies start to wane , we know of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not common at all.\n\u201d The best way to protect youngsters is to make sure the people around them wear masks , are vaccinated , and have had their boosters .\n\u201c Surrounding the baby with a \u2018 bubble \u2019 of people who are vaccinated is a great first step , \u201d said Dr. Danielle Zerr , head of pediatric infectious diseases at Seattle Children \u2019 s Hospital in an email .\n\u201c In addition , depending on community transmission rates , other steps would include avoiding crowds ( especially indoors ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in your life who are vaccinated , and avoiding contact with symptomatic people .\n\u201d",

        "content": "As we head into year three of the COVID-19 pandemic , the updates and recommendations for how to stay safe from COVID , particularly for children , seem to be evolving as fast as a new variant in an unvaccinated population .\n( Sorry , pandemic humor . )\nIn all seriousness , as Omicron surges , the new guidance for children \u2019 s vaccines , boosters , masking , and school safety are moving so quickly it \u2019 s hard for parents and caregivers to keep up .\nThe result is often pandemic-related confusion : Are cloth masks enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to school based on symptoms and testing ?\nIs COVID really as bad or worse than familiar childhood ailments like the flu and RSV ?\nAnd , most importantly , do I really need to test my child for COVID every time they get a sniffle ?\nIf you \u2019 re sick of asking people in the group chat or on the playground ( and getting very strong and likely incorrect opinions ) , we asked some real experts for the answers to common questions .\nHere \u2019 s what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID symptoms in children ?\nChildren generally have symptoms just like adults , including a cough , fever , a runny nose , and sore throat .\nThe latest development is that kids with COVID can often have croup , which causes a distinctive cough , hoarseness , and labored breathing .\n\u201c For many of the young kids I have been seeing , they present with croup , \u201d said Dr. Jennifer Shu , an Atlanta-based pediatrician .\nSometimes the only symptoms in babies are fussiness and increased crying because COVID can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baby may be crying and you can \u2019 t pinpoint a reason for it , \u201d she said .\nChildren also get a loss of taste and smell , just like adults , but they may have more trouble articulating that than an adult would , said Dr. Dean Blumberg , chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children \u2019 s Hospital .\nIn general , kids tend to have a less severe illness than adults .\nUnfortunately , hospitalizations are on the rise for children , including babies and toddlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , hospitalizations are at the highest point since the start of the pandemic , according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky .\nMy kid always has a runny nose , especially in winter .\nDo I need to get them tested every time they \u2019 re stuffed up ?\nTesting every kid for COVID every day is \u201c just not practical , \u201d said George Rutherford , a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of California , San Francisco .\nHe doesn \u2019 t think children need to be tested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure or symptoms of \u201c more severe upper respiratory infections.\n\u201d Blumberg agreed and said when it comes to testing kids , it 's more important to focus on new symptoms ; a child might have a runny nose due to allergies or something else .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t think there is anything out of the ordinary with your child , then you don \u2019 t have to test because of symptoms such as a runny nose , \u201d he said .\nHowever , Shu recommends that given the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a good idea to err on the side of caution and test children .\n\u201c We are seeing so much COVID compared to other cold viruses , even higher than flu in my area , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The vast majority of viruses I \u2019 m seeing are COVID.\n\u201d She added , \u201c There \u2019 s a ton .\nCOVID can look like any other respiratory illness.\n\u201d How accurate are rapid tests for young children under the age of 5 ?\nRutherford said there doesn \u2019 t appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform for children versus adults .\nRapid tests should work even when used in babies , experts told us .\nThat said , false negatives are common in rapid COVID tests early in an infection .\nYou may need to retest after a negative result , particularly if a child has respiratory symptoms .\n\u201c The timing can be tricky , \u201d Shu said .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t catch it on the right day where there \u2019 s enough virus to trigger that test to turn positive , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d A positive result on a rapid antigen test is much more reliable in general ( meaning if the result is positive , your child almost certainly has COVID if they also have symptoms ) , although following up with a PCR test to confirm is recommended .\nHow strong is the evidence that kids in preschool or at any age should be wearing masks ?\nThe evidence for masking in preschool \u201c is strong , \u201d Rutherford said , as long as the child is over 2 years old , since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children .\nThe data doesn \u2019 t come directly from preschools , but Rutherford said there \u2019 s \u201c really good \u201d evidence for the effectiveness of masks in elementary schools , and there \u2019 s no reason to think preschools would be different .\nBlumberg said surgical masks provide 60 % \u201370 % protection , and he prefers those over cloth masks , which are less standardized .\n( Any mask is better than no mask . )\nWhen Shu is choosing a surgical mask , she looks for one with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 4-ply , which tends to offer the best protection .\nYour child can use a medical mask and a cloth mask over it to be extra safe , or they can wear a KN95 or N95 mask if they can tolerate it .\nWhile N95s come in smaller sizes and can be worn by children , they can be harder to breathe though , and it \u2019 s important to find a mask that fits well and that a child will actually wear .\n\u201c If they aren \u2019 t comfortable wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all , \u201d Blumberg said .\nParents of children who are immunocompromised may prefer the greater protection that comes with an N95 ; some people , he added , buy several kinds to find one their child is comfortable with .\nKids often adapt to mask-wearing ( and wearing them correctly ) better than adults , he said .\nLetting kids choose and decorate masks can increase the chances that they will wear them .\nChildren may also play with the masks , get them wet by biting or chewing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly than you \u2019 d think , Shu said , so it \u2019 s important to swap them out as necessary .\nSome schools/preschools let kids come in with a negative rapid test , even when they have minor cold symptoms .\nOthers require no symptoms for 24 hours and a negative PCR .\nWhich policy makes more sense ?\n\u201c You do n't want colds passed around schools either , right ?\n\u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c But on the other hand , one of the reasons we have preschools is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a benefit of it .\nAnd if you send them home every time they sneeze , you 're going to have a lot of unhappy parents.\n\u201d Rutherford said it makes sense for schools to continue to follow whatever pre-COVID sickness policies they had in place , with an added layer of COVID testing for children with more severe upper respiratory symptoms .\nBut he said this testing should be rapid , not PCR , which usually takes multiple days to deliver results .\nBlumberg said it \u2019 s \u201c understandable \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are having symptoms , like coughing , to stay home until they are better .\n\u201c Schools may be extra sensitive to respiratory symptoms , even in a setting of a negative test , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c It just makes everyone uncomfortable to be around somebody who is coughing or sneezing in the age of COVID.\n\u201d Shu recommends sticking to CDC guidelines if a child does test positive for COVID .\nThe CDC recommends that kids who test positive stay out of school for 10 days , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency recently shortened the isolation period to 5 days for adults who are asymptomatic , followed by five more days of mask-wearing .\nIt \u2019 s a different story for kids , who are at school all day and have to take their masks off to eat lunch , exercise in gym class , and for other reasons .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not like they can continue to stay masked for the second five days of that 10-day isolation , \u201d Shu said .\nHow long does COVID last in kids ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ can range from very mild or nonexistent to more severe , such as a high fever or chest pain , which may necessitate a hospital visit for oxygen , depending on other risk factors and whether they are vaccinated .\nThe symptoms can last as short as one day , Shu said , but usually , it \u2019 s about a week or sometimes even longer .\n\u201c A lot of my patients are having a cough linger for three to four weeks , \u201d Shu said .\nHow worried should I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nMore research still needs to be done to determine how often children \u2014 especially the youngest ones \u2014 get long COVID , which can make people sick for months .\nLong COVID , which can include memory and sleep problems , fatigue , and shortness of breath , is more common in adults than children .\nAnd it \u2019 s more common in older children and teens than younger kids .\nAbout 20 % to 40 % of teens who get infected may develop long COVID , said Blumberg .\n\u201c In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we don \u2019 t have good numbers on that.\n\u201d However , the symptoms are similar in children and can include fatigue and difficulty sleeping .\n\u201c Older children will describe fuzzy thinking , that they are just not able to think clearly or they might have memory issues , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c Those are the kind of long COVID symptoms we have been seeing in children.\n\u201d Shu has an 11-year-old patient who got COVID early in the pandemic and lost his sense of smell and taste for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to be as active in sports as in the past due to chest pain , breathing problems , and shortness of breath , she said .\nWhere does COVID-19 fall on the scale of severity for childhood diseases ?\nIs it more or less serious than the flu or RSV ?\nAbout 100 to 150 children die each year in the US from the flu , and 100 to 500 from the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .\nIn comparison , more than 800 children have died of COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic .\nAbout 7.9 million children in the US , or more than one in 10 , have tested positive for COVID .\nIn 2020 , COVID was the seventh-leading cause of death in children in the US .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s worse than RSV and worse than influenza , \u201d Blumberg said .\nPart of the reason that the mortality rate is so high with COVID is that no one in the population had any immunity to this new virus .\nAs more children get vaccinated for COVID ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are exposed to the virus , hopefully , fewer children will get severely sick and die , he said .\n\u201c Getting vaccinated is the safest thing for children , \u201d he said .\nIs the COVID vaccine safe for kids ?\nYes , it \u2019 s considered very safe .\nNo children have died due to vaccination , unlike COVID , which as we said can be potentially life-threatening .\nMore than 9 billion doses of vaccine have been given worldwide , so there \u2019 s a \u201c proven track record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 23 % of children 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated , and about 62 % of children 12 to 17 .\nThe vaccine is now approved for children 5 and older , and kids 12 and older can get vaccinated and a booster .\n\u201c I am disappointed that the numbers are so low , \u201d she said .\nMany children who are eligible are not getting vaccinated .\n\u201c Any loss of a child \u2019 s life is tragic , so why not try to avoid that ?\n\u201d said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Academy of Pediatrics .\n\u201c I often have people say in hindsight Gosh , I wish I had gotten the vaccine .\nI \u2019 ve never had someone say , Gosh , I wish I hadn \u2019 t gotten the vaccine.\n\u201d How can you best protect babies and children who are too young to get vaccinated or wear masks ?\nAs we said , masks aren \u2019 t appropriate for children under 2 , and kids under 5 can \u2019 t get vaccinated .\nMost newborns will have some protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected .\nVaccination is highly recommended for people who are pregnant due to the high risk of COVID complications in pregnancy as well as the ability to generate antibodies that can be passed to the fetus .\n\u201c I do n't think infants are susceptible until after six months of life , because they get a lot of maternal antibody transplacentally and through breast milk , \u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c Now , after seven months , eight , nine months , as maternal antibodies start to wane , we know of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not common at all.\n\u201d The best way to protect youngsters is to make sure the people around them wear masks , are vaccinated , and have had their boosters .\n\u201c Surrounding the baby with a \u2018 bubble \u2019 of people who are vaccinated is a great first step , \u201d said Dr. Danielle Zerr , head of pediatric infectious diseases at Seattle Children \u2019 s Hospital in an email .\n\u201c In addition , depending on community transmission rates , other steps would include avoiding crowds ( especially indoors ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in your life who are vaccinated , and avoiding contact with symptomatic people .\n\u201d",

        "content": "As we head into year three of the COVID-19 pandemic , the updates and recommendations for how to stay safe from COVID , particularly for children , seem to be evolving as fast as a new variant in an unvaccinated population .\n( Sorry , pandemic humor . )\nIn all seriousness , as Omicron surges , the new guidance for children \u2019 s vaccines , boosters , masking , and school safety are moving so quickly that it \u2019 s hard for parents and caregivers to keep up .\nThe result is often pandemic-related confusion : Are cloth masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to return to school based on symptoms and testing ?\nIs COVID really as bad as or worse than familiar childhood ailments like the flu and RSV ?\nAnd , most importantly , do parents really need to test a child for COVID every time they get a sniffle ?\nIf you \u2019 re sick of asking people in the group chat or on the playground ( and getting very strong and likely incorrect opinions ) , we asked some real experts for the answers to common questions .\nHere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the COVID symptoms in children ?\nChildren generally have symptoms just like adults , including a cough , fever , a runny nose , and sore throat .\nThe latest development is that kids with COVID can often have croup , which causes a distinctive cough , hoarseness , and labored breathing .\n\u201c For many of the young kids I have been seeing , they present with croup , \u201d said Dr. Jennifer Shu , an Atlanta-based pediatrician .\nSometimes the only symptoms in babies are fussiness and increased crying because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The baby may be crying and you can \u2019 t pinpoint a reason for it , \u201d she said .\nChildren also get a loss of taste and smell , just like adults , but they may have more trouble articulating that than an adult would , said Dr. Dean Blumberg , chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children \u2019 s Hospital .\nIn general , kids tend to have a less severe illness than adults .\nUnfortunately , hospitalizations are on the rise for children , including babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn fact , hospitalizations are at the highest point since the start of the pandemic , according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky .\nMy kid always has a runny nose , especially in winter .\nDo I need to get them tested every time they \u2019 re stuffed up ?\nTesting every kid for COVID every day is \u201c just not practical , \u201d said George Rutherford , a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of California , San Francisco .\nHe doesn \u2019 t think children need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an exposure or symptoms of \u201c more severe upper respiratory infections.\n\u201d Blumberg agreed and said when it comes to testing kids , it 's more important to focus on new symptoms ; a child might have a runny nose due to allergies or something else .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t think there is anything out of the ordinary with your child , then you don \u2019 t have to test because of symptoms such as a runny nose , \u201d he said .\nHowever , Shu recommends that given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s a good idea to err on the side of caution and test children .\n\u201c We are seeing so much COVID compared to other cold viruses , even higher than flu in my area , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The vast majority of viruses I \u2019 m seeing are COVID.\n\u201d She added , \u201c There \u2019 s a ton .\nCOVID can look like any other respiratory illness.\n\u201d How accurate are rapid tests for young children under the age of 5 ?\nRutherford said there doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they perform for children versus adults .\nRapid tests should work even when used in babies , experts told us .\nThat said , false negatives are common in rapid COVID tests early in an infection .\nYou may need to retest after a negative result , particularly if a child has respiratory symptoms .\n\u201c The timing can be tricky , \u201d Shu said .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t catch it on the right day where there \u2019 s enough virus to trigger that test to turn positive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false negative.\n\u201d A positive result on a rapid antigen test is much more reliable in general ( meaning if the result is positive , your child almost certainly has COVID if they also have symptoms ) , although following up with a PCR test to confirm is recommended .\nHow strong is the evidence that kids in preschool or at any age should be wearing masks ?\nThe evidence for masking in preschool \u201c is strong , \u201d Rutherford said , as long as the child is over 2 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for younger children .\nThe data doesn \u2019 t come directly from preschools , but Rutherford said there \u2019 s \u201c really good \u201d evidence for the effectiveness of masks in elementary schools , and there \u2019 s no reason to think preschools would be different .\nBlumberg said surgical masks provide 60 % \u201370 % protection , and he prefers those over cloth masks , which are less standardized .\n( Any mask is better than no mask . )\nWhen Shu is choosing a surgical mask , she looks for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 3- or 4-ply , which tends to offer the best protection .\nYour child can use a medical mask and a cloth mask over it to be extra safe , or they can wear a KN95 or N95 mask if they can tolerate it .\nWhile N95s come in smaller sizes and can be worn by children , they can be harder to breathe though , and it \u2019 s important to find a mask that fits well and that a child will actually wear .\n\u201c If they aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t wear it at all , \u201d Blumberg said .\nParents of children who are immunocompromised may prefer the greater protection that comes with an N95 ; some people , he added , buy several kinds to find one their child is comfortable with .\nKids often adapt to mask-wearing ( and wearing them correctly ) better than adults , he said .\nLetting kids choose and decorate masks can increase the chances that they will wear them .\nChildren may also play with the masks , get them wet by biting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them more quickly than you \u2019 d think , Shu said , so it \u2019 s important to swap them out as necessary .\nSome schools or preschools let kids come in with a negative rapid test , even when they have minor cold symptoms .\nOthers require no symptoms for 24 hours and a negative PCR .\nWhich policy makes more sense ?\n\u201c You do n't want colds passed around schools either , right ?\n\u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c But on the other hand , one of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go work .\nThat 's a benefit of it .\nAnd if you send them home every time they sneeze , you 're going to have a lot of unhappy parents.\n\u201d Rutherford said it makes sense for schools to continue to follow whatever pre-COVID sickness policies they had in place , with an added layer of COVID testing for children with more severe upper respiratory symptoms .\nBut he said this testing should be rapid , not PCR , which usually takes multiple days to deliver results .\nBlumberg said it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer that children who are having symptoms , like coughing , stay home until they are better .\n\u201c Schools may be extra sensitive to respiratory symptoms , even in a setting of a negative test , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c It just makes everyone uncomfortable to be around somebody who is coughing or sneezing in the age of COVID.\n\u201d Shu recommends sticking to CDC guidelines if a child does test positive for COVID .\nThe CDC recommends that kids who test positive stay out of school for 10 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults .\nThe agency recently shortened the isolation period to five days for adults who are asymptomatic , followed by five more days of mask-wearing .\nIt \u2019 s a different story for kids , who are at school all day and have to take their masks off to eat lunch , exercise in gym class , and for other reasons .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not like they can continue to stay masked for the second five days of that 10-day isolation , \u201d Shu said .\nHow long does COVID last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms in children can range from very mild or nonexistent to more severe , such as a high fever or chest pain , which may necessitate a hospital visit for oxygen , depending on other risk factors and whether they are vaccinated .\nThe symptoms can last as little as one day , Shu said , but usually it \u2019 s about a week or sometimes even longer .\n\u201c A lot of my patients are having a cough linger for three to four weeks , \u201d Shu said .\nHow worried should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long COVID ?\nMore research still needs to be done to determine how often children \u2014 especially the youngest ones \u2014 get long COVID , which can make people sick for months .\nLong COVID , which can include memory and sleep problems , fatigue , and shortness of breath , is more common in adults than children .\nAnd it \u2019 s more common in older children and teens than younger kids .\nAbout 20 % \u201340 % of teens who get infected may develop long COVID , said Blumberg .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , but we don \u2019 t have good numbers on that.\n\u201d However , the symptoms are similar in children and can include fatigue and difficulty sleeping .\n\u201c Older children will describe fuzzy thinking , that they are just not able to think clearly or they might have memory issues , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c Those are the kind of long COVID symptoms we have been seeing in children.\n\u201d Shu has an 11-year-old patient who got COVID early in the pandemic and lost his sense of smell and taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be able to be as active in sports as in the past because of chest pain , breathing problems , and shortness of breath , she said .\nWhere does COVID-19 fall on the scale of severity for childhood diseases ?\nIs it more or less serious than the flu or RSV ?\nAbout 100 to 150 children die each year in the US from the flu , and 100 to 500 from the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .\nIn comparison , more than 800 children have died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pandemic .\nAbout 7.9 million children in the US , or more than 1 in 10 , have tested positive for COVID .\nIn 2020 , COVID was the seventh-leading cause of death in children in the US .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s worse than RSV and worse than influenza , \u201d Blumberg said .\nPart of the reason the mortality rate is so high with COVID is that no one in the population had any immunity to this new virus .\nAs more children get vaccinated for COVID ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are exposed to the virus , hopefully , fewer children will get severely sick and die , he said .\n\u201c Getting vaccinated is the safest thing for children , \u201d he said .\nIs the COVID vaccine safe for kids ?\nYes , it \u2019 s considered very safe .\nNo children have died due to vaccination , unlike COVID , which , as we said , is potentially life-threatening .\nMore than 9 billion doses of vaccine have been given worldwide , so there \u2019 s a \u201c proven track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about 23 % of children 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated , and about 62 % of children 12 to 17 .\nThe vaccine is now approved for children 5 and older , and kids 12 and older can get vaccinated and a booster .\n\u201c I am disappointed that the numbers are so low , \u201d she said .\nMany children who are eligible are not getting vaccinated .\n\u201c Any loss of a child \u2019 s life is tragic , so why not try to avoid that ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the American Academy of Pediatrics .\n\u201c I often have people say in hindsight , 'Gosh , I wish I had gotten the vaccine . '\nI \u2019 ve never had someone say , \u2018 Gosh , I wish I hadn \u2019 t gotten the vaccine.\n\u2019 \u201d How can you best protect babies and children who are too young to get vaccinated or wear masks ?\nAs we said , masks aren \u2019 t appropriate for children under age 2 , and kids under 5 can \u2019 t get vaccinated .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers have been vaccinated or infected .\nVaccination is highly recommended for people who are pregnant because of the high risk of COVID complications in pregnancy as well as the ability to generate antibodies that can be passed to the fetus .\n\u201c I do n't think infants are susceptible until after 6 months of life because they get a lot of maternal antibody transplacentally and through breast milk , \u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c Now , after 7 months , 8 , 9 months , as maternal antibodies start to wane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , but they 're not common at all.\n\u201d The best way to protect youngsters is to make sure the people around them wear masks , are vaccinated , and have had their boosters .\n\u201c Surrounding the baby with a \u2018 bubble \u2019 of people who are vaccinated is a great first step , \u201d said Dr. Danielle Zerr , head of pediatric infectious diseases at Seattle Children \u2019 s Hospital , in an email .\n\u201c In addition , depending on community transmission rates , other steps would include avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close interaction to just the important people in your life who are vaccinated , and avoiding contact with symptomatic people .\n\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump can not be sued for pretty much anything he said while he was in the White House , including his speech on Jan. 6 that preceded the attack on the US Capitol by his supporters and his tweets throughout the day , a lawyer for the former president argued in court on Monday .\nLess than a week after the one-year anniversary of the Capitol riot , a federal judge in Washington , DC , considered the fate of three civil lawsuits seeking to hold Trump and his allies responsible for the attack \u2014 specifically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification of the 2020 election results and incite violence against police officers who tried to protect the Capitol complex .\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta asked questions that suggested he was at a minimum skeptical of Trump \u2019 s sweeping argument that he was immune against being sued for nearly anything he \u2019 d said during his four years as president .\nBut Mehta also said during the hearing that he was struggling with whether the core conspiracy claim could go forward based on the facts laid out in the lawsuits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other high-profile supporters on Jan. 6 were covered by the First Amendment \u2019 s free speech protections .\nIt was the second time in just over a month that a court considered the argument that Trump couldn \u2019 t personally be sued over things he said while he was president .\nIn early December , a federal appeals court in New York weighed efforts by Trump , backed by the Justice Department , to have the US government take over his defense against a defamation lawsuit filed by the writer E. Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuffed the argument that Trump was acting within the scope of his official duties when he said Carroll was lying after she accused him of raping her more than two decades ago .\nThe appeals court has yet to rule .\nTrump isn \u2019 t trying to involve the Justice Department in his defense against the growing number of lawsuits seeking to hold him responsible for the events of Jan. 6 .\nHe \u2019 s broadly arguing that he \u2019 s protected by a legal doctrine that shields sitting presidents from being sued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job .\nArguments on Monday focused on three of the cases : one brought by a group of congressional Democrats , one brought by Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell , and one brought by two US Capitol Police officers .\nA ruling from Mehta wo n't end the legal wrangling over Trump \u2019 s civil liability for the insurrection .\nIf Trump fails to convince Mehta to toss these first three cases , he could ask an appeals court and potentially the US Supreme Court to intervene .\nIf Trump succeeds at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there are four other civil lawsuits pending that accuse Trump of inciting the violence , plus one filed before Jan. 6 that accuses Trump of conspiring with the Republican National Committee to violate the rights of Black voters by trying to undermine the results of the election .\nTrump \u2019 s lead attorney , Jesse Binnall \u2014 a Virginia-based lawyer representing Trump in an array of postpresidency legal fights , and who counts Trump ally Michael Flynn as a former client and conservative attorney and activist Sidney Powell as a former co-counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the \u201c outer perimeters \u201d of a president \u2019 s actions while in office .\nMehta asked if Binnall wanted the judge to ignore the content of what Trump said on Jan. 6 .\nBinnall replied yes , explaining that what mattered for immunity was the type of act at issue , which in this case was a speech to the American people , something that is part of being president .\nMehta pushed back , pointing out that the lawsuits alleged that Trump had appeared at the Jan. 6 rally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for office .\nThe judge asked Binnall why that wouldn \u2019 t place Trump outside the immunity that \u2019 s meant to protect a president against being sued for actions that were part of their official duties .\nBinnall argued that there was too much overlap between a president \u2019 s duties and political motivations to try to draw a clear line .\nEven if campaign activities weren \u2019 t covered by the immunity , Binnall said , Trump \u2019 s speech on Jan. 6 was not part of his campaign .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had contacted Georgia \u2019 s top election official to ask him to \u201c find \u201d votes to overturn President Joe Biden \u2019 s win in the state .\nMehta asked Binnall if presidential immunity would apply to that type of phone call .\nBinnall said it would because a president had a constitutional duty to ensure laws were faithfully executed .\nWhen the judge noted that part of the Constitution didn \u2019 t apply to state laws , Binnall said that when it came to federal elections , state and federal functions merged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get immunity if they made defamatory statements at a campaign rally .\nBinnall said yes .\nThe judge then asked if there was anything a president could say while they were in office that they could be sued for .\nBinnall said he \u2019 d tried to think of examples and could not .\nOn the substance of the lawsuits , Mehta said that the plaintiffs had alleged a \u201c very unusual \u201d and \u201c problematic \u201d conspiracy .\nTaken together , the cases accused Trump of conspiring with high-profile allies like Rudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are being criminally prosecuted for storming the Capitol .\nThe judge noted that the lawsuits didn \u2019 t feature the kind of direct communication among co-conspirators that would normally be part of a case like this .\nHe expressed concern that it would be \u201c dangerous \u201d to build a conspiracy case off of reactions to political speech .\nJoseph Sellers , an attorney for the congressional Democrats suing Trump who argued on behalf of all three sets of plaintiffs on Monday , maintained that the lawsuits did lay out facts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d and not just a one-sided reaction to Trump \u2019 s speech .\nHe said that Trump \u2019 s supporters engaged with his social media posts leading up to Jan. 6 about coming to Washington , that Trump urged the crowd to go to the Capitol even as people yelled out about storming and invading the building , and that Trump failed to immediately try to stop the riot , which could be seen as proof that he endorsed the mob .\nSellers said that the law didn \u2019 t require them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendants , and he pointed out that they had presented facts that alleged coordination between two right-wing groups named in one of the cases , the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys .\nMehta acknowledged that was true , but noted that the plaintiffs would likely be disappointed if he allowed the conspiracy claims against those groups to go forward but dismissed them against Trump .\nMehta is deeply familiar with the Justice Department \u2019 s theories so far on the role that members of the Oath Keepers played on Jan. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large conspiracy case that prosecutors have brought against members of the group ; charges are pending against 17 defendants , and four defendants have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government .\nThe Oath Keepers have a pending motion to dismiss the Democrats \u2019 civil lawsuit they \u2019 re named in , and Mehta is considering that as well .\nDuring an exchange with Binnall about the future of the conspiracy claim against Trump , Mehta asked about the fact that Trump didn \u2019 t tweet or put out other public statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack had begun .\nBinnall said that a president couldn \u2019 t be liable for not taking a certain action .\nThe judge countered that Trump \u2019 s public silence could support the idea that Trump understood he was part of an agreement to disrupt Congress \u2019 s activities on Jan. 6 .\nMehta also drew a comparison to a civil lawsuit against organizers of the \u201c Unite the Right \u201d rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , in 2017 that turned violent ; a jury last year found white nationalist Richard Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racially motivated violence .\nMehta on Monday also considered whether claims lodged against Donald Trump Jr. and Giuliani , who were named as defendants in Swalwell \u2019 s case , could go forward .\nMehta suggested there wasn \u2019 t as much of a record of Trump Jr. making public calls to action to the same extent as his father , and referenced public reports that Trump Jr. had messaged Trump \u2019 s chief of staff at the time , Mark Meadows , to try to get Trump to stop the mob .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mehta heard arguments on defendant Republican Rep. Mo Brooks \u2019 effort to have the US government step into the case on his behalf , based on the argument that he was acting in his official capacity when he spoke at the Jan. 6 rally .\nThe Justice Department has opposed stepping in on his behalf .",

        "content": "A cadre of prominent voting rights organizations working on the ground in Georgia is boycotting President Joe Biden \u2019 s voting rights speech in the state Tuesday , protesting the slow progress on two landmark bills that have stalled in the Senate .\n\u201c What we 're saying is we do n't need another speech .\nWhat we need is actually a plan , \u201d said Cliff Albright , executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund , on a call with reporters .\n\u201c What we need is for him to lean into the filibuster and do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a clear call for it to be modified , not just telling us what he 's open to , and not just telling us when he could possibly support if it 's necessary , but to have a full-throated call for changing the filibuster in order to pass voting rights.\n\u201d Biden plans to travel to Georgia with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday , where both are slated to give speeches on the importance of voting rights legislation .\nThere \u2019 s been little movement on Capitol Hill \u2014 despite Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate to vote on measures that would lay the groundwork to pass the voting rights legislation before Jan. 17 .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bThere is not time during these fights to attend a speech and meet to reiterate the seriousness of this moment , \u201d the groups said in a statement a day before Biden and Harris 's trip to Georgia .\nThe statement was signed by the New Georgia Project Action Fund , the Black Voters Matter Action Fund , the Asian American Advocacy Fund , the GALEO Impact Fund , and James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia NAACP .\nAsked about the groups \u2019 calls for Biden to stay in DC and work on passing legislation rather than traveling to Georgia for the speech , White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated that the president would prefer to pass voting rights legislation with the support of a majority of the Senate .\n\u201c His plan is to sign voting rights legislation into law , \u201d Psaki told reporters during a Monday press briefing .\n\u201c That requires a majority of senators to support it even if there are changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something the president has expressed an openness to.\n\u201d The voting rights groups \u2019 announcement to skip the president \u2019 s speech comes as they have grown frustrated that Senate procedure has stalled the bills .\nSenate Democrats support both bills but face a steep hurdle in the evenly divided chamber , where it takes 60 votes to pass legislation .\nDemocrats have called for reforms to the procedure , which would require 51 votes , but Sens .\nJoe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have each voiced opposition to any carve-outs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us that this was n't item number one on the agenda as soon as the president was inaugurated , \u201d said Kendra Davenport Cotton , chief operating officer of the New Georgia Project .\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell aggressively used the filibuster to kill legislation during the Obama and Trump administrations and has consistently warned Democrats against changing the rules .\nAt the same time , 19 restrictive voting laws were passed in 2021 by Republicans on the state and local levels across the country , propelled by conspiracy theories denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the past year , Georgia Republicans have passed several of those restrictive bills ; the legislation at stake in the Senate would prevent those bills from taking effect , requiring states not to impose unreasonable voter ID and access laws and implementing national standards for how elections are run .\n\u201c We think it sets a serious precedent that at the end of the day , when there are people that are coming after your base of voters , right , and you 're stringing it out , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Georgia-based advocate and cofounder of Black Voters Matter .\nShe added , \u201c How is it that now , myself , as a Black woman \u2014 I actually have less protection now than I did a year ago ?\n\u201d Biden previously called on the Senate to return to a rule that would require senators to continuously speak on the floor to delay a bill from passing .\nBut advocates on the call said that the president needs to more forcefully back changing the filibuster rules .\nThe two bills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US .\nThe Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail , ban gerrymandering , and set national standards for elections .\nThe John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reinforce portions of the Voting Rights Act , which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade , by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters .\nAlbright said the groups would only be satisfied if Biden and Harris arrive in Georgia tomorrow to announce an actual agreement on voting rights \u2014 with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything short of that would be disappointing and not worth the trip to Georgia , \u201c he said .\n\u201c But the bare , bare minimum would be , as we have all said , a full-throated call for modifying the filibuster rules.\n\u201d Some advocates want Biden to more firmly back Schumer \u2019 s call to hold a vote before Jan. 17 on carving out a voting rights exception to the filibuster .\n\u201c We need Biden to demand that that vote happens this week , \u201d Woodall said .\nHe wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out directly \u201d for holding up the legislation .\nRep. Nikema Williams of Georgia said she will attend the president 's and vice president 's speeches because she sees it as an opportunity to ground the push for the voting rights legislation in `` the cradle of the civil rights movement . ''\n`` I represent a district that was once held by Congressman John Lewis , '' she said .\n`` And I am going because it 's imperative to me that the White House , specifically the president and the vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full weight of the White House behind creating a path forward with the filibuster to get voting rights passed . ''\nOne major national civil rights group , the NAACP , did not join the local groups \u2019 denunciation of the president \u2019 s visit \u2014 rather , its members will be watching closely in the days after the address for the president to push changes to the filibuster and then the voting rights bills , NAACP President Derrick Johnson told BuzzFeed News .\nJohnson said he \u2019 s seen the administration \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like COVID relief , the debt ceiling raise , the infrastructure bill , and unemployment tax .\n\u201c Placing the priority on the policy issues is n't about words , it is about outcomes .\nAnd we have yet to have an outcome of voting rights protections over a year , \u201d he said .\nHe said he does understand Georgia civil rights groups not supporting Biden \u2019 s visit .\n\u201c What they \u2019 re expressing is their frustration knowing how important this is , '' he said .\n\u201c So as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 ll be watching the following days.\n\u201d As far as he \u2019 s concerned , though , \u201c how to get there is irrelevant as long as they get there .\n\u201d",

the legislation at stake in the Senate would prevent those bills from taking effect , requiring states not to impose unreasonable voter ID and access laws and implementing national standards for how elections are run .\n\u201c We think it sets a serious precedent that at the end of the day , when there are people that are coming after your base of voters , right , and you 're stringing it out , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Georgia-based advocate and cofounder of Black Voters Matter .\nShe added , \u201c How is it that now , myself , as a Black woman \u2014 I actually have less protection now than I did a year ago ?\n\u201d Biden previously called on the Senate to return to a rule that would require senators to continuously speak on the floor to delay a bill from passing .\nBut advocates on the call said that the president needs to more forcefully back changing the filibuster rules .\nThe two bills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US .\nThe Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail , ban gerrymandering , and set national standards for elections .\nThe John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reinforce portions of the Voting Rights Act , which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade , by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters .\nAlbright said the groups would only be satisfied if Biden and Harris arrive in Georgia tomorrow to announce an actual agreement on voting rights \u2014 with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything short of that would be disappointing and not worth the trip to Georgia , \u201c he said .\n\u201c But the bare , bare minimum would be , as we have all said , a full-throated call for modifying the filibuster rules.\n\u201d Some advocates want Biden to more firmly back Schumer \u2019 s call to hold a vote before Jan. 17 on carving out a voting rights exception to the filibuster .\n\u201c We need Biden to demand that that vote happens this week , \u201d Woodall said .\nHe wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out directly \u201d for holding up the legislation .\nRep. Nikema Williams of Georgia said she will attend the president 's and vice president 's speeches because she sees it as an opportunity to ground the push for the voting rights legislation in `` the cradle of the civil rights movement . ''\n`` I represent a district that was once held by Congressman John Lewis , '' she said .\n`` And I am going because it 's imperative to me that the White House , specifically the president and the vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full weight of the White House behind creating a path forward with the filibuster to get voting rights passed . ''\nOne major national civil rights group , the NAACP , did not join the local groups \u2019 denunciation of the president \u2019 s visit \u2014 rather , its members will be watching closely in the days after the address for the president to push changes to the filibuster and then the voting rights bills , NAACP President Derrick Johnson told BuzzFeed News .\nJohnson said he \u2019 s seen the administration \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like COVID relief , the debt ceiling raise , the infrastructure bill , and unemployment tax .\n\u201c Placing the priority on the policy issues is n't about words , it is about outcomes .\nAnd we have yet to have an outcome of voting rights protections over a year , \u201d he said .\nHe said he does understand Georgia civil rights groups not supporting Biden \u2019 s visit .\n\u201c What they \u2019 re expressing is their frustration knowing how important this is , '' he said .\n\u201c So as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 ll be watching the following days.\n\u201d As far as he \u2019 s concerned , though , \u201c how to get there is irrelevant as long as they get there .\n\u201d",

        "content": "The cruel irony is that what appears to be the mildest widespread variant of the coronavirus is the one that risks pushing the US hospital system to the brink .\nIn Chicago , patients are being treated in hospital hallways and in office chairs .\nIn Farmington , New Mexico , military reinforcements have been deployed in civilian hospitals from over 700 miles away in San Diego .\nAnd in Paterson , New Jersey , nonemergency surgeries have been canceled .\nA gallbladder condition that might typically require removal ?\nTry antibiotics first .\nA bone fracture for which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let \u2019 s put you in a cast and crutches for a bit to see how you fare .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t really have to invoke crisis standards of care to be delivering crisis standards of care , \u201d said Anand Swaminathan , assistant professor of emergency medicine at Paterson \u2019 s St. Joseph 's University Medical Center .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an enormous challenge to render care to as many patients as we can right now.\n\u201d This is America in the Omicron wave .\nUS hospitals and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and challenging ways that are unlike previous surges in the pandemic , medical workers across the country told BuzzFeed News .\nPatients who might normally be admitted for observation are being sent home to keep beds available .\nOthers are waiting 10 hours or more in emergency rooms to be seen , before perhaps giving up and walking out altogether .\nReaching the breaking point is a deceptively slow process , but little by little Swaminathan said his hospital and others are losing the things they need to keep running effectively .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an armageddon .\nIt \u2019 s not going to happen all at once , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to be fairly silent , and people aren \u2019 t going to realize it until they call 911 and no one comes.\n\u201d As Omicron spreads , COVID cases are surging at record levels in all 50 states .\nBut given the relative mildness of the variant for most people , especially the vaccinated , Anthony Fauci and others have said it is now more relevant to pay closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers .\nYet , that too is alarming .\nMore than 147,000 people are currently in US hospitals with COVID \u2014 more than at any point in the pandemic to date .\nCDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that the seven-day average of hospital admissions had risen 33 % over the prior week to about 19,800 per day .\nImportantly , those figures include people with an incidental case of COVID , meaning they came to be treated for something else and were found to also be positive for the virus .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be deceiving .\nCOVID may be exacerbating some people \u2019 s underlying health issues and , crucially , the net effect on hospitals is the same : more patients taking up more beds and requiring special isolation and safety protocols so as not to infect others .\nWhile new studies are showing Omicron is less severe and requires hospital stays about 70 % shorter than Delta on average , the incredibly transmissible variant is still spreading like wildfire , including among children , who are being admitted to hospitals with COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospitalization remains low , especially among people who are up to date on their COVID vaccines , \u201d Walensky said Wednesday .\n\u201c However , the staggering rise in cases \u2014 over 1 million new cases each day \u2014 has led to a high number of total hospitalizations.\n\u201d All this while more and more medical workers are themselves testing positive and being forced to the sidelines , leaving their colleagues \u2014 at least , those who haven \u2019 t left the profession altogether due to burnout \u2014 straining to treat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency rooms with COVID , yes , but also for any other medical condition or traumatic injury .\nThe cruel irony , then , is that what appears to be the mildest widespread variant of the coronavirus is the one that risks toppling the US hospital system .\n\u201c Before this if you had an acute life- or limb-threatening medical issue and you went to an emergency department in America , you would have a promise that it would be quickly taken care of , \u201d said Gabe Gao , an ER physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedford , Massachusetts .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think we can keep that promise right now.\n\u201d Not every hospital is currently facing a crunch .\nSome that previously experienced huge waves are holding steady \u2014 for now .\n\u201c In the first wave , I had 400 patients with COVID , now we have 100 , \u201d said Aaron Glatt , chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau on Long Island , New York .\n\u201c We have better treatments , we have a better understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , two months ago I had 10 patients with COVID.\n\u201d Michael Daignault , an ER doctor at Providence St Joseph Medical Center in Burbank , California , said he was so shaken by the surge of cases in his area last winter that he felt the current moment was more manageable .\nBefore patients might stay for weeks or months at a time in the ICU , but now that tends to be different .\n\u201c The majority of patients that are getting admitted have less severe illness .\nThe average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a quicker turnover .\nWe \u2019 re able to handle it.\n\u201d But both Daignault and Glatt said they had still experienced staffing shortages , with hospital workers out sick from the virus .\nThey also noted they live in states with relatively high vaccination rates .\nNew York , for example , has almost 20 % more people fully vaccinated than in Missouri , where total hospitalizations are now above their worst previous levels .\n\u201c Missouri \u2019 s hospitals are slammed , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Hospitals are delaying non-emergent care , boarding patients of all kinds in emergency departments for a lack of bed space , and experiencing significant workforce challenges.\n\u201d \u201c Not sure what else to tell you .\nThese are very difficult times , \u201d he said .\nIn Idaho , the state with the lowest vaccination rate where less than half the population is fully vaccinated , the Omicron surge could be disastrous .\nMany hospitals there have only recently pulled themselves out of crisis standards of care following an overwhelming surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keller , the CEO of the Idaho Medical Association , said her members have barely caught their breath from that trauma and are now staring down the likely prospect of another wave .\n\u201c They just feel completely besieged , \u201d Keller said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s another thing on top of everything else.\n\u201d Keller implored those in her state who have not received a vaccine to do so , lest they take up a hospital bed that could go to another person who has had their shots and comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to discover medical assistance is in short supply .\n\u201c It \u2019 s absolutely unfair , and it \u2019 s a very sad situation , \u201d she said .\n\u201c My heart truly goes out to those folks who are trying to do the right thing and for circumstances beyond their control end up in a hospital where the resources aren \u2019 t there.\n\u201d There are signs that some places hit early by Omicron have seen the worst of their spike in infections , although hospitalizations have previously tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut other states are still yet to reach their Omicron peak , including Arizona , where in a press briefing on Tuesday , Marjorie Bessel , the chief clinical officer at the Phoenix-headquartered Banner Health , which employs over 50,000 people across the American West , pleaded with people to be patient with staff in the days and weeks ahead .\nMore employees are calling out sick , she said , meaning patients are experiencing longer waits than normal .\n\u201c We are busy in our clinics , we are busy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our emergency departments , and we are busy in our hospitals , \u201d Bessel said .\n\u201c We also understand that we are not yet at the peak of the Omicron variant.\n\u201d In an effort to reduce the total number of medical staff out sick at any one point , the CDC announced just before Christmas that asymptomatic medical workers could return to work after seven days , instead of 10 , if they test negative .\nMedical staff who have received their booster shots also now no longer need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One ER physician

        "content": "President Joe Biden speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus on Jan. 13 , 2022 .\nPresident Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms , in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country .\n\u201c Like every other major civil rights bill that came along , if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one , '' he said .\n`` We missed this time .\nWe missed this time.\n\u201d After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground there \u2014 Biden visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules , which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills .\nBut after his meeting with senators , the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules \u2014 and passing the voting rights package \u2014 are not looking likely .\n\u201c I hope we can get this done , but the honest to god answer is I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this done , \u201d Biden said .\nNormally a bill requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate .\nDemocrats have only a 50\u201350 majority , including the tiebreaker , and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority .\nAt least two Democratic senators , Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia , oppose this plan , dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need .\nSinema gave a speech Thursday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not changing the Senate rules to pass them .\nShe said nuking the filibuster would contribute to the \u201c disease of division \u201d that has broken American politics .\nDemocrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway , knowing they don \u2019 t have the numbers .\nIt \u2019 s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose , but Democrats say this issue is unique .\n\u201c I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou \u2019 re either for democracy or you \u2019 re not , \u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to have , frankly , every one of us on the record.\n\u201d Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats \u2019 doomed push .\n\u201c It makes perfect political sense , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re Joe Biden , you \u2019 ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power .\nIf you \u2019 re Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the question or you \u2019 re going to get a primary .\nIf you \u2019 re in a purple or a red state , it \u2019 s probably good politics for you .\nSo this is perfectly good politics for both sides.\n\u201d The voting rights package , named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis , would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions , create nationwide minimum early voting day standards , make Election Day a federal holiday , and allow the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state passes restrictions that target minority groups .\nLast year , Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states that make voting more restrictive .\nVoting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia , where several of those bills were enacted , boycotted Biden \u2019 s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday , instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures .\nSeveral of those leaders , from groups including Black Voters Matter , the New Georgia Project , and Asian Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after the speech so that Georgia .\nSeemingly in response to that criticism , in an email to those leaders on Wednesday , the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday \u201c to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation \u201d before thanking them for their \u201c work and advocacy on this issue.\n\u201d On Thursday , two of the Georgia voting rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even if the bills don \u2019 t have a chance of passing right now .\n\u201c Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand , \u201d said James Woodall , former president of the Georgia NAACP .\n\u201c We have no luxury of , or privilege of , delaying this any longer .\nAnd so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Georgia Project , said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and Manchin to make headway .\n\u201c He needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want , '' Ufot said .\n`` I \u2019 m not in a position to figure that out , but he can , so I think that feels like a next step . ''\nUfot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority .\n\u201c We care deeply about this issue , because fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our families , we care about our communities , and that does n't go away , \u201d Ufot said .\n\u201c We 're not going anywhere .\nAnd we 're never going to shut up about this .\n\u201d",

        "content": "A protester holds a sign that reads `` Freedom Is One Generation From Extinction '' as he walks by the Supreme Court on Jan. 7 , 2022 , as justices heard arguments against the vaccine mandates .\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday blocked a Biden administration rule that required US companies with 100 employees or more to mandate that their staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to weekly testing .\nBut the court also narrowly upheld a vaccine mandate for healthcare workers at facilities that receive federal funding .\nBy blocking the mandate for private companies , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the court dealt a significant blow to the White House 's efforts to curtail the pandemic at a time when hospitalizations have surged nationwide due to the spread of the Omicron variant .\n`` I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law , '' President Joe Biden said in a statement .\nIn an opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh , six members of the court granted a request from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from enforcing the private employer rule for now .\nThe majority of justices said the NFIB was likely to succeed in court by arguing Biden 's labor secretary lacked authority to impose the mandate .\nThey said the law that established OSHA `` empowers the Secretary to set workplace safety standards , not broad public health measures . ''\n`` Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers , it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans , selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees , certainly falls in the latter category . ''\nThe court 's three liberal members \u2014 justices Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor , and Elena Kagan \u2014 said in a dissenting opinion that they would have allowed the mandate to be enforced , calling COVID-19 a `` menace in work settings .

        "content": "Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 others associated with the armed extremist group with seditious conspiracy , the first such charge to come out of the sprawling investigation of the Capitol insurrection begun just over a year ago .\nRhodes , 56 , was arrested Thursday morning in Little Elm , Texas , about 35 miles north of Dallas .\nA second man , Edward Vallejo , 63 , was arrested in Phoenix , according to the Department of Justice .\nThe other nine defendants have all previously been charged in the Oath Keepers conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal court .\nAccording to the indictment , which was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday and sealed until the following day , Rhodes conspired \u201c to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power \u201d by stopping Congress \u2019 certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 .\nHe and the other defendants , prosecutors claim , \u201c coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington , DC , equipped themselves with a variety of weapons , donned combat and tactical gear , and were prepared to answer Rhodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rhodes \u2019 s direction.\n\u201d Kellye SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 general counsel , confirmed Rhodes \u2019 arrest and said she is working to find a criminal defense attorney to represent him .\nShe called the arrest \u201c all part of the show \u201d and said he did not have enough funds to hire representation .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol , the acting US attorney in Washington , DC , at the time , Michael Sherwin , announced that a task force had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with Jan. 6 , including seditious conspiracy .\nBut although more than 725 people have since been charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies for their involvement in the events of Jan. 6 , a number of whom are facing conspiracy charges related to obstructing Congress \u2019 s attempts to certify the Electoral College , none has previously been charged with crimes related to sedition \u2014 which amounts to inciting a rebellion against the government .\nThe charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment involving members of a militant group , and a judge ended up acquitting the defendants of the sedition count two years later .\nRhodes , whose first name is Elmer , but who goes by his middle name , founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 .\nKnown for the distinctive patch he wears to cover up an eye he lost from an accidental self-inflicted gun wound , he is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School who was later disbarred from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former member of Congress Ron Paul and rose to prominence as a frequent guest on Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars program , as well as for leading his Oath Keepers membership into a series of charged political events including the 2014 standoff between cattle ranchers and federal law enforcement in southern Nevada known as the Bundy standoff .\nRhodes , originally from Nevada , lived for years in Montana , but after separating from his wife in 2018 has lived an itinerant life .\nHe settled most recently in Granbury , Texas , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is based .\nA longtime libertarian and critic of political figures on both sides of the aisle , Rhodes became became more closely aligned with former president Donald Trump in the lead up to and wake of the 2020 election , casting doubt on the results of the election and calling on Oath Keepers to attend protests and gather in Washington on Jan. 6 .\nThe original conspiracy case filed against members of the Oath Keepers in late January 2021 has grown to nearly two dozen defendants , and in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their activities , referring to him as `` Person One '' in court filings .\nNine of the 17 defendants in that case were also charged with seditious conspiracy in the new indictment .\nAccording to the 48-page , 17-count indictment , Rhodes began preparations for an apparent rebellion on Nov. 5 , 2020 , just two days after the presidential election , when he invited other Oath Keeper members into a leadership chat on the messaging platform Signal .\n\u201c We aren \u2019 t getting through this without a civil war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Too late for that .\nPrepare your mind , body , spirit.\n\u201d Over the following weeks and months , prosecutors allege , Rhodes employed increasingly fiery language to encourage Oath Keeper membership to prepare for conflict and , ultimately , to travel to Washington .\n\u201c It will be a bloody and desperate fight , \u201d he wrote on Signal on Dec. 11 .\n\u201c We are going to have to fight .\nThat can \u2019 t be avoided.\n\u201d Between Dec. 30 and Jan. 2 , Rhodes bought some $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a shotgun , night vision goggles , and large amounts of ammunition , the indictment alleges .\nOn Jan. 3 , he departed Granbury , Texas \u2014 where he has been residing since he left his longtime home in Montana \u2014 for Washington , stopping twice en route to spend an additional $ 10,500 on an AR-15 platform rifle , scopes , more ammo , and other accessories .\nAnd in the two weeks after Jan. 6 , he spent an additional $ 17,500 on such items .\nIt \u2019 s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington .\nThe indictment details his work to help coordinate a so-called Quick Reaction Force , or QRF , composed of Oath Keepers members and associates from Florida , North Carolina , and Arizona who stowed their weapons in a Comfort Inn in Ballston , Virginia .\nOne of those individuals , according to the indictment , was Vallejo , a member of the Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona and a self-described \u201c activist \u201d who served as an alternative delegate for the state \u2019 s Republican Party and attended the 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to another Oath Keeper member on Jan. 4 , he referred to the Comfort Inn as the \u201c allied encampment \u201d and , appearing on a podcast early on Jan. 6 , he discussed the possibility of \u201c guerilla war , \u201d noting \u201c there are people who are prepared , have the will , have the facilities to do more than taunt.\n\u201d Although Rhodes is not accused of entering the Capitol , prosecutors now say he entered \u201c restricted grounds \u201d on Jan. 6 by standing outside the building while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail how he directed the movements of people who ended up penetrating the complex .\nAmid the chaos , Rhodes reacted to incoming messages claiming it was Antifa that had pushed past the US Capitol Police .\nLater that night , the charging document claims , Rhodes joined several other Oath Keepers celebrating the day \u2019 s events at a restaurant in Vienna , Virginia .\nAmid the festivities , he sent out an encrypted message : \u201c Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the encrypted nature of the Signal chats Rhodes engaged in , it \u2019 s not clear how prosecutors were able to gather their evidence .\nFederal agents seized Rhodes \u2019 phone last May , and he sat for an interview with the FBI in July .\nIn September , the government also used a search warrant to seize attorney SoRelle \u2019 s phone .\nThat warrant identified \u201c seditious conspiracy \u201d as a possible crime being investigated .\nMeanwhile , four other alleged Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones with investigators .\nAlthough little has been heard from those people , last month , prosecutors said they were continuing to help the government .\nThe new indictment effectively splits the Oath Keepers defendants into separate cases .\nThe original case , which charges conspiracy to interfere with Congress \u2019 activities but not seditious conspiracy , is slimmed down to seven defendants .\nRhodes , meanwhile , faces the sedition-related charge , along with the other conspiracy count , alongside Kelly Meggs , Kenneth Harrelson , Jessica Watkins , Joshua James , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moerschel , Brian Ulrich , and Thomas Caldwell .\nRhodes was also hit with an obstruction charge for deleting records from his phone , an allegation they also apply to seven of the other defendants .\nProsecutors have also secured a separate new indictment against a previous Oath Keepers defendant , Jonathan Walden , who is charged with obstructing Congress and illegally being at the Capitol , but does not face any conspiracy allegation .\nIt was not immediately clear what impact the new charges will have on the court \u2019 s schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Amit Mehta rejected efforts by the defendants in the Oath Keepers case to get the conspiracy charges tossed out .\nThe judge had planned to begin trial on one group of Oath Keepers in April , with a possible second trial in July .\nIt now seems likely that the first trial date will no longer be at play .\nUnlike many of the charges brought against alleged Capitol rioters so far , which have focused on the physical criminal acts committed that day \u2014 such as assaulting police , disrupting Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and simply illegally being in the Capitol \u2014 sedition deals with a person \u2019 s intent to go against the US government .\nThe felony offense makes it a crime to \u201c conspire to overthrow , put down , or to destroy by force the Government of the United States , or to levy war against them , or to oppose by force the authority thereof , or by force to prevent , hinder , or delay the execution of any law of the United States , or by force to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States.\n\u201d In a public address last week marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack , Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled that people who hadn \u2019 t gone into the Capitol could still face prosecution for any involvement in the insurrection .\n\u201c The Justice Department remains committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators , at any level , accountable under law , \u201d he said , \u201c whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.\n\u201d The Oath Keepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a point of focus for the select congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 .\nIn November , the committee subpoenaed Rhodes to provide documents and a deposition , citing \u201c credible evidence of \u201d his involvement in the Capitol insurrection .\nAccording to SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 attorney , Rhodes has not yet appeared before the committee and was negotiating terms to respond to the subpoena .\n\u201c I am incredibly relieved , \u201d said Tasha Adams , who filed for divorce from Rhodes in early 2018 , claiming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and their children .\n\u201c I feel like I just set down a heavy weight that I have been carrying .\nThe weight of constant fear , of always looking over my shoulder to make sure my kids are safe .\n\u201d",

forced labor is rampant .\nBut these button-downs \u2014 along with dozens of other clothing shipments brought into the United States within the last year by Hugo Boss , Tommy Hilfiger , and other clothing brands \u2014 were produced by a large Chinese company called Esquel Group .\nAnd that \u2019 s a red flag .\nOn a balmy day in March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docked in Savannah , Georgia .\nOn board was a shipment of button-down shirts made of \u201c peached cotton , \u201d a fuzzy fabric meant to feel as soft as the skin of the fruit .\nEmbroidered on their pockets was the Hugo Boss logo .\nForced labor is so pervasive in China 's far west region of Xinjiang \u2014 and government control over information is so absolute \u2014 that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there .\nBut here \u2019 s what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US government placed trade restrictions on one of its Xinjiang subsidiaries , Changji Esquel Textile Co. , citing concerns over forced labor .\n\u2022 None In January 2021 , US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US , again citing forced labor .\nSince the cotton ban , a different Esquel subsidiary located in Guangdong \u2014 hundreds of miles away from Xinjiang \u2014 has continued exporting its clothes to brands in the US .\nBut procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton spinning factories .\nWhen asked repeatedly , neither Hugo Boss nor Tommy Hilfiger nor Ralph Lauren would say where the cotton in their Esquel shipments comes from .\nEsquel \u2019 s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation .\nThe company describes itself as \u201c vertically integrated , \u201d meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain : Esquel \u2019 s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds , and those fibers are later spun into yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esquel \u2019 s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth , then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong\u2013based Esquel Enterprises .\nThe company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang , where the bulk of China \u2019 s cotton is grown \u2014 but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region .\nSince the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January , at least 16 Esquel shipments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trade records show , the latest one in mid-December .\nOne shipment has arrived addressed to PVH , the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger , containing Tommy Hilfiger\u2013branded goods ; four for Ralph Lauren ; and one for Polo , a Ralph Lauren subsidiary .\nGuangdong Esquel , along with other Esquel companies , is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss \u2019 s most recently published supplier list .\nPVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list , as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News reached out for comment \u2014 PVH released an updated version of its list , and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it .\nNo Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren \u2019 s latest list , which was published in November .\nHugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel , and the company had replied that \u201c all our specifications and standards , including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions , have been and are being complied with.\n\u201d Hugo Boss also said its own audits at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of forced labor .\nPVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment .\nIn response to a list of questions , Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor .\nIt added that it follows all national import and export laws , and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions .\nAsked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang , Esquel did not give any specifics , saying only that it sources from \u201c most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable .\n\u201c Cotton is grown in Xinjiang , but then it is sold to warehouses , processors , and suppliers all over China , \u201d said Laura Murphy , professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University , who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang .\nAnd then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Every time it moves , its provenance is increasingly obscured .\nThere are many ways to track it , but so far most companies don \u2019 t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.\n\u201d A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law , importers must take \u201c reasonable care \u201d in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor .\nAsked what constitutes \u201c reasonable care , \u201d the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to \u201c become familiar with applicable laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency to protect consumers from \u201c harmful and counterfeit imports.\n\u201d As part of its campaign targeting Muslims , the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories .\nThe US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government , including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics .\nThe US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time : The US banned cotton and tomato imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor , placing the burden of proof on importers .\nThe region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies .\nChina is currently the world

        "content": "President Joe Biden speaks to the press after meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus on Jan. 13 , 2022 .\nPresident Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms , in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country .\n\u201c Like every other major civil rights bill that came along , if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one , '' he said .\n`` We missed this time .\nWe missed this time.\n\u201d After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground there \u2014 Biden visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules , which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills .\nBut after his meeting with senators , the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules \u2014 and passing the voting rights package \u2014 are not looking likely .\n\u201c I hope we can get this done , but the honest to god answer is I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this done , \u201d Biden said .\nNormally a bill requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate .\nDemocrats have only a 50\u201350 majority , including the tiebreaker , and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority .\nAt least two Democratic senators , Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia , oppose this plan , dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need .\nSinema gave a speech Thursday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not changing the Senate rules to pass them .\nShe said nuking the filibuster would contribute to the \u201c disease of division \u201d that has broken American politics .\nDemocrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway , knowing they don \u2019 t have the numbers .\nIt \u2019 s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose , but Democrats say this issue is unique .\n\u201c I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou \u2019 re either for democracy or you \u2019 re not , \u201d Sen. Martin Heinrich said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to have , frankly , every one of us on the record.\n\u201d Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats \u2019 doomed push .\n\u201c It makes perfect political sense , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re Joe Biden , you \u2019 ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power .\nIf you \u2019 re Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the question or you \u2019 re going to get a primary .\nIf you \u2019 re in a purple or a red state , it \u2019 s probably good politics for you .\nSo this is perfectly good politics for both sides.\n\u201d The voting rights package , named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis , would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions , create nationwide minimum early voting day standards , make Election Day a federal holiday , and allow the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state passes restrictions that target minority groups .\nLast year , Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states that make voting more restrictive .\nVoting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia , where several of those bills were enacted , boycotted Biden \u2019 s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday , instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures .\nSeveral of those leaders , from groups including Black Voters Matter , the New Georgia Project , and Asian Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after the speech so that Georgia .\nSeemingly in response to that criticism , in an email to those leaders on Wednesday , the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday \u201c to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation \u201d before thanking them for their \u201c work and advocacy on this issue.\n\u201d On Thursday , two of the Georgia voting rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even if the bills don \u2019 t have a chance of passing right now .\n\u201c Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand , \u201d said James Woodall , former president of the Georgia NAACP .\n\u201c We have no luxury of , or privilege of , delaying this any longer .\nAnd so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Georgia Project , said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and Manchin to make headway .\n\u201c He needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want , '' Ufot said .\n`` I \u2019 m not in a position to figure that out , but he can , so I think that feels like a next step . ''\nUfot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority .\n\u201c We care deeply about this issue , because fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our families , we care about our communities , and that does n't go away , \u201d Ufot said .\n\u201c We 're not going anywhere .\nAnd we 're never going to shut up about this .\n\u201d",

        "title": "The Founder Of The Oath Keepers Has Been Charged With Seditious Conspiracy",
        "content": "Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 others associated with the armed extremist group with seditious conspiracy , the first such charge to come out of the sprawling investigation of the Capitol insurrection since it began just over a year ago .\nRhodes , 56 , was arrested on Thursday shortly before noon local time in Little Elm , Texas , about 35 miles north of Dallas .\nA second man , Edward Vallejo , 63 , was arrested in Phoenix , according to the Department of Justice .\nThe other nine defendants have all previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case pending in Washington , DC , federal court .\nAccording to the indictment , which was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday and sealed until the following day , Rhodes conspired \u201c to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power \u201d by stopping Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 .\nHe and the other defendants , prosecutors claim , \u201c coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington , DC , equipped themselves with a variety of weapons , donned combat and tactical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodes \u2019 s call to take up arms at Rhodes \u2019 s direction.\n\u201d Attorney Jonathan Moseley , who represents another member of the Oath Keepers , said he was on the phone with Rhodes when the FBI called on the other line asking the group 's founder to come outside so he could be arrested .\nKellye SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 general counsel , said she is working to find a criminal defense attorney to represent Rhodes .\nShe called the arrest \u201c all part of the show \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire representation .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol , the acting US attorney in Washington , DC , at the time , Michael Sherwin , announced that a task force had been formed to explore more serious charges in connection with Jan. 6 , including seditious conspiracy .\nBut although more than 725 people have since been charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies for their involvement in the events of Jan. 6 , a number of whom are facing conspiracy charges related to obstructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral College , none has previously been charged with crimes related to sedition \u2014 which amounts to inciting a rebellion against the government .\nThe charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison .\nIt \u2019 s a rarely charged offense .\nFederal prosecutors last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment involving members of a militant group , and a judge ended up acquitting the defendants of the sedition count two years later .\nRhodes , whose first name is Elmer but who goes by his middle name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Known for the distinctive patch he wears to cover up an eye he lost from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound , he is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School who was later disbarred from practicing law .\nHe worked briefly for former member of Congress Ron Paul and rose to prominence as a frequent guest on Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars program , as well as for leading the Oath Keepers members into a series of charged political events , including the 2014 confrontation between cattle ranchers and federal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy standoff .\nRhodes , originally from Nevada , lived for years in Montana , but since separating from his wife in 2018 has lived an itinerant life .\nHe settled most recently in Granbury , Texas , where SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 attorney , is based .\nA longtime libertarian and critic of political figures on both sides of the aisle , Rhodes became more closely aligned with former president Donald Trump in the lead-up to and wake of the 2020 election , casting doubt on the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oath Keepers to attend protests and gather in Washington on Jan. 6 .\nThe original conspiracy case filed against members of the Oath Keepers in late January 2021 has grown to nearly two dozen defendants .\nIn the process , it has danced around Rhodes ' involvement in their activities , referring to him as `` Person One '' in court filings .\nNine of the 17 defendants in that case were also charged with seditious conspiracy in the new indictment .\nAccording to the 48-page , 17-count indictment , Rhodes began preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2020 , just two days after the presidential election , when he invited other Oath Keeper members to a leadership chat on the messaging platform Signal .\n\u201c We aren \u2019 t getting through this without a civil war , \u201d Rhodes wrote at the time .\n\u201c Too late for that .\nPrepare your mind , body , spirit.\n\u201d Over the following weeks and months , prosecutors allege , he employed increasingly fiery language to encourage the group 's members to prepare for conflict and , ultimately , to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloody and desperate fight , \u201d he wrote on Signal on Dec. 11 .\n\u201c We are going to have to fight .\nThat can \u2019 t be avoided.\n\u201d Between Dec. 30 and Jan. 2 , Rhodes bought some $ 12,000 worth of firearms and accessories , including a shotgun , night vision goggles , and large amounts of ammunition , the indictment alleges .\nOn Jan. 3 , he departed Granbury , Texas , for Washington , stopping twice en route to spend an additional $ 10,500 on an AR-15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other accessories .\nAnd in the two weeks after Jan. 6 , he spent an additional $ 17,500 on such items .\nIt \u2019 s not clear where Rhodes stored such items while in Washington .\nThe indictment details his work to help coordinate a so-called Quick Reaction Force , or QRF , composed of members of the Oath Keepers and associates from Florida , North Carolina , and Arizona who stowed their weapons in a Comfort Inn in Arlington , Virginia .\nOne of those individuals , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona and a self-described \u201c activist \u201d who served as an alternative delegate for the state \u2019 s Republican Party and attended the 2012 Republican National Convention .\nIn a message sent to another member of the Oath Keepers on Jan. 4 , he referred to the Comfort Inn as the \u201c allied encampment.\n\u201d Appearing on a podcast early on Jan. 6 , he discussed the possibility of \u201c guerilla war , \u201d noting \u201c there are people who are prepared , have the will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunt.\n\u201d Although Rhodes is not accused of entering the Capitol , prosecutors now say he entered \u201c restricted grounds \u201d on Jan. 6 by standing outside the building while it was being stormed , and they detail how he directed the movements of people who ended up penetrating the complex .\nAmid the chaos , Rhodes reacted to incoming messages that were claiming members of antifa were pushing past the Capitol Police .\nLater that night , the charging document claims , Rhodes joined several other members of the Oath Keepers celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant in Vienna , Virginia .\nAmid the festivities , he sent out an encrypted message : \u201c Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared to what \u2019 s coming.\n\u201d Given the encrypted nature of the Signal chats Rhodes engaged in , it \u2019 s not clear how prosecutors were able to gather their evidence .\nFederal agents seized Rhodes \u2019 phone last May , and he sat for an interview with the FBI in July .\nIn September , the government also used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s phone .\nThat warrant identified \u201c seditious conspiracy \u201d as a possible crime being investigated .\nMeanwhile , four other alleged members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department , presumably sharing their phones with investigators .\nAlthough little has been heard from those people , last month , prosecutors said they were continuing to help the government .\nThe new indictment effectively splits the Oath Keepers defendants into separate cases .\nThe original case , which charges conspiracy to interfere with Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is slimmed down to seven defendants .\nRhodes , meanwhile , faces the sedition-related charge , along with the other conspiracy count , alongside Kelly Meggs , Kenneth Harrelson , Jessica Watkins , Joshua James , Roberto Minuta , Joseph Hackett , David Moerschel , Brian Ulrich , and Thomas Caldwell .\nRhodes and seven of the other defendants were also charged with obstruction for deleting electronic records in the wake of Jan. 6 .\nProsecutors have also secured a separate new indictment against a previous Oath Keepers defendant , Jonathan Walden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and illegally being at the Capitol , but he does not face any conspiracy allegation .\nIt was not immediately clear what impact the new charges will have on the court \u2019 s schedule .\nShortly before the holidays , US District Judge Amit Mehta rejected efforts by the defendants in the Oath Keepers case to get the conspiracy charges tossed out .\nThe judge had planned to begin trial on one group of Oath Keepers in April , with a possible second trial in July .\nIt now seems likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at play .\nUnlike many of the charges brought against alleged Capitol rioters so far , which have focused on the physical criminal acts committed that day \u2014 such as assaulting police , disrupting Congress \u2019 s certification of the election results , and simply illegally being in the Capitol \u2014 sedition deals with a person \u2019 s intent to go against the US government .\nThe felony offense makes it a crime to \u201c conspire to overthrow , put down , or to destroy by force the Government of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to oppose by force the authority thereof , or by force to prevent , hinder , or delay the execution of any law of the United States , or by force to seize , take , or possess any property of the United States.\n\u201d In a public address last week marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack , Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled that people who hadn \u2019 t gone into the Capitol could still face prosecution for any involvement in the insurrection .\n\u201c The Justice Department remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any level , accountable under law , \u201d he said , \u201c whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.\n\u201d The Oath Keepers , along with the Proud Boys , have been a point of focus for the select congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 .\nIn November , the committee subpoenaed Rhodes to provide documents and a deposition , citing \u201c credible evidence of \u201d his involvement in the Capitol insurrection .\nAccording to Moseley , Rhodes was scheduled to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attorney represents Kelly Meggs , one of the other members of the Oath Keepers who is now indicted for seditious conspiracy , and had hoped Rhodes could be a witness for his client in the case .\nAt the time the FBI called on Thursday , Moseley and Rhodes were discussing whether the group leader would answer the committee \u2019 s questions or invoke the Fifth Amendment , the lawyer said .\nIt took a few minutes for Rhodes to go outside , he added , because he was not yet dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly relieved , \u201d said Tasha Adams , who filed for divorce from Rhodes in early 2018 , claiming that he had been physically and emotionally abusive to her and their children .\n\u201c I feel like I just set down a heavy weight that I have been carrying .\nThe weight of constant fear , of always looking over my shoulder to make sure my kids are safe .\n\u201d",

Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections , Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said .\nBut in the 19th century , it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves , with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter .\nWith state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters , the standard of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over .\n\u201c You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots , \u201d Whittington said .\nTrump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms .\nHe is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022 , and a good number of the party \u2019 s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results .\nIn the Washington Post survey , nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states controlled mostly by Republicans .\nAsked about states controlled by mostly Democrats , that number shot up to 56 % .\nIt \u2019 s easiest to see how this could play out in the House , where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity .\nSay a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts .\nRepublicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022 , meaning the next speaker \u2014 perhaps current Minority Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to \u201c stop the steal \u201d in races across the country .\nHe \u2014 and the rest of the Republicans in Congress \u2014 would likely be flooded with calls demanding \u201c full forensic audits.\n\u201d For this scenario to play out , Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives .\nThat would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat \u2014 or not seat \u2014 any member in a contested race .\nDemocrats could challenge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority vote to uphold it .\nUsually there are more steps in the process .\nUnder the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969 , a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation , for which there are no real ground rules , according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Center .\nThe committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves .\nThey could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated .\nAnd they can make up whatever rules they \u2019 d like about which ballots to count and which not to count , regardless of state law .\nThe courts , historically , have stayed out of this ; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress \u201c shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members.\n\u201d The House doesn \u2019 t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process \u2014 any member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another member .\nIt \u2019 s even possible , though very unusual , for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter .\n\u201c The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like , \u201d Whittington said .\nUltimately , a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated .\nThe Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes .\nThough contested statewide elections are less frequent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with , the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race .\nNeither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now , but both suspect the other may do so .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t trust Republicans to play fair , period , \u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said .\n\u201c This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump , \u201d said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin , who sits on both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 6 .\n\u201c Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all .\nAnd then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they \u2019 re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.\n\u201d McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday , saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results .\nRepublicans point to Pelosi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees .\nThe Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they \u2019 d made .\nMcCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race , in 1985 , when then-speaker Tip O \u2019 Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own .\nIn what has become known as a fight over Indiana \u2019 s \u201c Bloody Eighth \u201d district , House Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors and claims of vote irregularities .\nRepublicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout .\n\u201c You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race , \u201d McCarthy said .\nPelosi openly considered using the House \u2019 s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes .\nAlthough the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks \u2019 win over Democrat Rita Hart , Hart appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart , but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge .\n\u201c If I wanted to be unfair , I wouldn \u2019 t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day .\nI would have just said , they \u2019 re not seated , and that would have been my right as speaker to do , \u201d Pelosi said at the time .\nRepublicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured .\nBut if the 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority hinges on only a seat or two ?\nThere could be chaos .\nMembers from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority , leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction .\nIt could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber .\nAs with much of the American political system , the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned .\nRepublican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld , but one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with retaliation .\nIf that happens with the majority in the balance , he said , \u201c Get your seat early .\nBring your popcorn.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "Now on sale for $ 82 , the shirts feature a slim fit , an embroidered placket , and a promise : Hugo Boss had not sourced its cotton from China \u2019 s Xinjiang region , where forced labor is rampant .\nBut these button-downs \u2014 along with dozens of other clothing shipments brought into the United States within the last year by Hugo Boss , Tommy Hilfiger , and other clothing brands \u2014 were produced by a large Chinese company called Esquel Group .\nAnd that \u2019 s a red flag .\nOn a balmy day in March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docked in Savannah , Georgia .\nOn board was a shipment of button-down shirts made of \u201c peached cotton , \u201d a fuzzy fabric meant to feel as soft as the skin of the fruit .\nEmbroidered on their pockets was the Hugo Boss logo .\nForced labor is so pervasive in China 's far west region of Xinjiang \u2014 and government control over information is so absolute \u2014 that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there .\nBut here \u2019 s what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US government placed trade restrictions on one of its Xinjiang subsidiaries , Changji Esquel Textile Co. , citing concerns over forced labor .\n\u2022 None In January 2021 , US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US , again citing forced labor .\nSince the cotton ban , a different Esquel subsidiary located in Guangdong \u2014 hundreds of miles away from Xinjiang \u2014 has continued exporting its clothes to brands in the US .\nBut procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton spinning factories .\nWhen asked repeatedly , neither Hugo Boss nor Tommy Hilfiger nor Ralph Lauren would say where the cotton in their Esquel shipments comes from .\nEsquel \u2019 s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation .\nThe company describes itself as \u201c vertically integrated , \u201d meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain : Esquel \u2019 s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds , and those fibers are later spun into yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esquel \u2019 s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth , then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong\u2013based Esquel Enterprises .\nThe company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang , where the bulk of China \u2019 s cotton is grown \u2014 but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region .\nSince the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January , at least 16 Esquel shipments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trade records show , the latest one in mid-December .\nOne shipment has arrived addressed to PVH , the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger , containing Tommy Hilfiger\u2013branded goods ; four for Ralph Lauren ; and one for Polo , a Ralph Lauren subsidiary .\nGuangdong Esquel , along with other Esquel companies , is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss \u2019 s most recently published supplier list .\nPVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list , as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News reached out for comment \u2014 PVH released an updated version of its list , and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it .\nNo Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren \u2019 s latest list , which was published in November .\nHugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel , and the company had replied that \u201c all our specifications and standards , including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions , have been and are being complied with.\n\u201d Hugo Boss also said its own audits at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of forced labor .\nPVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment .\nIn response to a list of questions , Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor .\nIt added that it follows all national import and export laws , and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions .\nAsked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang , Esquel did not give any specifics , saying only that it sources from \u201c most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable .\n\u201c Cotton is grown in Xinjiang , but then it is sold to warehouses , processors , and suppliers all over China , \u201d said Laura Murphy , professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University , who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang .\nAnd then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Every time it moves , its provenance is increasingly obscured .\nThere are many ways to track it , but so far most companies don \u2019 t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.\n\u201d A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law , importers must take \u201c reasonable care \u201d in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor .\nAsked what constitutes \u201c reasonable care , \u201d the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to \u201c become familiar with applicable laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency to protect consumers from \u201c harmful and counterfeit imports.\n\u201d As part of its campaign targeting Muslims , the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories .\nThe US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government , including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics .\nThe US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time : The US banned cotton and tomato imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor , placing the burden of proof on importers .\nThe region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies .\nChina is currently the world \u2019 s leading producer of cotton , with over 87 % of that coming from Xinjiang .\nResearch shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work \u2014 there is also evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xinjiang .\nThe Xinjiang cotton ban has become a flashpoint in the larger diplomatic row between the US and China , with the Chinese government , along with Chinese consumers and celebrities , pressuring international clothing brands to continue sourcing in the region as a show of patriotic support .\nHuman rights groups welcomed the ban but were skeptical it could be fully enforced .\nThey say forced labor by Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups , underpinned by government programs , is so widespread in Xinjiang that it \u2019 s nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure their suppliers don \u2019 t use it .\nThe political sensitivity of the issue , combined with the government \u2019 s other repressive measures targeting minority groups , has made it even more difficult for foreign companies to audit their supply chains .\nThe Better Cotton Initiative , an industry group that promotes sustainability by auditing its supply chains , stopped its reviews in Xinjiang altogether in October 2020 , citing \u201c an increasingly untenable operating environment.\n\u201d Five firms did the same .\nEsquel is the world \u2019 s largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major brands with more than 100 million every year , earning the company more than $ 1.3 billion in yearly revenue .\nEsquel operates two cotton ginning mills in Xinjiang and three spinning mills , where cotton is spun into yarn .\nBuzzFeed News was able to geolocate the three spinning mills in Xinjiang and the garment factories in Guangdong , matching images of these facilities on Esquel \u2019 s website with satellite imagery and street-level imagery from Baidu Total View and confirming their locations .\nThe book Esquel produced to celebrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its spinning mill in Xinjiang \u2019 s Turpan prefecture was established specifically to supply the Guangdong factories .\nBy 2018 , the book adds , Esquel \u2019 s investment in Xinjiang amounted to $ 100 million , including charitable donations .\nThe company did not answer a question about whether that supply route has changed .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election .\nAny candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump \u2019 s playbook for challenging a lost election , which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out .\nAnd they would have a major advantage over the former president : Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple .\nThere \u2019 s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politicians in either chamber .\nThe House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership .\nAnd the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question , as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year .\nAll that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them .\nRepublicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make challenging certified election results routine .\nAfter 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results , legislators in four states have launched so-called election \u201c audits \u201d of their own .\nElection deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022 .\nAnd Trump \u2019 s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot .\nWhile those efforts could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , they could take advantage this year of the new normal they \u2019 ve created .\nPoll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden \u2019 s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57 % of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately .\nThe question isn \u2019 t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election , it \u2019 s when \u2014 and whether party leaders will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past century , it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections .\nModern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections , Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said .\nBut in the 19th century , it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves , with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter .\nWith state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters , the standard of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be over .\n\u201c You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots , \u201d Whittington said .\nTrump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms .\nHe is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022 , and a good number of the party \u2019 s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results .\nIn the Washington Post survey , nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states controlled mostly by Republicans .\nAsked about states controlled by mostly Democrats , that number shot up to 56 % .\nIt \u2019 s easiest to see how this could play out in the House , where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity .\nSay a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts .\nRepublicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022 , meaning the next speaker \u2014 perhaps current Minority Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to \u201c stop the steal \u201d in races across the country .\nHe \u2014 and the rest of the Republicans in Congress \u2014 would likely be flooded with calls demanding \u201c full forensic audits.\n\u201d For this scenario to play out , Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives .\nThat would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat \u2014 or not seat \u2014 any member in a contested race .\nDemocrats could challenge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority vote to uphold it .\nUsually there are more steps in the process .\nUnder the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969 , a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation , for which there are no real ground rules , according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service .\nThe committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves .\nThey could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated .\nAnd they can make up whatever rules they \u2019 d like about which ballots to count and which not to count , regardless of state law .\nThe courts , historically , have stayed out of this ; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress \u201c shall be the judge of the elections , returns and qualifications of its own members.\n\u201d The House doesn \u2019 t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process \u2014 any member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another member .\nIt \u2019 s even possible , though very unusual , for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter .\n\u201c The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like , \u201d Whittington said .\nUltimately , a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated .\nThe Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes .\nThough contested statewide elections are less frequent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with , the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race .\nNeither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now , but both suspect the other may do so .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t trust Republicans to play fair , period , \u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said .\n\u201c This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump , \u201d said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin , who sits on both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 6 .\n\u201c Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all .\nAnd then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they \u2019 re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.\n\u201d McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday , saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results .\nRepublicans point to Pelosi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees .\nThe Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they \u2019 d made .\nMcCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race , in 1985 , when then-speaker Tip O \u2019 Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own .\nIn what has become known as a fight over Indiana \u2019 s \u201c Bloody Eighth \u201d district , House Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors and claims of vote irregularities .\nRepublicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout .\n\u201c You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race , \u201d McCarthy said .\nPelosi openly considered using the House \u2019 s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes .\nAlthough the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks \u2019 win over Democrat Rita Hart , Hart appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart , but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge .\n\u201c If I wanted to be unfair , I wouldn \u2019 t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day .\nI would have just said , they \u2019 re not seated , and that would have been my right as speaker to do , \u201d Pelosi said at the time .\nRepublicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured .\nBut if the 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority hinges on only a seat or two ?\nThere could be chaos .\nMembers from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority , leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction .\nIt could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber .\nAs with much of the American political system , the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned .\nRepublican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld , but one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with retaliation .\nIf that happens with the majority in the balance , he said , \u201c Get your seat early .\nBring your popcorn.\n\u201d \u25cf",

''\n`` I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much power , '' he said .\n`` You need a countervailing force , \u201d he said at the time .\nBlack voting rights advocates have been frustrated to see the administration \u2019 s lack of progress on federal protections while Republican-led state and local governments enact dozens of restrictive voting laws across the country .\nIn particular , grassroots advocates have felt that Biden has neglected an issue of vital importance to the same people \u2014 Black voters in the South \u2014 who helped him gain office in the first place .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood that Black people were the reason why he was elected , and in fact , Black people turned out to vote in huge numbers , \u201d said Dr. Amara Enyia , policy and research coordinator for the Movement for Black Lives , calling Biden blaming Republicans for not getting voting rights passed \u201c kind of a cop out.\n\u201d \u201c It 's quite disappointing considering the rhetoric that they use to get people engaged in the process during election season , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Now we find we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates happening and it \u2019 s not looking promising .\nIt \u2019 s really disappointing .\nBut I think it \u2019 s pretty illustrative of the Biden administration \u2019 s term so far , \u201d she said .\nAnother voting rights advocate , Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson , a Movement for Black Lives spokesperson and director of the Highlander Center , said the White House \u2019 s messaging that advocates on the ground aren \u2019 t aware of the difficulty of passing voting rights is \u201c insulting.\n\u201d \u201c Prioritizing bipartisanship over the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him into office , right , and I worry that if he does n't put up , what its gon na look like in the midterms for our people , \u201d she said .\nMaurice Mitchell , national director of the Working Families Party , said that while the American Rescue Plan and other initiatives did provide relief for Black communities in the midst of the pandemic , voting reform , and criminal justice reform are central to the promises Biden made to the Black voters who helped him win the presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Black voters on the ground on Wednesday , was defensive \u2014 and put their frustration down to a lack of communication on his part to the public about his conversations behind the scenes to sure up Democrat support for the legislation .\n\u201c I 've had their back , I 've had their back my entire career , I \u2019 ve never not had their back , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure there are those who are saying \u2018 Why didn \u2019 t Biden push the John Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month ?\nWhy didn \u2019 t he push it six months ago as hard as he did now ?\n\u201d Biden said .\n\u201c The fact is that there is a timing that is not one \u2019 s own choice , but dictated by events happening in-country and around the world on what the focus is.\n\u201d \u201c I find myself in a position where I do n't get to go out and look people in the eye \u2026 to connect with people , to let them take a measure of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that while he appreciated Biden and Harris traveling to Georgia last week to speak on voting rights , and that those kinds of pushes are also important , for Black voters \u201c it 's only as important in the context of action .\n\u201d",

        "content": "Now on sale for $ 82 , the shirts feature a slim fit , an embroidered placket , and a promise : Hugo Boss had not sourced its cotton from China \u2019 s Xinjiang region , where forced labor is rampant .\nBut these button-downs \u2014 along with dozens of other clothing shipments brought into the United States within the last year by Hugo Boss , Tommy Hilfiger , and other clothing brands \u2014 were produced by a large Chinese company called Esquel Group .\nAnd that \u2019 s a red flag .\nOn a balmy day in March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docked in Savannah , Georgia .\nOn board was a shipment of button-down shirts made of \u201c peached cotton , \u201d a fuzzy fabric meant to feel as soft as the skin of the fruit .\nEmbroidered on their pockets was the Hugo Boss logo .\nForced labor is so pervasive in China 's far west region of Xinjiang \u2014 and government control over information is so absolute \u2014 that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there .\nBut here \u2019 s what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US government placed trade restrictions on one of its Xinjiang subsidiaries , Changji Esquel Textile Co. , citing concerns over forced labor .\n\u2022 None In January 2021 , US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US , again citing forced labor .\nSince the cotton ban , a different Esquel subsidiary located in Guangdong \u2014 hundreds of miles away from Xinjiang \u2014 has continued exporting its clothes to brands in the US .\nBut procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton spinning factories .\nWhen asked repeatedly , neither Hugo Boss nor Tommy Hilfiger nor Ralph Lauren would say where the cotton in their Esquel shipments comes from .\nEsquel \u2019 s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation .\nThe company describes itself as \u201c vertically integrated , \u201d meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain : Esquel \u2019 s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds , and those fibers are later spun into yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esquel \u2019 s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth , then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong\u2013based Esquel Enterprises .\nThe company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang , where the bulk of China \u2019 s cotton is grown \u2014 but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region .\nSince the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January , at least 16 Esquel shipments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trade records show , the latest one in mid-December .\nOne shipment has arrived addressed to PVH , the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger , containing Tommy Hilfiger\u2013branded goods ; four for Ralph Lauren ; and one for Polo , a Ralph Lauren subsidiary .\nGuangdong Esquel , along with other Esquel companies , is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss \u2019 s most recently published supplier list .\nPVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list , as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News reached out for comment \u2014 PVH released an updated version of its list , and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it .\nNo Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren \u2019 s latest list , which was published in November .\nHugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel , and the company had replied that \u201c all our specifications and standards , including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions , have been and are being complied with.\n\u201d Hugo Boss also said its own audits at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of forced labor .\nPVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment .\nIn response to a list of questions , Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor .\nIt added that it follows all national import and export laws , and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions .\nAsked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang , Esquel did not give any specifics , saying only that it sources from \u201c most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable .\n\u201c Cotton is grown in Xinjiang , but then it is sold to warehouses , processors , and suppliers all over China , \u201d said Laura Murphy , professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University , who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang .\nAnd then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Every time it moves , its provenance is increasingly obscured .\nThere are many ways to track it , but so far most companies don \u2019 t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.\n\u201d A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law , importers must take \u201c reasonable care \u201d in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor .\nAsked what constitutes \u201c reasonable care , \u201d the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to \u201c become familiar with applicable laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency to protect consumers from \u201c harmful and counterfeit imports.\n\u201d As part of its campaign targeting Muslims , the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories .\nThe US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government , including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics .\nThe US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time : The US banned cotton and tomato imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor , placing the burden of proof on importers .\nThe region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies .\nChina is currently the world \u2019 s leading producer of cotton , with over 87 % of that coming from Xinjiang .\nResearch shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work \u2014 there is also evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xinjiang .\nThe Xinjiang cotton ban has become a flashpoint in the larger diplomatic row between the US and China , with the Chinese government , along with Chinese consumers and celebrities , pressuring international clothing brands to continue sourcing in the region as a show of patriotic support .\nHuman rights groups welcomed the ban but were skeptical it could be fully enforced .\nThey say forced labor by Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups , underpinned by government programs , is so widespread in Xinjiang that it \u2019 s nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure their suppliers don \u2019 t use it .\nThe political sensitivity of the issue , combined with the government \u2019 s other repressive measures targeting minority groups , has made it even more difficult for foreign companies to audit their supply chains .\nThe Better Cotton Initiative , an industry group that promotes sustainability by auditing its supply chains , stopped its reviews in Xinjiang altogether in October 2020 , citing \u201c an increasingly untenable operating environment.\n\u201d Five firms did the same .\nEsquel is the world \u2019 s largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major brands with more than 100 million every year , earning the company more than $ 1.3 billion in yearly revenue .\nEsquel operates two cotton ginning mills in Xinjiang and three spinning mills , where cotton is spun into yarn .\nBuzzFeed News was able to geolocate the three spinning mills in Xinjiang and the garment factories in Guangdong , matching images of these facilities on Esquel \u2019 s website with satellite imagery and street-level imagery from Baidu Total View and confirming their locations .\nThe book Esquel produced to celebrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its spinning mill in Xinjiang \u2019 s Turpan prefecture was established specifically to supply the Guangdong factories .\nBy 2018 , the book adds , Esquel \u2019 s investment in Xinjiang amounted to $ 100 million , including charitable donations .\nThe company did not answer a question about whether that supply route has changed .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats failed to change Senate rules on Wednesday to pass a voting rights package that they repeatedly touted as necessary to stamp out voter suppression .\nThe votes on the bill and the rule were a culmination of two major political issues facing the country : Whether the federal government should step in to reverse state-level laws seen as restricting access to the polls , and whether a minority party in the Senate should have effective veto power over almost all legislation moving through Congress .\nDemocrats lost on both fronts , marking a disappointing final day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office .\nState governments will continue to have broad authority to taper voting laws and Republicans in the minority will continue to have the power to block progressive legislation .\nIt was a foregone conclusion that the bill would fail .\nBiden conceded as much last week .\nBut in a rare move , Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pushed the votes forward despite it being a divisive issue for his party .\nUltimately Sens .\nKyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia both voted to advance the voting rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change to Senate rules to allow it to pass .\nWith all Republicans opposed , the move to change the filibuster rules failed in a vote of 48-52 .\nManchin said he could not support one party changing Senate rules \u201c through raw majority power \u201d without the cooperation of the full Senate .\n\u201c Let the change happen this way and it will be a body without rules , \u201d he said .\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor just before the final vote that he was seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules in order to reverse voter suppression across the country .\n\u201c The only way to achieve our goal of passing voter rights , ending dark money , and ending partisan gerrymandering is by changing the rules .\nBecause our colleagues from the other side of the aisle don \u2019 t want to join us in these noble endeavors , \u201d he said .\nBiden said in a statement after the vote that he was `` profoundly disappointed that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy , '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision clears the path for those documents to go to the committee as well .\nTrump lost twice in the lower courts in his bid to stop the Jan. 6 committee from getting various categories of his White House records that he maintained should be protected by executive privilege .\nOn Nov. 9 , a federal district judge in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an injunction that would stop the National Archives from turning over the documents .\nA month later , the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit again sided against Trump , upholding the district court \u2019 s decision in a 3\u20130 order .\n\u201c On the record before us , former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden \u2019 s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the Political Branches over these documents , \u201d DC Circuit Judge Patricia Millett wrote for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a unique legislative need for these documents and that they are directly relevant to the Committee \u2019 s inquiry into an attack on the Legislative Branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power.\n\u201d The Supreme Court \u2019 s Wednesday order stated that because the DC Circuit had concluded that Trump \u2019 s legal challenge would fail regardless of his status as a former president , anything that the appeals court had to say about when a former president could sue over executive privilege wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump \u2019 s case presented \u201c are unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns , \u201d the majority wrote ; the order wasn \u2019 t signed by any specific justice .\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately to say that he believed there had to be circumstances where a former president could successfully invoke privilege over their administration records even if the incumbent refused to back it .\n\u201c Concluding otherwise , \u201d Kavanaugh wrote , \u201c would eviscerate the executive privilege for Presidential communications.\n\u201d Although Trump repeatedly lost the legal arguments his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he succeeded in delaying the committee from getting his records .\nThe Archives were originally set to begin turning over documents on Nov. 12 , 2021 .\nTrump filed suit in mid-October , and while he appealed his loss in the district court , the DC Circuit agreed to temporarily block the Archives from taking action .\nThe panel then gave Trump another 14 days to petition the Supreme Court to step in , and once he did that , it extended the pause even further until the justices ruled .\nTrump filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late December asking for an immediate injunction to stop the Archives from turning over any records he \u2019 d claimed executive privilege over until the justices fully considered the case .\nHis request noted that the DC Circuit had specified that its temporary pause only applied to the first three tranches of documents , and that the archivist had identified a fourth tranche and planned to give it to the committee on Jan. 19 barring a court order .\nTrump had claimed executive privilege over six pages in the fourth tranche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers argued that the Supreme Court should block any production of contested documents \u201c for the sake of judicial efficiency and because of the similarity of the legal issues between the various tranches.\n\u201d The final brief was filed in the Supreme Court on Jan. 13 .\nOn the evening of Jan. 18 , the Justice Department submitted a letter to the DC Circuit confirming that the Archives planned to turn over the fourth tranche at the end of the next day unless any court told the agency not to do so .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archivist had been poised to produce that collection shortly after the DC Circuit \u2019 s decision in December , but Biden ordered a delay to give Trump time to go back to the lower courts to argue for another injunction .\nThe Justice Department specified that the archivist was prepared to turn over four of the six pages that Trump had objected to , since two were similar to documents in the first three tranches that remained in limbo .\nTrump \u2019 s lead attorney Jesse Binnall did not immediately return a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson for the National Archives .",

        "content": "One year after taking office and seeing Senate Republicans block most of his policy agenda , President Joe Biden said he \u201c did not anticipate \u201d their obstructionism and conceded that he will need to break up his wide-ranging social program and climate change bill to get it passed .\n`` I did not anticipate that there 'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden did n't get anything done , '' Biden said in a press conference on Wednesday , marking his first year in office .\nBiden has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stymying his policy agenda , particularly as he has come under pressure from voting rights leaders to push through voting reforms before the midterm elections , and contends with ongoing low approval ratings .\nThe White House has said for months that the American people will ultimately judge Democrats on what they \u2019 ve achieved in terms of legislation that affects their daily lives .\n\u201c Think about this : What are Republicans for ?\nWhat are they for ?\nName me one thing they \u2019 re for , \u201d he said on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly called out former president Donald Trump for pushing election conspiracy theories , and last week he criticized Senate Republicans for blocking voting rights legislation .\nOn Wednesday , he admitted that he had hoped to be able to foster greater cooperation between the two parties than he has .\n`` One of the things I have n't been able to get done is to get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country , \u201d he said , denying that he had overpromised on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heels of a president who frequently pushed divisive rhetoric and inflamed tensions between Americans , Biden ran on a platform of being able to bridge partisan gaps and get things done in Washington .\nOn the campaign trail , he often referred to his 36 years in the Senate working across the aisle and took pains to reiterate his view that Republicans at large were not the enemy .\nIn his victory speech in November 2020 , Biden made the case that Americans across the political spectrum \u2014 including Democrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperate again .\n\u201c The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a decision .\nIt \u2019 s a choice we make , \u201d he said in that speech .\nOn the campaign trail , he struck an even more conciliatory tone , telling reporters in December 2019 that he did n't want the Republican party to be totally `` clobbered . ''\n`` I 'm really worried that no party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .\n`` You need a countervailing force , \u201d he said at the time .\nBlack voting rights advocates have been frustrated to see the administration \u2019 s lack of progress on federal protections while Republican-led state and local governments enact dozens of restrictive voting laws across the country .\nIn particular , grassroots advocates have felt that Biden has neglected an issue of vital importance to the same people \u2014 Black voters in the South \u2014 who helped him gain office in the first place .\n\u201c You had President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were the reason why he was elected , and in fact , Black people turned out to vote in huge numbers , \u201d said Amara Enyia , policy and research coordinator for the Movement for Black Lives , calling Biden blaming Republicans for not getting voting rights passed \u201c kind of a cop-out.\n\u201d \u201c It 's quite disappointing considering the rhetoric that they use to get people engaged in the process during election season , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Now we find we \u2019 re in this 11th hour with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not looking promising .\nIt \u2019 s really disappointing .\nBut I think it \u2019 s pretty illustrative of the Biden administration \u2019 s term so far , \u201d she said .\nAnother voting rights advocate , Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson , a Movement for Black Lives spokesperson and director of the Highlander Research and Education Center , said the White House \u2019 s messaging that advocates on the ground aren \u2019 t aware of the difficulty of passing voting rights is \u201c insulting.\n\u201d \u201c Prioritizing bipartisanship over the very lives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , right , and I worry that if he does n't put up , what it 's gon na look like in the midterms for our people , \u201d she said .\nMaurice Mitchell , national director of the Working Families Party , said that while the American Rescue Plan and other initiatives did provide relief for Black communities in the midst of the pandemic , voting reform and criminal justice reform are central to the promises Biden made to the Black voters who helped him win the presidency .\nBiden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground on Wednesday , was defensive \u2014 and put their frustration down to a lack of communication on his part to the public about his conversations behind the scenes to shore up Democrat support for the legislation .\n\u201c I 've had their back , I 've had their back my entire career , I \u2019 ve never not had their back , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure there are those who are saying \u2018 Why didn \u2019 t Biden push the John Lewis bill as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why didn \u2019 t he push it six months ago as hard as he did now ?\n\u201d Biden said .\n\u201c The fact is that there is a timing that is not one \u2019 s own choice , but dictated by events happening in-country and around the world on what the focus is.\n\u201d \u201c I find myself in a position where I do n't get to go out and look people in the eye \u2026 to connect with people , to let them take a measure of my sincerity , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appreciated Biden and Harris traveling to Georgia last week to speak on voting rights , and that those kinds of pushes are also important , for Black voters \u201c it 's only as important in the context of action .\n\u201d",

or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of the time of publication .\nIs there a sound that makes you shudder because it reminds you of being jolted out of a deep sleep on countless cold , dark mornings ?\nI have two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm clocks and that first-ever default iPhone alarm sound that berated me into waking up for 9 a.m. classes in college .\nThankfully , there is now a gentler solution : a sunrise alarm clock .\nThese days , we tend to use our phones for everything , which can be hugely convenient .\nIf your handy smartphone provides a certain function , it can be a hard sell to invest in a separate product that serves the same purpose and takes up more space .\nBut if you \u2019 re a troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shine , especially before sunrise , a light or sunrise alarm clock may be well worth the buy .\n\u201c The key thing that these alarm clocks try to mimic is direct sunlight exposure , \u201d says Rebecca Robbins , an associate scientist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School .\n\u201c They build on the circadian science that light is a vital input to our internal circadian rhythm.\n\u201d The part of our brain that guides our circadian rhythm , Robbins explains , is housed behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptors of light that kick-start the awake phase of this 24-hour cycle .\nThat \u2019 s why exposing yourself to light in the morning , even if it \u2019 s a simulation of the sun , will help trigger that alertness by suppressing the flow of the hormone melatonin from the pineal gland in the brain .\n( Darkness triggers melatonin release , while light can halt its production . )\nThese clocks can be especially helpful in certain regions of the world , at times of the year with hours of sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to artificially replicate sunrise and sunset to signal a proper sleep schedule .\nYour circadian rhythms can also respond to decreasing light at the end of the day , according to Dr. Raj Dasgupta of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine .\nThat means that a dimming function is another helpful component to have in a sunrise alarm clock because it can help you wind down for bedtime .\nWhich sunrise alarm clock is best ?\nWhen searching for the best sunrise alarm clock for you , the sunset option is key if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have issues falling asleep as well as waking up .\nRobbins adds that warmer colors of light are a soothing effect for bedtime , while cool , bright blue tones emulate sunshine for an alerting effect in the morning , so the availability of those varying shades is key .\nThough many of us tend to depend on a snooze button , the lack of one could actually be helpful if you \u2019 re looking to establish healthier sleep habits .\n\u201c With your first alarm , you \u2019 ve extracted likely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , \u201d she says .\n\u201c The only sleep you \u2019 re getting after interrupting those really deep , rich stages is twilight sleep , which is the worst thing we can do.\n\u201d ( Twilight is stage 1 of non-REM sleep , which is a lighter stage where you can still have some awareness of what 's happening around you . )\nFor those who go with a snooze option , Dr. Dasgupta advises keeping the alarm clock out of arm \u2019 s distance so that you have to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage you to get out of bed instead of further delaying the start of your day .\nSince sleep preferences in general are quite individualized , he suggests looking for an alarm clock with adjustable features so that you can customize brightness and sound elements to your needs .\nExperts agree that while a wake-up light alone may not give you more restful nights , they can be helpful when used in conjunction with good sleep hygiene , which includes sleeping in a cool , dark room , using your bed only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking to set bedtimes and wake times .\nShelby Harris , a clinical psychologist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine , also notes that if you tend to bury your head under the covers or can \u2019 t resist repeated snooze sessions , this type of alarm clock may not be the right choice .\nIt all depends on your ideal sleep environment and where your sleeping or waking issues are stemming from .\nIf you tend to struggle to get out of bed when you \u2019 re forced to wake up in complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience season-related mood changes in general , you may have seasonal affective disorder .\nWhile anyone can have the \u201c winter blues , \u201d about 5 % of people have seasonal affective disorder , otherwise known as SAD or seasonal depression , according to the American Psychiatric Association .\nSAD is a type of depression that \u2019 s most common in fall and winter months , when there are less hours of sunlight per day , although it can occur in summer in some people .\nPeople who have SAD experience symptoms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it \u2019 s more common in women than men .\nOne common treatment is light therapy , which often comes in the form of a specific type of lamp .\n\u201c Light has a physiological direct impact on our mood , \u201d which is why light therapy helps with seasonal depression , Robbins explains .\nSince many of these sunrise alarm clocks have adjustable brightness settings , it makes sense that they could also help with some symptoms of SAD .\nThat said , light therapy for SAD treatment usually involves 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light box with a brightness of 10,000 lux each morning , or a light box with a brightness of 2,500 lux for one to two hours .\nSunrise alarm clocks tend to have a lux that \u2019 s 300 or lower .\nWhile gradual light from an alarm clock might help improve your mood and ability to wake up , follow your healthcare provider \u2019 s guidance for any light-related treatments if you \u2019 ve been diagnosed with SAD .\nWhen Dr. Dasgupta thinks about alarm clocks or any other device that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sleep , he thinks of one patient population in particular \u2014 those with insomnia .\nWhile almost everyone experiences an inability to sleep at some point , he \u2019 s referring to those with chronic insomnia , which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines as having symptoms more than three times per week for up to three months .\nInsomnia generally involves difficulty initiating sleep and maintaining sleep throughout the night .\nWhile he emphasizes that the mainstay therapy for these issues is cognitive behavioral therapy , sunrise alarm clocks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c You have to have all the right pieces to complete that puzzle to get that good sleep , \u201d he says .\n\u201c When people try different things to get good sleep , it really depends on what puzzle piece is missing.\n\u201d For some , that missing piece may be the comfort of a weighted blanket .\nFor others , a white noise machine may do the trick .\nBut if you \u2019 re sensitive to light and creating a faux dawn sounds like a nicer way to wake than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s well worth trying out one of the clocks on this list

        "content": "For years , cryptocurrency has rivaled entire nations in terms of energy use , and US lawmakers are just now starting to investigate how crypto mining operations could be undermining global efforts to combat climate change .\nThis question was the subject of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Thursday that broadly examined the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum .\nThe panel addressed a growing refrain that certain types of crypto transactions are catastrophically energy intensive and are extending the lifetime of fossil fuel resources .\nCommittee members also questioned some of the promises made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that miners can actually help stabilize energy grids .\n\u201c Our focus now needs to be reducing carbon emissions overall , and increasing the share of green energy on the grid , \u201d subcommittee Chair Rep. Diana DeGette said during introductory remarks .\nWhile the unique demands of crypto \u201c present potential benefits , \u201d DeGette continued , \u201c it \u2019 s important to understand the degree to which this is actually being done.\n\u201d The hearing marks one of the few times that lawmakers have discussed crypto \u2019 s climate implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six crypto company executives testified before the House Financial Services Committee ; one of those CEOs , Bitfury \u2019 s Brian Brooks , appeared again on Thursday as a panel witness alongside other crypto CEOs and former government officials .\n\u201c Crypto \u2019 s energy consumption is a feature , not a bug , \u201d said witness John Belizaire , CEO of data center developer Soluna Computing , claiming that \u201c the narrative of [ crypto \u2019 s ] threat to the grid is wrong.\n\u201d The crypto CEOs on the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of clean , renewable energy .\nThis approach is currently playing out in Texas , where crypto businesses , with the blessing of Sen. Ted Cruz , are flooding the state \u2019 s power grid in exchange for renewable energy support .\nAs part of these deals , crypto operations have been agreeing to voluntarily power down when energy demands are at their highest .\nBut whether that approach is sustainable or even realistic is up for question .\nWitness Steve Wright , former CEO of a consumer-owned power utility in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises in 2014 when crypto miners flocked to the area due to low electricity rates and the availability of high-speed internet .\nWhile the \u201c ability to modulate usage would be valuable , \u201d Wright said , \u201c Chelan did not receive serious modulation offers \u2014 maybe because of the desire to run [ operations ] continuously due to the short lifetime of mining machines.\n\u201d Committee members stressed concerns that despite these possibilities , miners are still incentivized to use cheap , dirty energy over sustainable power , noting the recent example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Venango County , Pennsylvania .\nFor years , researchers studying the environmental effects of cryptocurrency have warned of its ability to accelerate ecological decline .\nScientists writing for the publication Nature theorized that continued bitcoin usage , if mirroring the growth rates of other broadly adopted technologies , could produce enough emissions to raise global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius within the next two decades .\n( The goal of the Paris Accords is to limit global warming to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels . )\n\u201c To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not bring retired fossil fuel plants back online in support of [ energy intensive crypto mining ] , \u201d said Rep. Frank Pallone , chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .\nAt the core of regulatory concerns are \u201c proof of work \u201d ( PoW ) algorithms used by currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum to mine new tokens and validate transactions .\nBecause PoW involves miners competing to correctly solve a mathematical puzzle in exchange for newly minted coins , it can demand huge amounts of computing power .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d said Claudia Herbert , a PhD candidate at the University of California , Berkeley who studies carbon markets and the emerging overlap with cryptocurrency projects .\nAccording to Digiconomist , a digital trends platform that maintains a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index , bitcoin consumes 204.50 terawatt-hours of electricity annually , comparable to the power consumption of Thailand , and boasts a carbon footprint equaling that of Kuwait .\nMuch of that energy use is concentrated in the US , which accounted for roughly 35 % of the world \u2019 s bitcoin mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any single country , according to Cambridge University .\nDigiconomist \u2019 s consumption index for ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin , estimates that its electrical usage is equal to that of the Netherlands , and that its carbon footprint is roughly the size of Sweden .\nPoW \u201c needs to be intensely regulated , \u201d said Zane Griffin Talley Cooper , a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania who has researched the energy costs of crypto in places like Iceland and Greenland .\nAlternatively , the committee \u2019 s memo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PoS ) algorithms as evidence that some mechanisms \u201c can provide secure , trusted transaction infrastructure without the same energy intensity as popular [ proof of work ] blockchains.\n\u201d By comparison , PoS demands fewer computing resources by selecting who gets to validate a transaction based on the amount of crypto they \u2019 ve put up as collateral .\nEthereum has said it will transition to PoS this year , noting its \u201c better energy efficiency.\n\u201d While the US contemplates how to lower crypto \u2019 s energy consumption , other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part due to environmental and energy concerns .\nIn 2021 , China enacted a ban on all bitcoin transactions after having mined two-thirds of the world \u2019 s bitcoins the year prior .\nNeighboring countries like Kazakhstan saw the cascading effects of China \u2019 s crackdown as mining operations flooded their borders and energy grid , taking advantage of empty warehouses and low electricity costs .\nSwedish regulators are now calling for a ban on PoW mining throughout the European Union .\nAt the hearing , no committee member suggested a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential solutions like legislation requiring crypto companies to use a certain mix of renewable fuels , but members mostly emphasized their desire to make space for blockchain technologies while also prioritizing US climate goals or energy interests .\n\u201c While the industry has matured and there are now responsible actors in this space , we should be ready to collaborate and encourage innovation and investment in cleaner renewable energy , \u201d Pallone said .",

using your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and sticking to set bedtimes and wake times .\nShelby Harris , a clinical psychologist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine , also notes that if you tend to bury your head under the covers or can \u2019 t resist repeated snooze sessions , this type of alarm clock may not be the right choice .\nIt all depends on your ideal sleep environment and where your sleeping or waking issues are stemming from .\nIf you tend to struggle to get out of bed when you \u2019 re forced to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you experience season-related mood changes in general , you may have seasonal affective disorder .\nWhile anyone can have the \u201c winter blues , \u201d about 5 % of people have seasonal affective disorder , otherwise known as SAD or seasonal depression , according to the American Psychiatric Association .\nSAD is a type of depression that \u2019 s most common in fall and winter months , when there are fewer hours of sunlight per day , although it can occur in summer in some people .\nPeople who have SAD experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and it \u2019 s more common in women than men .\nOne common treatment is light therapy , which often comes in the form of a specific type of lamp .\n\u201c Light has a physiological direct impact on our mood , \u201d which is why light therapy helps with seasonal depression , Robbins explained .\nSince many of these sunrise alarm clocks have adjustable brightness settings , it makes sense that they could also help with some symptoms of SAD .\nThat said , light therapy for SAD treatment usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to a lightbox with a brightness of 10,000 lux each morning or a lightbox with a brightness of 2,500 lux for one to two hours .\nSunrise alarm clocks tend to have a lux that \u2019 s 300 or lower .\nWhile gradual light from an alarm clock might help improve your mood and ability to wake up , follow your healthcare provider \u2019 s guidance for any light-related treatments if you \u2019 ve been diagnosed with SAD .\nWhen Dr. Dasgupta thinks about alarm clocks or any other device that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , he thinks of one patient population in particular \u2014 those with insomnia .\nWhile almost everyone experiences an inability to sleep at some point , he \u2019 s referring to those with chronic insomnia , which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines as having symptoms more than three times per week for up to three months .\nInsomnia generally involves difficulty initiating sleep and maintaining sleep throughout the night .\nWhile he emphasizes that the mainstay therapy for these issues is cognitive behavioral therapy , sunrise alarm clocks are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c You have to have all the right pieces to complete that puzzle to get that good sleep , \u201d he said .\n\u201c When people try different things to get good sleep , it really depends on what puzzle piece is missing.\n\u201d For some , that missing piece may be the comfort of a weighted blanket .\nFor others , a white noise machine may do the trick .\nBut if you \u2019 re sensitive to light and creating faux dawn sounds like a nicer way to wake than jarring beeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth trying out one of the clocks on this list .",

        "content": "One year after taking office and seeing Senate Republicans block most of his policy agenda , President Joe Biden said he \u201c did not anticipate \u201d their obstructionism and conceded that he will need to break up his wide-ranging social program and climate change bill to get it passed .\n`` I did not anticipate that there 'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden did n't get anything done , '' Biden said in a press conference on Wednesday , marking his first year in office .\nBiden has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stymying his policy agenda , particularly as he has come under pressure from voting rights leaders to push through voting reforms before the midterm elections , and contends with ongoing low approval ratings .\nThe White House has said for months that the American people will ultimately judge Democrats on what they \u2019 ve achieved in terms of legislation that affects their daily lives .\n\u201c Think about this : What are Republicans for ?\nWhat are they for ?\nName me one thing they \u2019 re for , \u201d he said on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly called out former president Donald Trump for pushing election conspiracy theories , and last week he criticized Senate Republicans for blocking voting rights legislation .\nOn Wednesday , he admitted that he had hoped to be able to foster greater cooperation between the two parties than he has .\n`` One of the things I have n't been able to get done is to get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country , \u201d he said , denying that he had overpromised on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heels of a president who frequently pushed divisive rhetoric and inflamed tensions between Americans , Biden ran on a platform of being able to bridge partisan gaps and get things done in Washington .\nOn the campaign trail , he often referred to his 36 years in the Senate working across the aisle and took pains to reiterate his view that Republicans at large were not the enemy .\nIn his victory speech in November 2020 , Biden made the case that Americans across the political spectrum \u2014 including Democrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperate again .\n\u201c The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a decision .\nIt \u2019 s a choice we make , \u201d he said in that speech .\nOn the campaign trail , he struck an even more conciliatory tone , telling reporters in December 2019 that he did n't want the Republican party to be totally `` clobbered . ''\n`` I 'm really worried that no party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .\n`` You need a countervailing force , \u201d he said at the time .\nBlack voting rights advocates have been frustrated to see the administration \u2019 s lack of progress on federal protections while Republican-led state and local governments enact dozens of restrictive voting laws across the country .\nIn particular , grassroots advocates have felt that Biden has neglected an issue of vital importance to the same people \u2014 Black voters in the South \u2014 who helped him gain office in the first place .\n\u201c You had President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were the reason why he was elected , and in fact , Black people turned out to vote in huge numbers , \u201d said Amara Enyia , policy and research coordinator for the Movement for Black Lives , calling Biden blaming Republicans for not getting voting rights passed \u201c kind of a cop-out.\n\u201d \u201c It 's quite disappointing considering the rhetoric that they use to get people engaged in the process during election season , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Now we find we \u2019 re in this 11th hour with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not looking promising .\nIt \u2019 s really disappointing .\nBut I think it \u2019 s pretty illustrative of the Biden administration \u2019 s term so far , \u201d she said .\nAnother voting rights advocate , Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson , a Movement for Black Lives spokesperson and director of the Highlander Research and Education Center , said the White House \u2019 s messaging that advocates on the ground aren \u2019 t aware of the difficulty of passing voting rights is \u201c insulting.\n\u201d \u201c Prioritizing bipartisanship over the very lives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , right , and I worry that if he does n't put up , what it 's gon na look like in the midterms for our people , \u201d she said .\nMaurice Mitchell , national director of the Working Families Party , said that while the American Rescue Plan and other initiatives did provide relief for Black communities in the midst of the pandemic , voting reform and criminal justice reform are central to the promises Biden made to the Black voters who helped him win the presidency .\nBiden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground on Wednesday , was defensive \u2014 and put their frustration down to a lack of communication on his part to the public about his conversations behind the scenes to shore up Democrat support for the legislation .\n\u201c I 've had their back , I 've had their back my entire career , I \u2019 ve never not had their back , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure there are those who are saying \u2018 Why didn \u2019 t Biden push the John Lewis bill as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why didn \u2019 t he push it six months ago as hard as he did now ?\n\u201d Biden said .\n\u201c The fact is that there is a timing that is not one \u2019 s own choice , but dictated by events happening in-country and around the world on what the focus is.\n\u201d \u201c I find myself in a position where I do n't get to go out and look people in the eye \u2026 to connect with people , to let them take a measure of my sincerity , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appreciated Biden and Harris traveling to Georgia last week to speak on voting rights , and that those kinds of pushes are also important , for Black voters \u201c it 's only as important in the context of action .\n\u201d",

        "content": "During the past two years of the pandemic , there have been some profound racial and ethnic disparities , with some communities of color having COVID hospitalization and mortality rates more than double that of other groups of people .\nNow , a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report suggests there are inequities in the use of lifesaving COVID treatments , with some people less likely than others to get early treatment with monoclonal antibodies , which has been shown to prevent hospitalizations and deaths .\nThe analysis found that people who are Hispanic faced the most barriers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies 58 % less often than their non-Hispanic peers .\nPatients who were Asian , as well as those who identified with the \u201c other \u201d category , including Native American , Alaska Native , Native Hawaiian , and multiracial patients , received monoclonal antibodies about 48 % and 47 % less often , respectively , than white patients .\nBlack patients were treated with the protective proteins 22 % less often .\nThe research team , led by Jennifer Wiltz and Amy Feehan , looked at electronic records for COVID treatments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 US healthcare systems between November 2020 and August 2021 .\nAbout 11 % were treated in a hospital , where the differences in use among racial and ethnic groups were less pronounced .\nThe treatments included monoclonal antibodies , the antiviral medication remdesivir , and the steroid dexamethasone , which is used to fight inflammation .\nSome are used early on in an infection and can help prevent COVID hospitalization , like monoclonal antibodies .\nOthers , like steroids , are used later in serious cases to battle out-of-control immune reactions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 4 % or less for all racial and ethnic groups , according to the report released Jan. 14 .\nMonoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins infused or injected into patients , typically in health clinics or doctor \u2019 s offices within 10 days of symptoms .\nOverall , average monthly use of monoclonal antibodies was low : 4 % in white patients , 2.8 % in Black patients , 2.2 % in patients who were Asian or another race , and 1.8 % in Hispanic patients .\nOnce hospitalized , there seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dexamethasone , and patients who were Black received remdesivir about 9 % more often than others .\nThe researchers said the disparities they uncovered with monoclonal antibodies may not reflect those in the real world because they were restricted to patients who received COVID treatments through a healthcare system ; monoclonal antibodies can be given to patients in government-run infusion sites that likely go unrecorded .\nThe researchers also didn \u2019 t analyze the reason for the disparities , but they speculate that a number of systemic factors are likely to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , insufficient health insurance , potential bias among medical professionals or a lack of a primary care doctor to recommend the treatments , and language barriers , which can leave people unaware of therapies and vulnerable to severe yet preventable COVID outcomes .\nThese factors also make it more likely people of color will develop medical conditions that raise their chances of severe COVID , the CDC says , contributing to disproportionate coronavirus infection , hospitalization , and death rates among racial and ethnic groups .\n\u201c I just want to emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , \u201d Dr. Utibe Essien , an assistant professor of medicine and health disparities researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c This is not a new issue .\nThere are so many tiers and levers that we can all be pulling to address this , going all the way from when these drugs are developed to who is present in the studies that test these drugs to how easy is it for patients to access medications at a doctor or pharmacy.\n\u201d There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse \u201d these disparities , Dr. Amesh Adalja , an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security , told BuzzFeed News .\nMobile clinics that bring monoclonal antibody treatments to patients and telemedicine visits that make it easier to see a doctor can help spread awareness and access to treatments for high-risk patients .\nOne recent study found telemedicine visits helped increase attendance at follow-up doctor \u2019 s appointments after hospitalization from 52 % to 70 % among Black patients .\nThe study included patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason from January 2019 to June 2020 .\nIn contrast , follow-up care among white patients dropped slightly , from 68 % to 67 % in the same period .\nCOVID treatment guidelines don \u2019 t always take into account race and ethnicity Although the CDC study looked at patients treated before the Omicron and Delta surges , some states like North Carolina , Texas , and Mississippi are still struggling with COVID treatment shortages , leading doctors to prioritize therapies for the highest-risk patients .\nNational health officials often recommend COVID treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own recommendations , meaning guidance and access to COVID therapies may differ depending on where you live .\nThe FDA , for example , includes race and ethnicity as a potential risk factor for severe COVID in its medication fact sheets for healthcare providers .\nAn FDA spokesperson told BuzzFeed News it \u2019 s up to doctors to \u201c consider the benefit-risk for an individual patient \u201d when determining access to therapies .\nSome states like New York and Utah have adopted that language , stating doctors should consider race and ethnicity when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID .",

        "content": "The app claims to rely on science and psychology to help you lose weight .\nBut it may not be that different from any other deprivation diet .\nI keep getting this ad for the Noom app , served up with so many YouTube videos and cable TV shows that I feel uniquely targeted by them .\nIt begins with a supercut of an attractive young man clearing plate after plate at restaurants , waving off waiters while a folksy cover of \u201c Where Is My Mind \u201d by The Pixies plays .\nThen he stares agape at his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks and drinking beer .\n\u201c I was conditioned to finish my plate since childhood ?\n\u201d he says , astonished ; we see a flashback of a kid mopping up the last of an egg while his father glares at him .\n\u201c When it comes to losing weight , it \u2019 s psychological , \u201d the voiceover says .\nThe message : Noom is different .\nIt will help you get thinner the smart way .\nMuch of Noom \u2019 s advertising leans on this \u201c not like the other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet .\nStart going on Noom , \u201d one ad says .\n\u201c The last weight loss program you \u2019 ll ever need , \u201d another says .\nThe people who work there use the same framing .\n\u201c We think of it as a health and wellness tool , \u201d Noom President Artem Petkov told me over Zoom last year .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a psychology-minded type of education .\nIt \u2019 s how you teach people the behavioral science of these things , to empower them .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I google \u201c diet , \u201d the first result is a Noom ad ( your algorithm may vary ) .\nNoom \u2019 s core offering is called Noom Weight , which \u201c empowers participants to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle intervention.\n\u201d One prong is a general \u201c health \u201d program , and there \u2019 s another for those looking to manage their diabetes , but it \u2019 s clear that at least one major purpose of Noom is to help you lose weight \u2014 key elements include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text that emphasizes losing weight .\nNoom says it wants to help you lose weight \u201c sustainably , \u201d meaning gradually , long-term , and through behavioral changes as opposed to rigid rules and elimination diets .\nIn one Noom ad , a woman talks about how she lost 87 pounds , saying that in order to lose the weight , she had to \u2014 and here , she taps on her head \u2014 lose the weight .\n\u201c We consider ourselves to be a digital health platform , \u201d a Noom spokesperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Calling Noom a diet is like calling a car an engine or a ship a sail \u2014 it \u2019 s a part of the vehicle but not the whole picture.\n\u201d ( Noom also has a newer offering called Noom Mood , designed to \u201c help you develop the techniques , emotional awareness and resilience to reduce stress and live a happier life.\n\u201d ) Noom does differ from its competitors in two ways .\nFirst , its novel app-based approach explains the \u201c psychology \u201d of what you \u2019 re choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating , and when you \u2019 re eating .\n\u201c We use gold-standard principles from psychology ( CBT , ACT , DBT , etc . )\nto help users understand why they should and how they can create healthier behaviors \u2014 not just what to eat , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me via email .\nThe goal is to teach your brain to overcome bad habits and unnecessary calories .\nCravings are contextualized as emotional eating , and emotional eating as conquerable .\nSecond , it \u2019 s much more expensive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership is around $ 60 , while comparable Weight Watchers services , for example , run to about half that price .\nBut none of this really differentiates Noom from the diet programs and apps it seeks to define itself against .\nUltimately , its aims are the same : to help you eat less , so you can weigh less .\nWe might as well get this out of the way : Diets don \u2019 t work .\nIt \u2019 s been proven many , many , many times .\nEven if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short term , you \u2019 re more likely to gain that weight back than to actually keep it off .\nDeprivation diets in particular impact your metabolism , making it even harder to keep that weight off in the future .\n( That \u2019 s why a lot of The Biggest Loser contestants struggle to keep their weight down after they leave the show , which reportedly restricts what they eat to under 1,000 calories a day . )\nBecause of an antiquated idea from the early 1900s , most deprivation diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,500 daily calorie allotment , which is essentially equivalent to the appropriate amount of food for a particularly large dog .\nDiets that require you to cut out entire food groups \u2014 like the keto diet or the Whole30 program \u2014 could fail in similar ways .\nEven if you do lose weight , you \u2019 re unlikely to keep it off , and at worst , your metabolism slows down long term .\nNoom has one other similarity with its competitors : Its approach suggests that losing weight is simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily true .\nPsychology is just one influence , because biochemistry , genetics , and environment play a role too .\nThe way Noom sees it , cravings and caloric needs beyond its guidelines are compulsions that your mind can crush .\nBut do understanding and modifying your thoughts really help if you live in a food desert ?\nCan you mind over matter yourself out of starvation mode while eating far less than what your body actually requires to function optimally ?\nPerhaps the most significant difference is really Noom \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached beyond the traditional weight-loss audience of women to also target men .\nNoom ads feature a lot of men , and the app seems to have a higher percentage of male users than others in its category .\n( When asked , Noom would not confirm their user demographics . )\nUnlike wellness and diet programs marketed to women ( like Gwyneth Paltrow \u2019 s juice cleanse routine ) , which are usually promoted using the flowery language of self-care and beach-body imagery , Noom presents itself as rooted in science .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard facts .\nIt \u2019 s a diet app that \u2019 s dressed up in a therapist \u2019 s blazer and slacks , giving you advice on how to change for the \u201c better , \u201d telling you that if only you could just get out of your own way , you could do the impossible and make this diet work for the rest of your life .\nIt \u2019 s not like Noom invented the idea of men dieting .\nKeto-based plans are often marketed to men and 10 % of Weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 11th century , William the Conqueror lost weight by going on a liquid diet of nothing but alcohol and became thin enough to resume riding his beloved horse .\n( In 1087 , though , he died in a riding accident . )\nIn the \u2018 50s , people started drinking apple cider vinegar to stay thin , something that Lord Byron did in the 19th century .\nAnd in the \u2018 60s , \u201c The Drinking Man \u2019 s Diet \u201d was introduced , advising men to drink as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while eating fish and steak .\nIn 2019 , the diet market reached a record $ 78 billion in the US alone ( there was a small decline in 2020 because of the pandemic ) .\nAnd the male weight-loss market is steadily growing ; for the last decade , Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig have seemingly also been refocusing some of their energy to capture the male market .\nIn 2018 , Atkins brought in Rob Lowe \u2014 their first male spokesperson \u2014 to promote their products to other men .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Noom is right at the top , promising to change your life in just 16 weeks .\nNoom was founded in 2008 , the brainchild of 42-year-old Saeju Jeong , who came up with the idea after his father died of lung cancer 20 years ago .\nRaised in South Korea , Jeong started his first business \u2014 a record label \u2014 at 19 before moving to the US in 2005 and launching the app in 2016 .\n\u201c We want to help many lives , as many as we can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in an interview last year .\n\u201c Weight management is the most effective and efficient way to deliver health .\nIt \u2019 s simple .\nIt \u2019 s powerful.\n\u201d 14 years later , Noom is generating $ 400 million in revenue and is gearing up for a $ 10 billion valuation once it launches an IPO , which could happen this year or in early 2023 .\nThe diet industry has changed significantly in the last few years , turning away from promoting weight loss and toward \u201c wellness.\n\u201d If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restrictive program used to lose weight , then the language of wellness is often employed for a softer , gentler approach .\nWeight Watchers is now called WW , sometimes referred to as WellnessWins .\nThe low-carb Atkins diet is now about \u201c a life well lived , \u201d and Jenny Craig \u2019 s site has a Healthy Habits section with suggestions that go beyond weight loss .\nBy also co-opting the language of wellness , Noom has effectively captured people \u2019 s attention \u2014 the app reportedly has 50 million users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum have lent high-profile shine as well : \u201c Noom \u2019 s mix of empathetic human support paired with modern technology and science makes it possible for people to achieve significant , lasting behavior change , \u201d Williams said in a 2019 Noom press release .\nBut what anti-diet nutritionists and therapists see are the same old diet culture rules , just wrapped up in a different skin .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a good example of diet culture shape-shifting , \u201d said Evelyn Tribole , a registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intuitive Eating .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve seen Weight Watchers rebrand because they \u2019 re trying to move away from dieting .\nYou can call it whatever you want .\nYou can say you \u2019 re using mindful tools .\nIn the end , when you \u2019 re counting calories and categorizing food and tracking your weight , it \u2019 s a diet.\n\u201d When you give Noom any of your information , it talks back to you like a comforting coach , someone who \u2019 s on your team no matter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate just like a diet , albeit one made to look like a gamified MyFitnessPal .\nThe interface for Noom looks a little like a board game , your marker steadily moving along the path every day you use it .\nThe app quizzes you and rewards you with encouragement when you get the right answers .\nIt gives you the endorphin rush of checking off a box on a to-do list .\nEven before you sign into the app , the Noom website asks a series of questions to hook you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person \u2019 s potential weight loss .\n( Noom claims it can help you lose one to two pounds a week . )\nWhen you respond to a questionnaire that asks about health risks like diabetes or high blood pressure , it coos back , \u201c We \u2019 re really glad you shared .\nWeight loss is an important goal , but Noom \u2019 s mission is helping people get healthier , whatever that is for them.\n\u201d The questionnaire also asks whether you have an \u201c active diagnosis \u201d of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it suggests you talk to a therapist instead of continuing to sign up for Noom . )\nLike many other web-based diet programs or trackers , the Noom app requires you to input all your calories and movements .\nIt categorizes your food : green ( largely fresh fruit and vegetables ) , yellow ( lean meats and dairy ) , and red ( desserts , saturated fats ) .\nYour green allotment is limitless , while just a couple hundred calories of red is permitted a day .\nWhen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirps back , \u201c Great choice \u2014 Enjoy !\n\u201d but red foods come with the warning , \u201c Limit your portions.\n\u201d ( Calorie counts for each category are listed in small print . )\nYou \u2019 re prompted to weigh yourself daily so the app can track your \u201c progress.\n\u201d If you forget to log into the app for more than a day or two , you \u2019 re sent a text to remind you to get back in there .\nThe app assigns you daily tasks , like reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more \u201c mindful \u201d when you \u2019 re stress-eating .\nYou also get a series of motivational sticky notes that say things like , \u201c Stop saying I wish .\nStart saying I will , \u201d and \u201c Great things never come from comfort zones.\n\u201d Another day , it \u2019 ll present you with a PowerPoint-like presentation featuring the definition for metacognition , \u201c a fancy psych term that describes an awareness and understanding of one \u2019 s thoughts and thought processes.\n\u201d You are told to \u201c embrace \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noom assigns each user a coach to work with one-on-one \u2014 the company employs 3,000 coaches across the country , all trained as dieticians , psychologists , or therapists \u2014 as well as a support group , where users can keep each other on track .\n\u201c We have a lot of customers who might not get the weight loss that they want to get , but what we hear all the time is , \u2018 I feel different as a person , \u2019 \u201d Andreas Michaelides , chief of psychology at Noom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 I have a different relationship with food .\nI have a different relationship with my body.\n\u2019 \u201d But the psychological element is exactly what may make Noom potentially harmful .\nWhen you fail at Noom , you don \u2019 t just fail the way you might fail a typical diet \u2014 physically , because your body needs more food or is craving calories or comfort \u2014 but you also fail psychologically .\nBoth Tribole and her Intuitive Eating coauthor , nutrition therapist Elyse Resch , have had clients who have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complicated relationship with food .\n\u201c It becomes a mindfuck for our patients , because they think , Oh my god , I tried the psychology and it doesn \u2019 t work , \u201d Tribole said .\nAnd as with other diets , it seems inevitable that many users will fail Noom \u2019 s program .\n\u201c They \u2019 re telling you it could be mind over matter , but it \u2019 s not possible .\nThe survival part of the brain is going to do whatever it can to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can learn how to have power over [ other habits ] but not something that \u2019 s so physiological and neurochemical .\nYou can not overcome that unless you \u2019 re priming yourself for a very serious eating disorder.\n\u201d \u201c This has an impact , causing food obsessionality , food worry , food anxiety , feeling like you \u2019 re lost , out of control eating , \u201d Tribole said .\nShe likened a diet to being pulled underwater by an ocean \u2019 s riptides .\n\u201c When a big set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you hold your breath .\nWhen you come back up , you can take a big breath : ahhhh .\nNo one denigrates you , Oh my god , you \u2019 re addicted to air .\nThis is what happens when you restrict your eating below what your body needs it to be .\nYou \u2019 re going to be gasping for food.\n\u201d I tried Noom twice , and both times I failed .\nI lost a little weight , but not much \u2014 the app told me to consume just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nearly enough for my 5-foot-5-inch frame .\nI binged every night ; I felt like a failure .\nBut Noom considers failing a part of the process .\n\u201c The psychological tools we teach are geared towards a holistic understanding of how people can use their self-awareness to change any type of behavior , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me .\n\u201c We hear many instances of people who might not lose the amount of weight they wanted when they came into the program but leave with a great deal of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-compassion.\n\u201d Using these apps is different for everyone , and some people I spoke to did have success losing weight .\nBut others said they had trouble like I did , which impacted their sense of self-worth .\n\u201c When I joined Noom , I was probably at my leanest and strongest .\nPhysically , I was my most capable , \u201d said Kate ( who asked to be identified by a pseudonym ) , a 27-year-old woman who tried Noom in 2019 .\n\u201c Once I got on Noom and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deteriorated .\nIt overpowered how strong I felt in my body .\nThose weigh-ins definitely messed with my head.\n\u201d The dozens of women I spoke to about Noom had some version of this story : They joined the app to lose that last 10 pounds , or to work on their relationship with food , and were instead rattled by the weigh-ins and the tight calorie count ( \u201c Almonds are a red food , \u201d Kate said , incredulous ) .\nThey also didn \u2019 t find the psychological element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raised in some form of diet culture , meaning that they already knew some of Noom \u2019 s tips \u2014 like taking a sip of water between bites to slow you down \u2014 and decided the app might not be worth $ 60 a month .\n\u201c [ It \u2019 s ] mental gymnastics and rhetorical pretzel-twisting to say this isn \u2019 t about weight , it \u2019 s about psychology , \u201d Christy Harrison , registered dietician and author of Anti-Diet , said .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen Noom try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the numbers and you \u2019 re not a failure if your weight doesn \u2019 t change , but how does that square with making people weigh themselves every day , and using a traffic light system to categorize foods ?\nOf course that creates a sense of good and bad foods.\n\u201d Even the app \u2019 s framing of how you eat can feel weaponized .\nTake , for example , the way Noom talks about cravings , describing them as an \u201c inner elephant , \u201d an \u201c impulsive , irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tame your elephant , to make it behave .\nBut that really means you should behave .\n\u201c The emotional eating piece really gets to me , the way it demonizes emotional eating , meanwhile creating the conditions for it to happen , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c Of course you \u2019 re going to feel so deprived after a few days or weeks of a 1,200 calorie diet .\nI would be crawling out of my skin.\n\u201d Also : an elephant ?\nReally ?\nCome on .\nNoom \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in the context of the male-dominated trends of bio-hacking and self-optimization .\nLast year , former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed to follow one of the most horrific diets I \u2019 ve ever heard of : one meal per weekday , and a full weekend of fasting .\n( This is a version of intermittent fasting \u2014 which is usually a 16-hour fast , or one 24-hour fast a week , and not two full days of starvation , which is an unhealthy routine . )\nThere are fasting clubs in Silicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and step with interactive watches and rings , and a lot of those devices are targeted specifically to men looking to optimize their bodies and brains .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not quite as extreme as Jack Dorsey \u2019 s intermittent fasting thing , but it \u2019 s still this instrumentalization of your relationship with food , putting it into the realm of intellect and numbers and apps , \u201d Harrison said of Noom \u2019 s method .\n\u201c I have seen men for whom Noom was the trigger \u2014 it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of severely disordered eating.\n\u201d Men make up around 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 cases of eating disorders , but many of them rarely get treatment .\nThe app might also speak to men because they are traditionally not very practiced in talking about their feelings , especially around food , and Noom seemingly provides a space to do so , or at least think about food a little differently .\n\u201c Often men have a harder time accessing their feelings and acknowledging that they have eating issues , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along so maybe their brains find that more accessible.\n\u201d For men , longstanding diet tips might actually feel new \u2014 especially because Noom presents them as digestible factoids .\nFor example , for every calorie you burn , you get half a calorie back for your food intake .\nNoom explains it thusly : \u201c When you create a calorie deficit , you \u2019 ll lose more weight .\nIt \u2019 s math .\nAnd science.\n\u201d \u201c It has that sciency veneer , the emphasis on psychology .\nThis is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , that speaks to men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s funny how common those diet rules are for women.\n\u201d For men , meanwhile , those rules are framed as brand new , and much more revelatory for their eating habits .\nNone of the men I spoke to said they were unhappy with the app .\n32-year-old Alex Thibodeau told me he has been using the app for around four months \u2014 he started after getting targeted ads on Instagram \u2014 and said he had lost around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me to sign up for it was the alleged promise of it being psychological , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They make using their app habitual .\nThe prompting they do keeps you addicted .\nIt makes me feel more accountable.\n\u201d Thibodeau said his progress on Noom has plateaued , but felt this was more to do with him than the app \u2019 s failings .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t feel as though it was a scam in the way that I feel a lot of apps tend to overpromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The shortcomings I \u2019 ve experienced with it are more to do with my lack of interest than the effectiveness of the app.\n\u201d ( Tribole said that was another unique characteristic of diets .\n\u201c [ Dieting ] is the only industry that blames the consumer , and the consumer believes it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s gaslighting 101.\n\u201d ) For 55-year-old Chris McNaught , it \u2019 s not the theory so much as the accountability element that has proved useful .\nMcNaught said he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\n( He regained 20 pounds after quitting the app , and has since rejoined . )\n\u201c I \u2019 m actually a licensed professional counselor , \u201d he said .\n\u201c [ Noom ] hasn \u2019 t taught me anything I didn \u2019 t already know , but they put it in concrete terms for me , why I think about food the way I do and the habits I repeat.\n\u201d McNaught said that Noom helped him break one of his unhealthy eating habits , namely going to Sonic after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t hungry .\n\u2018 That was one of my \u2018 fog \u2019 eating scripts , \u201d he said , using Noom \u2019 s term for consuming food when \u201c not fully present.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 m just trying to establish a new normal .\nI \u2019 m not going to be on Noom forever.\n\u201d At 5 feet , 10 inches , Thibodeau was told by the app to eat around 1,900 calories a day .\nMcNaught , at 6 feet , was told to eat just 1,500 calories .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around 5 feet , 7 inches or taller ) reported that they were told to consume between 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day .\nThis , simply put , is not enough .\n( When I asked Noom if they considered this amount of food sufficient for adult men , they said yes .\n\u201c There are a variety of inputs that get individuals to a recommended calorie goal \u2014 all based on safe and scientifically-proven research , \u201d a spokesperson said .\n\u201c Noom \u2019 s calorie budget is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and users have the option to manually adjust their goal.\n\u201d ) According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , intake for men should generally range between 2,400 to 3,000 calories a day .\n\u201c This is ridiculous , \u201d Resch said .\n\u201c They will feel starved on this calorie allotment.\n\u201d Resch mentioned the 1944 Minnesota Starvation Experiment , where men spent three months eating a diet of 3,200 calories a day , followed by six months of 1,570 calories a day ( split into breakfast and lunch ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamina , body temperature , heart rate , and sex drive .\nThe men became obsessed with food , fantasizing about it , becoming more depressed and irritable as time went on .\nMen may be an important market for Noom and its competitors because women are starting to diet less .\nOver the last three decades , fewer people have been dieting in general , but women are leading the charge against traditional diet programs .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this growing movement towards body positivity , weight inclusivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold for women and also trans folks and marginalized folks , a little more so than [ for ] cis straight white men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c The diet industry in general , and maybe Noom in particular , is looking to expand their market base.\n\u201d Last week , a friend who lives on the West Coast texted me from his parents \u2019 house .\nHe \u2019 d seen that ubiquitous Noom ad while watching sports on TV .\nHe was surprised \u2014 when was the last time he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe funny thing about that ad , which features the man finishing his meal , is that it focuses more on how he eats all his food than why he originally felt obligated to eat everything on it .\nThe way his dad glares at him while he does it is striking .\nHow did his father make him feel about not finishing his plate , or conversely , about eating \u201c too much \u201d ?\nWhat kind of psychological trauma might be tied up between him and his relationship with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play if someone is eating beyond satiety or undereating , if someone \u2019 s relationship with food is fraught and painful and demoralizing .\nWhich is what makes Noom so frustrating for some people .\nThe point of Noom , like most wellness-based diet programs , is still to get you to lose weight .\nAnd just because you \u2019 re using psychological tools in hopes of reshaping your brain into eating less food , less frequently , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that those are healthy habits .\nKnowing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain way doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re bound to change in a holistic , healthy way .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t have to track their calorie count , their exercise , label foods , weigh themselves every day , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u2018 There \u2019 s another way to live , beyond all this obsession.\n\u201d \u25cf If you \u2019 re dealing with an eating disorder and need someone to talk to , the National Eating Disorders Association helpline is 1-800-931-2237 ; for 24/7 crisis support , text \u201c @ @ @ @ @",

border cities where they \u2019 re often targeted for extortion , kidnapping , or assault , said Chelsea Sachau , an attorney with the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project , which provides free legal aid to detained immigrants facing deportation in Arizona and asylum-seekers in Nogales , Mexico .\nIt was only when she told Customs and Border Protection that she was going to ask members of Congress to intervene that the agency granted exemptions to four families , which allowed them to enter the US without humanitarian parole .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a congressperson for a child with blood clots in the brain or [ a ] tangled spinal cord to be considered urgent humanitarian circumstances and therefore allowed into the US , \u201d Sachau said .\nPart of the issue is that the statute that includes humanitarian parole is written in a way that gives a lot of discretion to CBP officials who often don \u2019 t include a reason as to why they \u2019 re denying the request .\nThis makes it hard for attorneys to know what criteria their clients need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines for who qualifies for humanitarian parole .\nUnderstanding why an immigrant is denied humanitarian parole is especially crucial now that it \u2019 s one of the few avenues for asylum-seekers to enter the US , Sachau said .\nMost immigrants and asylum-seekers at the border are currently being blocked from entering the country under a Trump-era policy the Biden administration has continued to use .\nCiting an obscure public health law known as Title 42 to contain the coronavirus , the US immediately expels immigrants at the border , blocking them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Title 42 exemptions for vulnerable immigrants through a lawsuit filed by the ACLU , as well as a separate process by which organizations chosen by the Biden administration identified people who were facing heightened risks in Mexico , but they no longer exist .\nSo now , humanitarian parole is one of the few lifelines asylum-seekers have .\nSachau said she expected to have a more difficult time getting asylum-seekers exempt from Title 42 after the settlement talks ended and humanitarian groups stopped working with the government .\nHowever , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ignored or denied for months until attorneys warned border officials that their next call would be to members of Congress .\n\u201c We really are only submitting the most at-risk , the most vulnerable cases whose lives are threatened if they do n't receive safety in the US , \u201d Sachau said .\nIn a Dec. 9 , 2021 , letter to CBP and Border Patrol , Osborn Maledon , an Arizona-based law firm , called for transparency into the humanitarian parole process and said that while officials have the discretion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions are not exempt from judicial review .\nEach humanitarian parole denial must include specific reasons in writing that would allow a court to determine whether the decision was legitimate , the letter said .\nAttorneys argued a lack of response to a request doesn \u2019 t meet legal standards that would allow for such a review , and that cursory denials stating the decision was made \u201c on a case-by-case basis \u201d failed to show that border officials had actually used their discretion .\nThe letter also called for US immigration officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timely manner and publicize procedures on how to request it , in part because most immigrants do n't have attorneys who are willing to argue their case .\nIn response to a message from Sachau asking why a request was denied , a program manager at CBP 's Tucson field office said no guidelines exist on what criteria immigrants need to meet for humanitarian parole because they are considered case by case .\n\u201c I would recommend , although not required , the more documentation provided the better .\nThat gives a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email added .\nCBP and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to BuzzFeed News \u2019 requests for comment .\nOf the 24 humanitarian parole requests that advocates have submitted in Nogales since August , five have been denied and four granted in the past two weeks , Sachau said .\n\u201c Just because it \u2019 s no longer 0 % doesn \u2019 t mean all the things we laid out in the demand letter aren \u2019 t true , and we still have responses pending , \u201d Sachau said .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow them into the country to seek protection has an 11-year-old daughter who has seizures .",

        "content": "The app claims to rely on science and psychology to help you lose weight .\nBut it may not be that different from any other deprivation diet .\nI keep getting this ad for the Noom app , served up with so many YouTube videos and cable TV shows that I feel uniquely targeted by them .\nIt begins with a supercut of an attractive young man clearing plate after plate at restaurants , waving off waiters while a folksy cover of \u201c Where Is My Mind \u201d by The Pixies plays .\nThen he stares agape at his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks and drinking beer .\n\u201c I was conditioned to finish my plate since childhood ?\n\u201d he says , astonished ; we see a flashback of a kid mopping up the last of an egg while his father glares at him .\n\u201c When it comes to losing weight , it \u2019 s psychological , \u201d the voiceover says .\nThe message : Noom is different .\nIt will help you get thinner the smart way .\nMuch of Noom \u2019 s advertising leans on this \u201c not like the other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet .\nStart going on Noom , \u201d one ad says .\n\u201c The last weight loss program you \u2019 ll ever need , \u201d another says .\nThe people who work there use the same framing .\n\u201c We think of it as a health and wellness tool , \u201d Noom President Artem Petkov told me over Zoom last year .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a psychology-minded type of education .\nIt \u2019 s how you teach people the behavioral science of these things , to empower them .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I google \u201c diet , \u201d the first result is a Noom ad ( your algorithm may vary ) .\nNoom \u2019 s core offering is called Noom Weight , which \u201c empowers participants to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle intervention.\n\u201d One prong is a general \u201c health \u201d program , and there \u2019 s another for those looking to manage their diabetes , but it \u2019 s clear that at least one major purpose of Noom is to help you lose weight \u2014 key elements include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text that emphasizes losing weight .\nNoom says it wants to help you lose weight \u201c sustainably , \u201d meaning gradually , long-term , and through behavioral changes as opposed to rigid rules and elimination diets .\nIn one Noom ad , a woman talks about how she lost 87 pounds , saying that in order to lose the weight , she had to \u2014 and here , she taps on her head \u2014 lose the weight .\n\u201c We consider ourselves to be a digital health platform , \u201d a Noom spokesperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Calling Noom a diet is like calling a car an engine or a ship a sail \u2014 it \u2019 s a part of the vehicle but not the whole picture.\n\u201d ( Noom also has a newer offering called Noom Mood , designed to \u201c help you develop the techniques , emotional awareness and resilience to reduce stress and live a happier life.\n\u201d ) Noom does differ from its competitors in two ways .\nFirst , its novel app-based approach explains the \u201c psychology \u201d of what you \u2019 re choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating , and when you \u2019 re eating .\n\u201c We use gold-standard principles from psychology ( CBT , ACT , DBT , etc . )\nto help users understand why they should and how they can create healthier behaviors \u2014 not just what to eat , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me via email .\nThe goal is to teach your brain to overcome bad habits and unnecessary calories .\nCravings are contextualized as emotional eating , and emotional eating as conquerable .\nSecond , it \u2019 s much more expensive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership is around $ 60 , while comparable Weight Watchers services , for example , run to about half that price .\nBut none of this really differentiates Noom from the diet programs and apps it seeks to define itself against .\nUltimately , its aims are the same : to help you eat less , so you can weigh less .\nWe might as well get this out of the way : Diets don \u2019 t work .\nIt \u2019 s been proven many , many , many times .\nEven if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short term , you \u2019 re more likely to gain that weight back than to actually keep it off .\nDeprivation diets in particular impact your metabolism , making it even harder to keep that weight off in the future .\n( That \u2019 s why a lot of The Biggest Loser contestants struggle to keep their weight down after they leave the show , which reportedly restricts what they eat to under 1,000 calories a day . )\nBecause of an antiquated idea from the early 1900s , most deprivation diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,500 daily calorie allotment , which is essentially equivalent to the appropriate amount of food for a particularly large dog .\nDiets that require you to cut out entire food groups \u2014 like the keto diet or the Whole30 program \u2014 could fail in similar ways .\nEven if you do lose weight , you \u2019 re unlikely to keep it off , and at worst , your metabolism slows down long term .\nNoom has one other similarity with its competitors : Its approach suggests that losing weight is simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily true .\nPsychology is just one influence , because biochemistry , genetics , and environment play a role too .\nThe way Noom sees it , cravings and caloric needs beyond its guidelines are compulsions that your mind can crush .\nBut do understanding and modifying your thoughts really help if you live in a food desert ?\nCan you mind over matter yourself out of starvation mode while eating far less than what your body actually requires to function optimally ?\nPerhaps the most significant difference is really Noom \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached beyond the traditional weight-loss audience of women to also target men .\nNoom ads feature a lot of men , and the app seems to have a higher percentage of male users than others in its category .\n( When asked , Noom would not confirm their user demographics . )\nUnlike wellness and diet programs marketed to women ( like Gwyneth Paltrow \u2019 s juice cleanse routine ) , which are usually promoted using the flowery language of self-care and beach-body imagery , Noom presents itself as rooted in science .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard facts .\nIt \u2019 s a diet app that \u2019 s dressed up in a therapist \u2019 s blazer and slacks , giving you advice on how to change for the \u201c better , \u201d telling you that if only you could just get out of your own way , you could do the impossible and make this diet work for the rest of your life .\nIt \u2019 s not like Noom invented the idea of men dieting .\nKeto-based plans are often marketed to men and 10 % of Weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 11th century , William the Conqueror lost weight by going on a liquid diet of nothing but alcohol and became thin enough to resume riding his beloved horse .\n( In 1087 , though , he died in a riding accident . )\nIn the \u2018 50s , people started drinking apple cider vinegar to stay thin , something that Lord Byron did in the 19th century .\nAnd in the \u2018 60s , \u201c The Drinking Man \u2019 s Diet \u201d was introduced , advising men to drink as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while eating fish and steak .\nIn 2019 , the diet market reached a record $ 78 billion in the US alone ( there was a small decline in 2020 because of the pandemic ) .\nAnd the male weight-loss market is steadily growing ; for the last decade , Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig have seemingly also been refocusing some of their energy to capture the male market .\nIn 2018 , Atkins brought in Rob Lowe \u2014 their first male spokesperson \u2014 to promote their products to other men .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Noom is right at the top , promising to change your life in just 16 weeks .\nNoom was founded in 2008 , the brainchild of 42-year-old Saeju Jeong , who came up with the idea after his father died of lung cancer 20 years ago .\nRaised in South Korea , Jeong started his first business \u2014 a record label \u2014 at 19 before moving to the US in 2005 and launching the app in 2016 .\n\u201c We want to help many lives , as many as we can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in an interview last year .\n\u201c Weight management is the most effective and efficient way to deliver health .\nIt \u2019 s simple .\nIt \u2019 s powerful.\n\u201d 14 years later , Noom is generating $ 400 million in revenue and is gearing up for a $ 10 billion valuation once it launches an IPO , which could happen this year or in early 2023 .\nThe diet industry has changed significantly in the last few years , turning away from promoting weight loss and toward \u201c wellness.\n\u201d If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restrictive program used to lose weight , then the language of wellness is often employed for a softer , gentler approach .\nWeight Watchers is now called WW , sometimes referred to as WellnessWins .\nThe low-carb Atkins diet is now about \u201c a life well lived , \u201d and Jenny Craig \u2019 s site has a Healthy Habits section with suggestions that go beyond weight loss .\nBy also co-opting the language of wellness , Noom has effectively captured people \u2019 s attention \u2014 the app reportedly has 50 million users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum have lent high-profile shine as well : \u201c Noom \u2019 s mix of empathetic human support paired with modern technology and science makes it possible for people to achieve significant , lasting behavior change , \u201d Williams said in a 2019 Noom press release .\nBut what anti-diet nutritionists and therapists see are the same old diet culture rules , just wrapped up in a different skin .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a good example of diet culture shape-shifting , \u201d said Evelyn Tribole , a registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intuitive Eating .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve seen Weight Watchers rebrand because they \u2019 re trying to move away from dieting .\nYou can call it whatever you want .\nYou can say you \u2019 re using mindful tools .\nIn the end , when you \u2019 re counting calories and categorizing food and tracking your weight , it \u2019 s a diet.\n\u201d When you give Noom any of your information , it talks back to you like a comforting coach , someone who \u2019 s on your team no matter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate just like a diet , albeit one made to look like a gamified MyFitnessPal .\nThe interface for Noom looks a little like a board game , your marker steadily moving along the path every day you use it .\nThe app quizzes you and rewards you with encouragement when you get the right answers .\nIt gives you the endorphin rush of checking off a box on a to-do list .\nEven before you sign into the app , the Noom website asks a series of questions to hook you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person \u2019 s potential weight loss .\n( Noom claims it can help you lose one to two pounds a week . )\nWhen you respond to a questionnaire that asks about health risks like diabetes or high blood pressure , it coos back , \u201c We \u2019 re really glad you shared .\nWeight loss is an important goal , but Noom \u2019 s mission is helping people get healthier , whatever that is for them.\n\u201d The questionnaire also asks whether you have an \u201c active diagnosis \u201d of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it suggests you talk to a therapist instead of continuing to sign up for Noom . )\nLike many other web-based diet programs or trackers , the Noom app requires you to input all your calories and movements .\nIt categorizes your food : green ( largely fresh fruit and vegetables ) , yellow ( lean meats and dairy ) , and red ( desserts , saturated fats ) .\nYour green allotment is limitless , while just a couple hundred calories of red is permitted a day .\nWhen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirps back , \u201c Great choice \u2014 Enjoy !\n\u201d but red foods come with the warning , \u201c Limit your portions.\n\u201d ( Calorie counts for each category are listed in small print . )\nYou \u2019 re prompted to weigh yourself daily so the app can track your \u201c progress.\n\u201d If you forget to log into the app for more than a day or two , you \u2019 re sent a text to remind you to get back in there .\nThe app assigns you daily tasks , like reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more \u201c mindful \u201d when you \u2019 re stress-eating .\nYou also get a series of motivational sticky notes that say things like , \u201c Stop saying I wish .\nStart saying I will , \u201d and \u201c Great things never come from comfort zones.\n\u201d Another day , it \u2019 ll present you with a PowerPoint-like presentation featuring the definition for metacognition , \u201c a fancy psych term that describes an awareness and understanding of one \u2019 s thoughts and thought processes.\n\u201d You are told to \u201c embrace \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noom assigns each user a coach to work with one-on-one \u2014 the company employs 3,000 coaches across the country , all trained as dieticians , psychologists , or therapists \u2014 as well as a support group , where users can keep each other on track .\n\u201c We have a lot of customers who might not get the weight loss that they want to get , but what we hear all the time is , \u2018 I feel different as a person , \u2019 \u201d Andreas Michaelides , chief of psychology at Noom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 I have a different relationship with food .\nI have a different relationship with my body.\n\u2019 \u201d But the psychological element is exactly what may make Noom potentially harmful .\nWhen you fail at Noom , you don \u2019 t just fail the way you might fail a typical diet \u2014 physically , because your body needs more food or is craving calories or comfort \u2014 but you also fail psychologically .\nBoth Tribole and her Intuitive Eating coauthor , nutrition therapist Elyse Resch , have had clients who have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complicated relationship with food .\n\u201c It becomes a mindfuck for our patients , because they think , Oh my god , I tried the psychology and it doesn \u2019 t work , \u201d Tribole said .\nAnd as with other diets , it seems inevitable that many users will fail Noom \u2019 s program .\n\u201c They \u2019 re telling you it could be mind over matter , but it \u2019 s not possible .\nThe survival part of the brain is going to do whatever it can to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can learn how to have power over [ other habits ] but not something that \u2019 s so physiological and neurochemical .\nYou can not overcome that unless you \u2019 re priming yourself for a very serious eating disorder.\n\u201d \u201c This has an impact , causing food obsessionality , food worry , food anxiety , feeling like you \u2019 re lost , out of control eating , \u201d Tribole said .\nShe likened a diet to being pulled underwater by an ocean \u2019 s riptides .\n\u201c When a big set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you hold your breath .\nWhen you come back up , you can take a big breath : ahhhh .\nNo one denigrates you , Oh my god , you \u2019 re addicted to air .\nThis is what happens when you restrict your eating below what your body needs it to be .\nYou \u2019 re going to be gasping for food.\n\u201d I tried Noom twice , and both times I failed .\nI lost a little weight , but not much \u2014 the app told me to consume just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nearly enough for my 5-foot-5-inch frame .\nI binged every night ; I felt like a failure .\nBut Noom considers failing a part of the process .\n\u201c The psychological tools we teach are geared towards a holistic understanding of how people can use their self-awareness to change any type of behavior , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me .\n\u201c We hear many instances of people who might not lose the amount of weight they wanted when they came into the program but leave with a great deal of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-compassion.\n\u201d Using these apps is different for everyone , and some people I spoke to did have success losing weight .\nBut others said they had trouble like I did , which impacted their sense of self-worth .\n\u201c When I joined Noom , I was probably at my leanest and strongest .\nPhysically , I was my most capable , \u201d said Kate ( who asked to be identified by a pseudonym ) , a 27-year-old woman who tried Noom in 2019 .\n\u201c Once I got on Noom and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deteriorated .\nIt overpowered how strong I felt in my body .\nThose weigh-ins definitely messed with my head.\n\u201d The dozens of women I spoke to about Noom had some version of this story : They joined the app to lose that last 10 pounds , or to work on their relationship with food , and were instead rattled by the weigh-ins and the tight calorie count ( \u201c Almonds are a red food , \u201d Kate said , incredulous ) .\nThey also didn \u2019 t find the psychological element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raised in some form of diet culture , meaning that they already knew some of Noom \u2019 s tips \u2014 like taking a sip of water between bites to slow you down \u2014 and decided the app might not be worth $ 60 a month .\n\u201c [ It \u2019 s ] mental gymnastics and rhetorical pretzel-twisting to say this isn \u2019 t about weight , it \u2019 s about psychology , \u201d Christy Harrison , registered dietician and author of Anti-Diet , said .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen Noom try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the numbers and you \u2019 re not a failure if your weight doesn \u2019 t change , but how does that square with making people weigh themselves every day , and using a traffic light system to categorize foods ?\nOf course that creates a sense of good and bad foods.\n\u201d Even the app \u2019 s framing of how you eat can feel weaponized .\nTake , for example , the way Noom talks about cravings , describing them as an \u201c inner elephant , \u201d an \u201c impulsive , irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tame your elephant , to make it behave .\nBut that really means you should behave .\n\u201c The emotional eating piece really gets to me , the way it demonizes emotional eating , meanwhile creating the conditions for it to happen , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c Of course you \u2019 re going to feel so deprived after a few days or weeks of a 1,200 calorie diet .\nI would be crawling out of my skin.\n\u201d Also : an elephant ?\nReally ?\nCome on .\nNoom \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in the context of the male-dominated trends of bio-hacking and self-optimization .\nLast year , former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed to follow one of the most horrific diets I \u2019 ve ever heard of : one meal per weekday , and a full weekend of fasting .\n( This is a version of intermittent fasting \u2014 which is usually a 16-hour fast , or one 24-hour fast a week , and not two full days of starvation , which is an unhealthy routine . )\nThere are fasting clubs in Silicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and step with interactive watches and rings , and a lot of those devices are targeted specifically to men looking to optimize their bodies and brains .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not quite as extreme as Jack Dorsey \u2019 s intermittent fasting thing , but it \u2019 s still this instrumentalization of your relationship with food , putting it into the realm of intellect and numbers and apps , \u201d Harrison said of Noom \u2019 s method .\n\u201c I have seen men for whom Noom was the trigger \u2014 it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of severely disordered eating.\n\u201d Men make up around 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 cases of eating disorders , but many of them rarely get treatment .\nThe app might also speak to men because they are traditionally not very practiced in talking about their feelings , especially around food , and Noom seemingly provides a space to do so , or at least think about food a little differently .\n\u201c Often men have a harder time accessing their feelings and acknowledging that they have eating issues , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along so maybe their brains find that more accessible.\n\u201d For men , longstanding diet tips might actually feel new \u2014 especially because Noom presents them as digestible factoids .\nFor example , for every calorie you burn , you get half a calorie back for your food intake .\nNoom explains it thusly : \u201c When you create a calorie deficit , you \u2019 ll lose more weight .\nIt \u2019 s math .\nAnd science.\n\u201d \u201c It has that sciency veneer , the emphasis on psychology .\nThis is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , that speaks to men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s funny how common those diet rules are for women.\n\u201d For men , meanwhile , those rules are framed as brand new , and much more revelatory for their eating habits .\nNone of the men I spoke to said they were unhappy with the app .\n32-year-old Alex Thibodeau told me he has been using the app for around four months \u2014 he started after getting targeted ads on Instagram \u2014 and said he had lost around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me to sign up for it was the alleged promise of it being psychological , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They make using their app habitual .\nThe prompting they do keeps you addicted .\nIt makes me feel more accountable.\n\u201d Thibodeau said his progress on Noom has plateaued , but felt this was more to do with him than the app \u2019 s failings .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t feel as though it was a scam in the way that I feel a lot of apps tend to overpromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The shortcomings I \u2019 ve experienced with it are more to do with my lack of interest than the effectiveness of the app.\n\u201d ( Tribole said that was another unique characteristic of diets .\n\u201c [ Dieting ] is the only industry that blames the consumer , and the consumer believes it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s gaslighting 101.\n\u201d ) For 55-year-old Chris McNaught , it \u2019 s not the theory so much as the accountability element that has proved useful .\nMcNaught said he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\n( He regained 20 pounds after quitting the app , and has since rejoined . )\n\u201c I \u2019 m actually a licensed professional counselor , \u201d he said .\n\u201c [ Noom ] hasn \u2019 t taught me anything I didn \u2019 t already know , but they put it in concrete terms for me , why I think about food the way I do and the habits I repeat.\n\u201d McNaught said that Noom helped him break one of his unhealthy eating habits , namely going to Sonic after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t hungry .\n\u2018 That was one of my \u2018 fog \u2019 eating scripts , \u201d he said , using Noom \u2019 s term for consuming food when \u201c not fully present.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 m just trying to establish a new normal .\nI \u2019 m not going to be on Noom forever.\n\u201d At 5 feet , 10 inches , Thibodeau was told by the app to eat around 1,900 calories a day .\nMcNaught , at 6 feet , was told to eat just 1,500 calories .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around 5 feet , 7 inches or taller ) reported that they were told to consume between 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day .\nThis , simply put , is not enough .\n( When I asked Noom if they considered this amount of food sufficient for adult men , they said yes .\n\u201c There are a variety of inputs that get individuals to a recommended calorie goal \u2014 all based on safe and scientifically-proven research , \u201d a spokesperson said .\n\u201c Noom \u2019 s calorie budget is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and users have the option to manually adjust their goal.\n\u201d ) According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , intake for men should generally range between 2,400 to 3,000 calories a day .\n\u201c This is ridiculous , \u201d Resch said .\n\u201c They will feel starved on this calorie allotment.\n\u201d Resch mentioned the 1944 Minnesota Starvation Experiment , where men spent three months eating a diet of 3,200 calories a day , followed by six months of 1,570 calories a day ( split into breakfast and lunch ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamina , body temperature , heart rate , and sex drive .\nThe men became obsessed with food , fantasizing about it , becoming more depressed and irritable as time went on .\nMen may be an important market for Noom and its competitors because women are starting to diet less .\nOver the last three decades , fewer people have been dieting in general , but women are leading the charge against traditional diet programs .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this growing movement towards body positivity , weight inclusivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold for women and also trans folks and marginalized folks , a little more so than [ for ] cis straight white men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c The diet industry in general , and maybe Noom in particular , is looking to expand their market base.\n\u201d Last week , a friend who lives on the West Coast texted me from his parents \u2019 house .\nHe \u2019 d seen that ubiquitous Noom ad while watching sports on TV .\nHe was surprised \u2014 when was the last time he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe funny thing about that ad , which features the man finishing his meal , is that it focuses more on how he eats all his food than why he originally felt obligated to eat everything on it .\nThe way his dad glares at him while he does it is striking .\nHow did his father make him feel about not finishing his plate , or conversely , about eating \u201c too much \u201d ?\nWhat kind of psychological trauma might be tied up between him and his relationship with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play if someone is eating beyond satiety or undereating , if someone \u2019 s relationship with food is fraught and painful and demoralizing .\nWhich is what makes Noom so frustrating for some people .\nThe point of Noom , like most wellness-based diet programs , is still to get you to lose weight .\nAnd just because you \u2019 re using psychological tools in hopes of reshaping your brain into eating less food , less frequently , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that those are healthy habits .\nKnowing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain way doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re bound to change in a holistic , healthy way .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t have to track their calorie count , their exercise , label foods , weigh themselves every day , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u2018 There \u2019 s another way to live , beyond all this obsession.\n\u201d \u25cf If you \u2019 re dealing with an eating disorder and need someone to talk to , the National Eating Disorders Association helpline is 1-800-931-2237 ; for 24/7 crisis support , text \u201c @ @ @ @ @",

        "content": "The app claims to rely on science and psychology to help you lose weight .\nBut it may not be that different from any other deprivation diet .\nI keep getting this ad for the Noom app , served up with so many YouTube videos and cable TV shows that I feel uniquely targeted by them .\nIt begins with a supercut of an attractive young man clearing plate after plate at restaurants , waving off waiters while a folksy cover of \u201c Where Is My Mind \u201d by The Pixies plays .\nThen he stares agape at his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks and drinking beer .\n\u201c I was conditioned to finish my plate since childhood ?\n\u201d he says , astonished ; we see a flashback of a kid mopping up the last of an egg while his father glares at him .\n\u201c When it comes to losing weight , it \u2019 s psychological , \u201d the voiceover says .\nThe message : Noom is different .\nIt will help you get thinner the smart way .\nMuch of Noom \u2019 s advertising leans on this \u201c not like the other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet .\nStart going on Noom , \u201d one ad says .\n\u201c The last weight loss program you \u2019 ll ever need , \u201d another says .\nThe people who work there use the same framing .\n\u201c We think of it as a health and wellness tool , \u201d Noom President Artem Petkov told me over Zoom last year .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a psychology-minded type of education .\nIt \u2019 s how you teach people the behavioral science of these things , to empower them .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I google \u201c diet , \u201d the first result is a Noom ad ( your algorithm may vary ) .\nNoom \u2019 s core offering is called Noom Weight , which \u201c empowers participants to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle intervention.\n\u201d One prong is a general \u201c health \u201d program , and there \u2019 s another for those looking to manage their diabetes , but it \u2019 s clear that at least one major purpose of Noom is to help you lose weight \u2014 key elements include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text that emphasizes losing weight .\nNoom says it wants to help you lose weight \u201c sustainably , \u201d meaning gradually , long-term , and through behavioral changes as opposed to rigid rules and elimination diets .\nIn one Noom ad , a woman talks about how she lost 87 pounds , saying that in order to lose the weight , she had to \u2014 and here , she taps on her head \u2014 lose the weight .\n\u201c We consider ourselves to be a digital health platform , \u201d a Noom spokesperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Calling Noom a diet is like calling a car an engine or a ship a sail \u2014 it \u2019 s a part of the vehicle but not the whole picture.\n\u201d ( Noom also has a newer offering called Noom Mood , designed to \u201c help you develop the techniques , emotional awareness and resilience to reduce stress and live a happier life.\n\u201d ) Noom does differ from its competitors in two ways .\nFirst , its novel app-based approach explains the \u201c psychology \u201d of what you \u2019 re choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating , and when you \u2019 re eating .\n\u201c We use gold-standard principles from psychology ( CBT , ACT , DBT , etc . )\nto help users understand why they should and how they can create healthier behaviors \u2014 not just what to eat , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me via email .\nThe goal is to teach your brain to overcome bad habits and unnecessary calories .\nCravings are contextualized as emotional eating , and emotional eating as conquerable .\nSecond , it \u2019 s much more expensive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership is around $ 60 , while comparable Weight Watchers services , for example , run to about half that price .\nBut none of this really differentiates Noom from the diet programs and apps it seeks to define itself against .\nUltimately , its aims are the same : to help you eat less , so you can weigh less .\nWe might as well get this out of the way : Diets don \u2019 t work .\nIt \u2019 s been proven many , many , many times .\nEven if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short term , you \u2019 re more likely to gain that weight back than to actually keep it off .\nDeprivation diets in particular impact your metabolism , making it even harder to keep that weight off in the future .\n( That \u2019 s why a lot of The Biggest Loser contestants struggle to keep their weight down after they leave the show , which reportedly restricts what they eat to under 1,000 calories a day . )\nBecause of an antiquated idea from the early 1900s , most deprivation diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,500 daily calorie allotment , which is essentially equivalent to the appropriate amount of food for a particularly large dog .\nDiets that require you to cut out entire food groups \u2014 like the keto diet or the Whole30 program \u2014 could fail in similar ways .\nEven if you do lose weight , you \u2019 re unlikely to keep it off , and at worst , your metabolism slows down long term .\nNoom has one other similarity with its competitors : Its approach suggests that losing weight is simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily true .\nPsychology is just one influence , because biochemistry , genetics , and environment play a role too .\nThe way Noom sees it , cravings and caloric needs beyond its guidelines are compulsions that your mind can crush .\nBut do understanding and modifying your thoughts really help if you live in a food desert ?\nCan you mind over matter yourself out of starvation mode while eating far less than what your body actually requires to function optimally ?\nPerhaps the most significant difference is really Noom \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached beyond the traditional weight-loss audience of women to also target men .\nNoom ads feature a lot of men , and the app seems to have a higher percentage of male users than others in its category .\n( When asked , Noom would not confirm their user demographics . )\nUnlike wellness and diet programs marketed to women ( like Gwyneth Paltrow \u2019 s juice cleanse routine ) , which are usually promoted using the flowery language of self-care and beach-body imagery , Noom presents itself as rooted in science .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard facts .\nIt \u2019 s a diet app that \u2019 s dressed up in a therapist \u2019 s blazer and slacks , giving you advice on how to change for the \u201c better , \u201d telling you that if only you could just get out of your own way , you could do the impossible and make this diet work for the rest of your life .\nIt \u2019 s not like Noom invented the idea of men dieting .\nKeto-based plans are often marketed to men and 10 % of Weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 11th century , William the Conqueror lost weight by going on a liquid diet of nothing but alcohol and became thin enough to resume riding his beloved horse .\n( In 1087 , though , he died in a riding accident . )\nIn the \u2018 50s , people started drinking apple cider vinegar to stay thin , something that Lord Byron did in the 19th century .\nAnd in the \u2018 60s , \u201c The Drinking Man \u2019 s Diet \u201d was introduced , advising men to drink as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while eating fish and steak .\nIn 2019 , the diet market reached a record $ 78 billion in the US alone ( there was a small decline in 2020 because of the pandemic ) .\nAnd the male weight-loss market is steadily growing ; for the last decade , Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig have seemingly also been refocusing some of their energy to capture the male market .\nIn 2018 , Atkins brought in Rob Lowe \u2014 their first male spokesperson \u2014 to promote their products to other men .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Noom is right at the top , promising to change your life in just 16 weeks .\nNoom was founded in 2008 , the brainchild of 42-year-old Saeju Jeong , who came up with the idea after his father died of lung cancer 20 years ago .\nRaised in South Korea , Jeong started his first business \u2014 a record label \u2014 at 19 before moving to the US in 2005 and launching the app in 2016 .\n\u201c We want to help many lives , as many as we can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in an interview last year .\n\u201c Weight management is the most effective and efficient way to deliver health .\nIt \u2019 s simple .\nIt \u2019 s powerful.\n\u201d 14 years later , Noom is generating $ 400 million in revenue and is gearing up for a $ 10 billion valuation once it launches an IPO , which could happen this year or in early 2023 .\nThe diet industry has changed significantly in the last few years , turning away from promoting weight loss and toward \u201c wellness.\n\u201d If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restrictive program used to lose weight , then the language of wellness is often employed for a softer , gentler approach .\nWeight Watchers is now called WW , sometimes referred to as WellnessWins .\nThe low-carb Atkins diet is now about \u201c a life well lived , \u201d and Jenny Craig \u2019 s site has a Healthy Habits section with suggestions that go beyond weight loss .\nBy also co-opting the language of wellness , Noom has effectively captured people \u2019 s attention \u2014 the app reportedly has 50 million users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum have lent high-profile shine as well : \u201c Noom \u2019 s mix of empathetic human support paired with modern technology and science makes it possible for people to achieve significant , lasting behavior change , \u201d Williams said in a 2019 Noom press release .\nBut what anti-diet nutritionists and therapists see are the same old diet culture rules , just wrapped up in a different skin .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a good example of diet culture shape-shifting , \u201d said Evelyn Tribole , a registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intuitive Eating .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve seen Weight Watchers rebrand because they \u2019 re trying to move away from dieting .\nYou can call it whatever you want .\nYou can say you \u2019 re using mindful tools .\nIn the end , when you \u2019 re counting calories and categorizing food and tracking your weight , it \u2019 s a diet.\n\u201d When you give Noom any of your information , it talks back to you like a comforting coach , someone who \u2019 s on your team no matter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate just like a diet , albeit one made to look like a gamified MyFitnessPal .\nThe interface for Noom looks a little like a board game , your marker steadily moving along the path every day you use it .\nThe app quizzes you and rewards you with encouragement when you get the right answers .\nIt gives you the endorphin rush of checking off a box on a to-do list .\nEven before you sign into the app , the Noom website asks a series of questions to hook you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person \u2019 s potential weight loss .\n( Noom claims it can help you lose one to two pounds a week . )\nWhen you respond to a questionnaire that asks about health risks like diabetes or high blood pressure , it coos back , \u201c We \u2019 re really glad you shared .\nWeight loss is an important goal , but Noom \u2019 s mission is helping people get healthier , whatever that is for them.\n\u201d The questionnaire also asks whether you have an \u201c active diagnosis \u201d of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it suggests you talk to a therapist instead of continuing to sign up for Noom . )\nLike many other web-based diet programs or trackers , the Noom app requires you to input all your calories and movements .\nIt categorizes your food : green ( largely fresh fruit and vegetables ) , yellow ( lean meats and dairy ) , and red ( desserts , saturated fats ) .\nYour green allotment is limitless , while just a couple hundred calories of red is permitted a day .\nWhen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirps back , \u201c Great choice \u2014 Enjoy !\n\u201d but red foods come with the warning , \u201c Limit your portions.\n\u201d ( Calorie counts for each category are listed in small print . )\nYou \u2019 re prompted to weigh yourself daily so the app can track your \u201c progress.\n\u201d If you forget to log into the app for more than a day or two , you \u2019 re sent a text to remind you to get back in there .\nThe app assigns you daily tasks , like reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more \u201c mindful \u201d when you \u2019 re stress-eating .\nYou also get a series of motivational sticky notes that say things like , \u201c Stop saying I wish .\nStart saying I will , \u201d and \u201c Great things never come from comfort zones.\n\u201d Another day , it \u2019 ll present you with a PowerPoint-like presentation featuring the definition for metacognition , \u201c a fancy psych term that describes an awareness and understanding of one \u2019 s thoughts and thought processes.\n\u201d You are told to \u201c embrace \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noom offers an option of working one-on-one with a coach \u2014 the company employs 3,000 coaches across the country , all trained as dieticians , psychologists , or therapists \u2014 as well as a support group , where users can keep each other on track .\n\u201c We have a lot of customers who might not get the weight loss that they want to get , but what we hear all the time is , \u2018 I feel different as a person , \u2019 \u201d Andreas Michaelides , chief of psychology at Noom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 I have a different relationship with food .\nI have a different relationship with my body.\n\u2019 \u201d But the psychological element is exactly what may make Noom potentially harmful .\nWhen you fail at Noom , you don \u2019 t just fail the way you might fail a typical diet \u2014 physically , because your body needs more food or is craving calories or comfort \u2014 but you also fail psychologically .\nBoth Tribole and her Intuitive Eating coauthor , nutrition therapist Elyse Resch , have had clients who have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complicated relationship with food .\n\u201c It becomes a mindfuck for our patients , because they think , Oh my god , I tried the psychology and it doesn \u2019 t work , \u201d Tribole said .\nAnd as with other diets , it seems inevitable that many users will fail Noom \u2019 s program .\n\u201c They \u2019 re telling you it could be mind over matter , but it \u2019 s not possible .\nThe survival part of the brain is going to do whatever it can to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can learn how to have power over [ other habits ] but not something that \u2019 s so physiological and neurochemical .\nYou can not overcome that unless you \u2019 re priming yourself for a very serious eating disorder.\n\u201d \u201c This has an impact , causing food obsessionality , food worry , food anxiety , feeling like you \u2019 re lost , out of control eating , \u201d Tribole said .\nShe likened a diet to being pulled underwater by an ocean \u2019 s riptides .\n\u201c When a big set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you hold your breath .\nWhen you come back up , you can take a big breath : ahhhh .\nNo one denigrates you , Oh my god , you \u2019 re addicted to air .\nThis is what happens when you restrict your eating below what your body needs it to be .\nYou \u2019 re going to be gasping for food.\n\u201d I tried Noom twice , and both times I failed .\nI lost a little weight , but not much \u2014 the app told me to consume just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nearly enough for my 5-foot-5-inch frame .\nI binged every night ; I felt like a failure .\nBut Noom considers failing a part of the process .\n\u201c The psychological tools we teach are geared towards a holistic understanding of how people can use their self-awareness to change any type of behavior , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me .\n\u201c We hear many instances of people who might not lose the amount of weight they wanted when they came into the program but leave with a great deal of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-compassion.\n\u201d Using these apps is different for everyone , and some people I spoke to did have success losing weight .\nBut others said they had trouble like I did , which impacted their sense of self-worth .\n\u201c When I joined Noom , I was probably at my leanest and strongest .\nPhysically , I was my most capable , \u201d said Kate ( who asked to be identified by a pseudonym ) , a 27-year-old woman who tried Noom in 2019 .\n\u201c Once I got on Noom and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deteriorated .\nIt overpowered how strong I felt in my body .\nThose weigh-ins definitely messed with my head.\n\u201d The dozens of women I spoke to about Noom had some version of this story : They joined the app to lose that last 10 pounds , or to work on their relationship with food , and were instead rattled by the weigh-ins and the tight calorie count ( \u201c Almonds are a red food , \u201d Kate said , incredulous ) .\nThey also didn \u2019 t find the psychological element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raised in some form of diet culture , meaning that they already knew some of Noom \u2019 s tips \u2014 like taking a sip of water between bites to slow you down \u2014 and decided the app might not be worth $ 60 a month .\n\u201c [ It \u2019 s ] mental gymnastics and rhetorical pretzel-twisting to say this isn \u2019 t about weight , it \u2019 s about psychology , \u201d Christy Harrison , registered dietician and author of Anti-Diet , said .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen Noom try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the numbers and you \u2019 re not a failure if your weight doesn \u2019 t change , but how does that square with making people weigh themselves every day , and using a traffic light system to categorize foods ?\nOf course that creates a sense of good and bad foods.\n\u201d Even the app \u2019 s framing of how you eat can feel weaponized .\nTake , for example , the way Noom talks about cravings , describing them as an \u201c inner elephant , \u201d an \u201c impulsive , irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tame your elephant , to make it behave .\nBut that really means you should behave .\n\u201c The emotional eating piece really gets to me , the way it demonizes emotional eating , meanwhile creating the conditions for it to happen , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c Of course you \u2019 re going to feel so deprived after a few days or weeks of a 1,200 calorie diet .\nI would be crawling out of my skin.\n\u201d Also : an elephant ?\nReally ?\nCome on .\nNoom \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in the context of the male-dominated trends of bio-hacking and self-optimization .\nLast year , former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed to follow one of the most horrific diets I \u2019 ve ever heard of : one meal per weekday , and a full weekend of fasting .\n( This is a version of intermittent fasting \u2014 which is usually a 16-hour fast , or one 24-hour fast a week , and not two full days of starvation , which is an unhealthy routine . )\nThere are fasting clubs in Silicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and step with interactive watches and rings , and a lot of those devices are targeted specifically to men looking to optimize their bodies and brains .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not quite as extreme as Jack Dorsey \u2019 s intermittent fasting thing , but it \u2019 s still this instrumentalization of your relationship with food , putting it into the realm of intellect and numbers and apps , \u201d Harrison said of Noom \u2019 s method .\n\u201c I have seen men for whom Noom was the trigger \u2014 it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of severely disordered eating.\n\u201d Men make up around 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 cases of eating disorders , but many of them rarely get treatment .\nThe app might also speak to men because they are traditionally not very practiced in talking about their feelings , especially around food , and Noom seemingly provides a space to do so , or at least think about food a little differently .\n\u201c Often men have a harder time accessing their feelings and acknowledging that they have eating issues , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along so maybe their brains find that more accessible.\n\u201d For men , longstanding diet tips might actually feel new \u2014 especially because Noom presents them as digestible factoids .\nFor example , for every calorie you burn , you get half a calorie back for your food intake .\nNoom explains it thusly : \u201c When you create a calorie deficit , you \u2019 ll lose more weight .\nIt \u2019 s math .\nAnd science.\n\u201d \u201c It has that sciency veneer , the emphasis on psychology .\nThis is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , that speaks to men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s funny how common those diet rules are for women.\n\u201d For men , meanwhile , those rules are framed as brand new , and much more revelatory for their eating habits .\nNone of the men I spoke to said they were unhappy with the app .\n32-year-old Alex Thibodeau told me he has been

being psychological , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They make using their app habitual .\nThe prompting they do keeps you addicted .\nIt makes me feel more accountable.\n\u201d Thibodeau said his progress on Noom has plateaued , but felt this was more to do with him than the app \u2019 s failings .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t feel as though it was a scam in the way that I feel a lot of apps tend to overpromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The shortcomings I \u2019 ve experienced with it are more to do with my lack of interest than the effectiveness of the app.\n\u201d ( Tribole said that was another unique characteristic of diets .\n\u201c [ Dieting ] is the only industry that blames the consumer , and the consumer believes it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s gaslighting 101.\n\u201d ) For 55-year-old Chris McNaught , it \u2019 s not the theory so much as the accountability element that has proved useful .\nMcNaught said he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\n( He regained 20 pounds after quitting the app , and has since rejoined . )\n\u201c I \u2019 m actually a licensed professional counselor , \u201d he said .\n\u201c [ Noom ] hasn \u2019 t taught me anything I didn \u2019 t already know , but they put it in concrete terms for me , why I think about food the way I do and the habits I repeat.\n\u201d McNaught said that Noom helped him break one of his unhealthy eating habits , namely going to Sonic after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t hungry .\n\u2018 That was one of my \u2018 fog \u2019 eating scripts , \u201d he said , using Noom \u2019 s term for consuming food when \u201c not fully present.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 m just trying to establish a new normal .\nI \u2019 m not going to be on Noom forever.\n\u201d At 5 feet , 10 inches , Thibodeau was told by the app to eat around 1,900 calories a day .\nMcNaught , at 6 feet , was told to eat just 1,500 calories .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around 5 feet , 7 inches or taller ) reported that they were told to consume between 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day .\nThis , simply put , is not enough .\n( When I asked Noom if they considered this amount of food sufficient for adult men , they said yes .\n\u201c There are a variety of inputs that get individuals to a recommended calorie goal \u2014 all based on safe and scientifically-proven research , \u201d a spokesperson said .\n\u201c Noom \u2019 s calorie budget is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and users have the option to manually adjust their goal.\n\u201d ) According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , intake for men should generally range between 2,400 to 3,000 calories a day .\n\u201c This is ridiculous , \u201d Resch said .\n\u201c They will feel starved on this calorie allotment.\n\u201d Resch mentioned the 1944 Minnesota Starvation Experiment , where men spent three months eating a diet of 3,200 calories a day , followed by six months of 1,570 calories a day ( split into breakfast and lunch ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamina , body temperature , heart rate , and sex drive .\nThe men became obsessed with food , fantasizing about it , becoming more depressed and irritable as time went on .\nMen may be an important market for Noom and its competitors because women are starting to diet less .\nOver the last three decades , fewer people have been dieting in general , but women are leading the charge against traditional diet programs .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this growing movement towards body positivity , weight inclusivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold for women and also trans folks and marginalized folks , a little more so than [ for ] cis straight white men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c The diet industry in general , and maybe Noom in particular , is looking to expand their market base.\n\u201d Last week , a friend who lives on the West Coast texted me from his parents \u2019 house .\nHe \u2019 d seen that ubiquitous Noom ad while watching sports on TV .\nHe was surprised \u2014 when was the last time he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe funny thing about that ad , which features the man finishing his meal , is that it focuses more on how he eats all his food than why he originally felt obligated to eat everything on it .\nThe way his dad glares at him while he does it is striking .\nHow did his father make him feel about not finishing his plate , or conversely , about eating \u201c too much \u201d ?\nWhat kind of psychological trauma might be tied up between him and his relationship with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play if someone is eating beyond satiety or undereating , if someone \u2019 s relationship with food is fraught and painful and demoralizing .\nWhich is what makes Noom so frustrating for some people .\nThe point of Noom , like most wellness-based diet programs , is still to get you to lose weight .\nAnd just because you \u2019 re using psychological tools in hopes of reshaping your brain into eating less food , less frequently , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that those are healthy habits .\nKnowing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain way doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re bound to change in a holistic , healthy way .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t have to track their calorie count , their exercise , label foods , weigh themselves every day , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u2018 There \u2019 s another way to live , beyond all this obsession.\n\u201d \u25cf If you \u2019 re dealing with an eating disorder and need someone to talk to , the National Eating Disorders Association helpline is 1-800-931-2237 ; for 24/7 crisis support , text \u201c @ @ @ @ @",

        "content": "The app claims to rely on science and psychology to help you lose weight .\nBut it may not be that different from any other deprivation diet .\nI keep getting this ad for the Noom app , served up with so many YouTube videos and cable TV shows that I feel uniquely targeted by them .\nIt begins with a supercut of an attractive young man clearing plate after plate at restaurants , waving off waiters while a folksy cover of \u201c Where Is My Mind \u201d by The Pixies plays .\nThen he stares agape at his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks and drinking beer .\n\u201c I was conditioned to finish my plate since childhood ?\n\u201d he says , astonished ; we see a flashback of a kid mopping up the last of an egg while his father glares at him .\n\u201c When it comes to losing weight , it \u2019 s psychological , \u201d the voiceover says .\nThe message : Noom is different .\nIt will help you get thinner the smart way .\nMuch of Noom \u2019 s advertising leans on this \u201c not like the other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet .\nStart going on Noom , \u201d one ad says .\n\u201c The last weight loss program you \u2019 ll ever need , \u201d another says .\nThe people who work there use the same framing .\n\u201c We think of it as a health and wellness tool , \u201d Noom President Artem Petkov told me over Zoom last year .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a psychology-minded type of education .\nIt \u2019 s how you teach people the behavioral science of these things , to empower them .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I google \u201c diet , \u201d the first result is a Noom ad ( your algorithm may vary ) .\nNoom \u2019 s core offering is called Noom Weight , which \u201c empowers participants to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle intervention.\n\u201d One prong is a general \u201c health \u201d program , and there \u2019 s another for those looking to manage their diabetes , but it \u2019 s clear that at least one major purpose of Noom is to help you lose weight \u2014 key elements include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text that emphasizes losing weight .\nNoom says it wants to help you lose weight \u201c sustainably , \u201d meaning gradually , long-term , and through behavioral changes as opposed to rigid rules and elimination diets .\nIn one Noom ad , a woman talks about how she lost 87 pounds , saying that in order to lose the weight , she had to \u2014 and here , she taps on her head \u2014 lose the weight .\n\u201c We consider ourselves to be a digital health platform , \u201d a Noom spokesperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Calling Noom a diet is like calling a car an engine or a ship a sail \u2014 it \u2019 s a part of the vehicle but not the whole picture.\n\u201d ( Noom also has a newer offering called Noom Mood , designed to \u201c help you develop the techniques , emotional awareness and resilience to reduce stress and live a happier life.\n\u201d ) Noom does differ from its competitors in two ways .\nFirst , its novel app-based approach explains the \u201c psychology \u201d of what you \u2019 re choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating , and when you \u2019 re eating .\n\u201c We use gold-standard principles from psychology ( CBT , ACT , DBT , etc . )\nto help users understand why they should and how they can create healthier behaviors \u2014 not just what to eat , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me via email .\nThe goal is to teach your brain to overcome bad habits and unnecessary calories .\nCravings are contextualized as emotional eating , and emotional eating as conquerable .\nSecond , it \u2019 s much more expensive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership is around $ 60 , while comparable Weight Watchers services , for example , run to about half that price .\nBut none of this really differentiates Noom from the diet programs and apps it seeks to define itself against .\nUltimately , its aims are the same : to help you eat less , so you can weigh less .\nWe might as well get this out of the way : Diets don \u2019 t work .\nIt \u2019 s been proven many , many , many times .\nEven if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short term , you \u2019 re more likely to gain that weight back than to actually keep it off .\nDeprivation diets in particular impact your metabolism , making it even harder to keep that weight off in the future .\n( That \u2019 s why a lot of The Biggest Loser contestants struggle to keep their weight down after they leave the show , which reportedly restricts what they eat to under 1,000 calories a day . )\nBecause of an antiquated idea from the early 1900s , most deprivation diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,500 daily calorie allotment , which is essentially equivalent to the appropriate amount of food for a particularly large dog .\nDiets that require you to cut out entire food groups \u2014 like the keto diet or the Whole30 program \u2014 could fail in similar ways .\nEven if you do lose weight , you \u2019 re unlikely to keep it off , and at worst , your metabolism slows down long term .\nNoom has one other similarity with its competitors : Its approach suggests that losing weight is simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily true .\nPsychology is just one influence , because biochemistry , genetics , and environment play a role too .\nThe way Noom sees it , cravings and caloric needs beyond its guidelines are compulsions that your mind can crush .\nBut do understanding and modifying your thoughts really help if you live in a food desert ?\nCan you mind over matter yourself out of starvation mode while eating far less than what your body actually requires to function optimally ?\nPerhaps the most significant difference is really Noom \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached beyond the traditional weight-loss audience of women to also target men .\nNoom ads feature a lot of men , and the app seems to have a higher percentage of male users than others in its category .\n( When asked , Noom would not confirm their user demographics . )\nUnlike wellness and diet programs marketed to women ( like Gwyneth Paltrow \u2019 s juice cleanse routine ) , which are usually promoted using the flowery language of self-care and beach-body imagery , Noom presents itself as rooted in science .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard facts .\nIt \u2019 s a diet app that \u2019 s dressed up in a therapist \u2019 s blazer and slacks , giving you advice on how to change for the \u201c better , \u201d telling you that if only you could just get out of your own way , you could do the impossible and make this diet work for the rest of your life .\nIt \u2019 s not like Noom invented the idea of men dieting .\nKeto-based plans are often marketed to men and 10 % of Weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 11th century , William the Conqueror lost weight by going on a liquid diet of nothing but alcohol and became thin enough to resume riding his beloved horse .\n( In 1087 , though , he died in a riding accident . )\nIn the \u2018 50s , people started drinking apple cider vinegar to stay thin , something that Lord Byron did in the 19th century .\nAnd in the \u2018 60s , \u201c The Drinking Man \u2019 s Diet \u201d was introduced , advising men to drink as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while eating fish and steak .\nIn 2019 , the diet market reached a record $ 78 billion in the US alone ( there was a small decline in 2020 because of the pandemic ) .\nAnd the male weight-loss market is steadily growing ; for the last decade , Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig have seemingly also been refocusing some of their energy to capture the male market .\nIn 2018 , Atkins brought in Rob Lowe \u2014 their first male spokesperson \u2014 to promote their products to other men .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Noom is right at the top , promising to change your life in just 16 weeks .\nNoom was founded in 2008 , the brainchild of 42-year-old Saeju Jeong , who came up with the idea after his father died of lung cancer 20 years ago .\nRaised in South Korea , Jeong started his first business \u2014 a record label \u2014 at 19 before moving to the US in 2005 and launching the app in 2016 .\n\u201c We want to help many lives , as many as we can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in an interview last year .\n\u201c Weight management is the most effective and efficient way to deliver health .\nIt \u2019 s simple .\nIt \u2019 s powerful.\n\u201d 14 years later , Noom is generating $ 400 million in revenue and is gearing up for a $ 10 billion valuation once it launches an IPO , which could happen this year or in early 2023 .\nThe diet industry has changed significantly in the last few years , turning away from promoting weight loss and toward \u201c wellness.\n\u201d If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restrictive program used to lose weight , then the language of wellness is often employed for a softer , gentler approach .\nWeight Watchers is now called WW , sometimes referred to as WellnessWins .\nThe low-carb Atkins diet is now about \u201c a life well lived , \u201d and Jenny Craig \u2019 s site has a Healthy Habits section with suggestions that go beyond weight loss .\nBy also co-opting the language of wellness , Noom has effectively captured people \u2019 s attention \u2014 the app reportedly has 50 million users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum have lent high-profile shine as well : \u201c Noom \u2019 s mix of empathetic human support paired with modern technology and science makes it possible for people to achieve significant , lasting behavior change , \u201d Williams said in a 2019 Noom press release .\nBut what anti-diet nutritionists and therapists see are the same old diet culture rules , just wrapped up in a different skin .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a good example of diet culture shape-shifting , \u201d said Evelyn Tribole , a registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intuitive Eating .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve seen Weight Watchers rebrand because they \u2019 re trying to move away from dieting .\nYou can call it whatever you want .\nYou can say you \u2019 re using mindful tools .\nIn the end , when you \u2019 re counting calories and categorizing food and tracking your weight , it \u2019 s a diet.\n\u201d When you give Noom any of your information , it talks back to you like a comforting coach , someone who \u2019 s on your team no matter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate just like a diet , albeit one made to look like a gamified MyFitnessPal .\nThe interface for Noom looks a little like a board game , your marker steadily moving along the path every day you use it .\nThe app quizzes you and rewards you with encouragement when you get the right answers .\nIt gives you the endorphin rush of checking off a box on a to-do list .\nEven before you sign into the app , the Noom website asks a series of questions to hook you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person \u2019 s potential weight loss .\n( Noom claims it can help you lose one to two pounds a week . )\nWhen you respond to a questionnaire that asks about health risks like diabetes or high blood pressure , it coos back , \u201c We \u2019 re really glad you shared .\nWeight loss is an important goal , but Noom \u2019 s mission is helping people get healthier , whatever that is for them.\n\u201d The questionnaire also asks whether you have an \u201c active diagnosis \u201d of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it suggests you talk to a therapist instead of continuing to sign up for Noom . )\nLike many other web-based diet programs or trackers , the Noom app requires you to input all your calories and movements .\nIt categorizes your food : green ( largely fresh fruit and vegetables ) , yellow ( lean meats and dairy ) , and red ( desserts , saturated fats ) .\nYour green allotment is limitless , while just a couple hundred calories of red is permitted a day .\nWhen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirps back , \u201c Great choice \u2014 Enjoy !\n\u201d but red foods come with the warning , \u201c Limit your portions.\n\u201d ( Calorie counts for each category are listed in small print . )\nYou \u2019 re prompted to weigh yourself daily so the app can track your \u201c progress.\n\u201d If you forget to log into the app for more than a day or two , you \u2019 re sent a text to remind you to get back in there .\nThe app assigns you daily tasks , like reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more \u201c mindful \u201d when you \u2019 re stress-eating .\nYou also get a series of motivational sticky notes that say things like , \u201c Stop saying I wish .\nStart saying I will , \u201d and \u201c Great things never come from comfort zones.\n\u201d Another day , it \u2019 ll present you with a PowerPoint-like presentation featuring the definition for metacognition , \u201c a fancy psych term that describes an awareness and understanding of one \u2019 s thoughts and thought processes.\n\u201d You are told to \u201c embrace \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noom offers an option of working one-on-one with a coach \u2014 the company employs 3,000 coaches across the country , all trained as dieticians , psychologists , or therapists \u2014 as well as a support group , where users can keep each other on track .\n\u201c We have a lot of customers who might not get the weight loss that they want to get , but what we hear all the time is , \u2018 I feel different as a person , \u2019 \u201d Andreas Michaelides , chief of psychology at Noom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 I have a different relationship with food .\nI have a different relationship with my body.\n\u2019 \u201d But the psychological element is exactly what may make Noom potentially harmful .\nWhen you fail at Noom , you don \u2019 t just fail the way you might fail a typical diet \u2014 physically , because your body needs more food or is craving calories or comfort \u2014 but you also fail psychologically .\nBoth Tribole and her Intuitive Eating coauthor , nutrition therapist Elyse Resch , have had clients who have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complicated relationship with food .\n\u201c It becomes a mindfuck for our patients , because they think , Oh my god , I tried the psychology and it doesn \u2019 t work , \u201d Tribole said .\nAnd as with other diets , it seems inevitable that many users will fail Noom \u2019 s program .\n\u201c They \u2019 re telling you it could be mind over matter , but it \u2019 s not possible .\nThe survival part of the brain is going to do whatever it can to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can learn how to have power over [ other habits ] but not something that \u2019 s so physiological and neurochemical .\nYou can not overcome that unless you \u2019 re priming yourself for a very serious eating disorder.\n\u201d \u201c This has an impact , causing food obsessionality , food worry , food anxiety , feeling like you \u2019 re lost , out of control eating , \u201d Tribole said .\nShe likened a diet to being pulled underwater by an ocean \u2019 s riptides .\n\u201c When a big set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you hold your breath .\nWhen you come back up , you can take a big breath : ahhhh .\nNo one denigrates you , Oh my god , you \u2019 re addicted to air .\nThis is what happens when you restrict your eating below what your body needs it to be .\nYou \u2019 re going to be gasping for food.\n\u201d I tried Noom twice , and both times I failed .\nI lost a little weight , but not much \u2014 the app told me to consume just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nearly enough for my 5-foot-5-inch frame .\nI binged every night ; I felt like a failure .\nBut Noom considers failing a part of the process .\n\u201c The psychological tools we teach are geared towards a holistic understanding of how people can use their self-awareness to change any type of behavior , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me .\n\u201c We hear many instances of people who might not lose the amount of weight they wanted when they came into the program but leave with a great deal of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-compassion.\n\u201d Using these apps is different for everyone , and some people I spoke to did have success losing weight .\nBut others said they had trouble like I did , which impacted their sense of self-worth .\n\u201c When I joined Noom , I was probably at my leanest and strongest .\nPhysically , I was my most capable , \u201d said Kate ( who asked to be identified by a pseudonym ) , a 27-year-old woman who tried Noom in 2019 .\n\u201c Once I got on Noom and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deteriorated .\nIt overpowered how strong I felt in my body .\nThose weigh-ins definitely messed with my head.\n\u201d The dozens of women I spoke to about Noom had some version of this story : They joined the app to lose that last 10 pounds , or to work on their relationship with food , and were instead rattled by the weigh-ins and the tight calorie count ( \u201c Almonds are a red food , \u201d Kate said , incredulous ) .\nThey also didn \u2019 t find the psychological element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raised in some form of diet culture , meaning that they already knew some of Noom \u2019 s tips \u2014 like taking a sip of water between bites to slow you down \u2014 and decided the app might not be worth $ 60 a month .\n\u201c [ It \u2019 s ] mental gymnastics and rhetorical pretzel-twisting to say this isn \u2019 t about weight , it \u2019 s about psychology , \u201d Christy Harrison , registered dietician and author of Anti-Diet , said .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen Noom try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the numbers and you \u2019 re not a failure if your weight doesn \u2019 t change , but how does that square with making people weigh themselves every day , and using a traffic light system to categorize foods ?\nOf course that creates a sense of good and bad foods.\n\u201d Even the app \u2019 s framing of how you eat can feel weaponized .\nTake , for example , the way Noom talks about cravings , describing them as an \u201c inner elephant , \u201d an \u201c impulsive , irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tame your elephant , to make it behave .\nBut that really means you should behave .\n\u201c The emotional eating piece really gets to me , the way it demonizes emotional eating , meanwhile creating the conditions for it to happen , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c Of course you \u2019 re going to feel so deprived after a few days or weeks of a 1,200 calorie diet .\nI would be crawling out of my skin.\n\u201d Also : an elephant ?\nReally ?\nCome on .\nNoom \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in the context of the male-dominated trends of bio-hacking and self-optimization .\nLast year , former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed to follow one of the most horrific diets I \u2019 ve ever heard of : one meal per weekday , and a full weekend of fasting .\n( This is a version of intermittent fasting \u2014 which is usually a 16-hour fast , or one 24-hour fast a week , and not two full days of starvation , which is an unhealthy routine . )\nThere are fasting clubs in Silicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and step with interactive watches and rings , and a lot of those devices are targeted specifically to men looking to optimize their bodies and brains .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not quite as extreme as Jack Dorsey \u2019 s intermittent fasting thing , but it \u2019 s still this instrumentalization of your relationship with food , putting it into the realm of intellect and numbers and apps , \u201d Harrison said of Noom \u2019 s method .\n\u201c I have seen men for whom Noom was the trigger \u2014 it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of severely disordered eating.\n\u201d Men make up around 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 cases of eating disorders , but many of them rarely get treatment .\nThe app might also speak to men because they are traditionally not very practiced in talking about their feelings , especially around food , and Noom seemingly provides a space to do so , or at least think about food a little differently .\n\u201c Often men have a harder time accessing their feelings and acknowledging that they have eating issues , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along so maybe their brains find that more accessible.\n\u201d For men , longstanding diet tips might actually feel new \u2014 especially because Noom presents them as digestible factoids .\nFor example , for every calorie you burn , you get half a calorie back for your food intake .\nNoom explains it thusly : \u201c When you create a calorie deficit , you \u2019 ll lose more weight .\nIt \u2019 s math .\nAnd science.\n\u201d \u201c It has that sciency veneer , the emphasis on psychology .\nThis is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , that speaks to men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s funny how common those diet rules are for women.\n\u201d For men , meanwhile , those rules are framed as brand new , and much more revelatory for their eating habits .\nNone of the men I spoke to said they were unhappy with the app .\n32-year-old Alex Thibodeau told me he has been using the app for around four months \u2014 he started after getting targeted ads on Instagram \u2014 and said he had lost around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me to sign up for it was the alleged promise of it being psychological , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They make using their app habitual .\nThe prompting they do keeps you addicted .\nIt makes me feel more accountable.\n\u201d Thibodeau said his progress on Noom has plateaued , but felt this was more to do with him than the app \u2019 s failings .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t feel as though it was a scam in the way that I feel a lot of apps tend to overpromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The shortcomings I \u2019 ve experienced with it are more to do with my lack of interest than the effectiveness of the app.\n\u201d ( Tribole said that was another unique characteristic of diets .\n\u201c [ Dieting ] is the only industry that blames the consumer , and the consumer believes it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s gaslighting 101.\n\u201d ) For 55-year-old Chris McNaught , it \u2019 s not the theory so much as the accountability element that has proved useful .\nMcNaught said he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\n( He regained 20 pounds after quitting the app , and has since rejoined . )\n\u201c I \u2019 m actually a licensed professional counselor , \u201d he said .\n\u201c [ Noom ] hasn \u2019 t taught me anything I didn \u2019 t already know , but they put it in concrete terms for me , why I think about food the way I do and the habits I repeat.\n\u201d McNaught said that Noom helped him break one of his unhealthy eating habits , namely going to Sonic after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t hungry .\n\u2018 That was one of my \u2018 fog \u2019 eating scripts , \u201d he said , using Noom \u2019 s term for consuming food when \u201c not fully present.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 m just trying to establish a new normal .\nI \u2019 m not going to be on Noom forever.\n\u201d At 5 feet , 10 inches , Thibodeau was told by the app to eat around 1,900 calories a day .\nMcNaught , at 6 feet , was told to eat just 1,500 calories .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around 5 feet , 7 inches or taller ) reported that they were told to consume between 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day .\nThis , simply put , is not enough .\n( When I asked Noom if they considered this amount of food sufficient for adult men , they said yes .\n\u201c There are a variety of inputs that get individuals to a recommended calorie goal \u2014 all based on safe and scientifically-proven research , \u201d a spokesperson said .\n\u201c Noom \u2019 s calorie budget is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and users have the option to manually adjust their goal.\n\u201d ) According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , intake for men should generally range between 2,400 to 3,000 calories a day .\n\u201c This is ridiculous , \u201d Resch said .\n\u201c They will feel starved on this calorie allotment.\n\u201d Resch mentioned the 1944 Minnesota Starvation Experiment , where men spent three months eating a diet of 3,200 calories a day , followed by six months of 1,570 calories a day ( split into breakfast and lunch ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamina , body temperature , heart rate , and sex drive .\nThe men became obsessed with food , fantasizing about it , becoming more depressed and irritable as time went on .\nMen may be an important market for Noom and its competitors because women are starting to diet less .\nOver the last three decades , fewer people have been dieting in general , but women are leading the charge against traditional diet programs .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this growing movement towards body positivity , weight inclusivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold for women and also trans folks and marginalized folks , a little more so than [ for ] cis straight white men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c The diet industry in general , and maybe Noom in particular , is looking to expand their market base.\n\u201d Last week , a friend who lives on the West Coast texted me from his parents \u2019 house .\nHe \u2019 d seen that ubiquitous Noom ad while watching sports on TV .\nHe was surprised \u2014 when was the last time he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe funny thing about that ad , which features the man finishing his meal , is that it focuses more on how he eats all his food than why he originally felt obligated to eat everything on it .\nThe way his dad glares at him while he does it is striking .\nHow did his father make him feel about not finishing his plate , or conversely , about eating \u201c too much \u201d ?\nWhat kind of psychological trauma might be tied up between him and his relationship with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play if someone is eating beyond satiety or undereating , if someone \u2019 s relationship with food is fraught and painful and demoralizing .\nWhich is what makes Noom so frustrating for some people .\nThe point of Noom , like most wellness-based diet programs , is still to get you to lose weight .\nAnd just because you \u2019 re using psychological tools in hopes of reshaping your brain into eating less food , less frequently , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that those are healthy habits .\nKnowing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain way doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re bound to change in a holistic , healthy way .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t have to track their calorie count , their exercise , label foods , weigh themselves every day , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u2018 There \u2019 s another way to live , beyond all this obsession.\n\u201d \u25cf If you \u2019 re dealing with an eating disorder and need someone to talk to , the National Eating Disorders Association helpline is 1-800-931-2237 ; for 24/7 crisis support , text \u201c @ @ @ @ @",

.\nThis is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out .\nTo that end , the White House last July released interim guidance on how federal agencies should think about the 40 % goal and identify programs that would be impacted .\nMost , if not all , federal agencies delivered an update on this in December , according to Mallory .\n\u201c And so all of that sets us up for 2022 , \u201d Mallory said .\nPerhaps the first step will be the release of the administration \u2019 s environmental justice scorecard , a tool for helping track the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration initially said the scorecard would be released this February .\nBut that may not happen , Mallory acknowledged .\n\u201c I think our main aim for that is definitely the first quarter , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I won \u2019 t swear to February.\n\u201d Mallory also declined to put a date on the release of final Justice40 guidance or the launch of a climate and environmental justice screening tool , which will include interactive maps to help officials define and identify disadvantaged communities .\nBut she seemed optimistic both would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she couldn \u2019 t say how soon .\nAlthough Mallory did not go into detail on why some staff recently left her office , she said new hiring would happen .\nThe office \u201c will certainly have at least one person coming in , \u201d she said , \u201c but I wouldn \u2019 t be surprised if there were more.\n\u201d That \u2019 s on top of the hiring of at least one new official working explicitly on environmental justice in December , bringing the current numbers of staffers dedicated to this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Council on Environmental Quality .\nAli was cautiously optimistic to hear this , as someone who has been calling on the White House to keep expanding its staff working specifically on environmental justice .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a need to make sure that those positions are filled as quickly as possible with qualified individuals , and to expand out additional folks who are needed , \u201d he said .\nMallory , though , did not bat away complaints from activists who are frustrated by her office \u2019 s speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also would like to be going faster , \u201d she said .",

        "content": "My grandfather almost made it to 2022 .\nHis final years were largely spent in isolation with his wife as the pandemic dragged on .\nGrandpa had stopped taking his daily walks after hearing reports of violent attacks against Asian American people , who were being blamed for the health crisis .\nBetter to be safe , we all thought .\nBut month by month , this forced sedentary lifestyle took its toll on his older body .\nHe didn \u2019 t have COVID , but he grew weak .\nHis ability to walk diminished through the pandemic .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather left us .\nIt was Christmas Day , which on the lunar calendar was also his birthday .\nBy traditional Chinese convention , Grandpa saw the dawn of his 96th year .\nWhen he could no longer breathe on his own , the relatives who were able to rush to the hospital in Queens were allowed to visit his bedside one at a time , per the hospital \u2019 s pandemic rules , to whisper our goodbyes to him through our masks .\nHow do you say farewell when you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his resemblance in my baby son , whom he had only met once because COVID never went away .\n\u201c Goodbye , gong gong , \u201d I said .\n\u201c Thank you.\n\u201d My grandfather was buried beside my grandmother \u2019 s grave in a Brooklyn cemetery on a foggy day , surrounded by his family \u2014 just not me .\nFor two years I had managed to dodge COVID , but it had finally caught up with me on this of all days .\nIt happened at 6 a.m. the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suddenly had a fever .\nJust a day earlier , I got a negative PCR result , clearing myself to attend the service , so I stared in disbelief as two pink lines materialized on the rapid test I was taking at my bathroom sink before the sun had even risen : positive .\nAs I breathed through alternating waves of grief and numbness over the last two years , I \u2019 ve regularly told myself , Just keep doing your part to end the pandemic .\nBut with thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look ahead to year three , I now feel there is little more I have left to offer this cause .\nThis changing virus is hard to predict , but I can \u2019 t shake the sense that we blew our shot to make things better .\nIt was only a month ago that the White House brushed off the idea of shipping a test to every American , sending local officials around the country scrambling to open more testing sites as Omicron began its unhindered spread through schools , nursing homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 million cases , roughly a third of all confirmed cases in the US since the start of the pandemic in 2020 , have been counted since Dec. 1 , according to data compiled by the New York Times .\nThe White House finally announced in mid-January that it would buy a billion at-home rapid COVID tests , so that each \u201c residential address \u201d is entitled to one set of four tests , to be sent out at the end of the month .\nPeople can order them online ( the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chinese ) and a phone line will be open for those who don \u2019 t have internet access .\nIt \u2019 s strange how such a massive undertaking can still feel like too little , too late .\nVaccines have changed the game , protecting people from the worst outcomes , but the emotional toll of the pandemic is wearing .\nOmicron \u2019 s pervasive spread the last few weeks means new variants are almost certainly evolving , with no guarantee that they will be milder or less contagious , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , there are no good options .\nI , like so many , have lost the will to go back into the bunker because two years in , I now know that the people who have never cared about the pandemic and who refuse to take precautions will continue to spread the virus .\nAnd I now know our government will protect these freedoms over everyone \u2019 s safety ( the Supreme Court recently blocked a Biden administration rule requiring large companies to mandate that their staff be vaccinated ) .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though .\nEven vaccinated people can spread the coronavirus now .\nThe silver lining I once thought was near has faded .\n\u201c It 's just been two long years of uncertainty , and unpredictability , and having to constantly course-correct based on new information that is often incomplete , that does n't have a clear black-and-white answer to it , \u201d said psychologist Vaile Wright , the American Psychological Association \u2019 s senior director of healthcare innovation .\n\u201c We 've just reached the point where it 's starting to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it is.\n\u201d What more can I do ?\nI \u2019 ve played all my cards .\nI \u2019 ve stayed home for most of the last 22 months .\nI have abstained from simple things that once gave me so much pleasure : cozy Manhattan restaurants , outsize gatherings of friends and family , movie theaters throbbing with energy on opening weekends .\nI \u2019 ve dutifully worn my mask as required .\nI \u2019 ve navigated changing rules at daycares and schools , and the disruptions of keeping my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illness or a case is reported in the classroom .\nI got vaccinated as soon as I could .\nI \u2019 ve been trying to protect not only myself but also my kids , who are still too young to protect themselves .\nNone of this is unique ; millions of Americans share this reality .\nBut the incredible scale of this wave made me lose any sense of control .\nStuck at home the day of my grandfather \u2019 s funeral , I threw my rapid test in the trash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our discipline , and our caution , and our sacrifices through the pandemic now seemed futile ; the inevitability of having to breathe the same air as the people around us meant we couldn \u2019 t prevent the virus \u2019 s spread .\nI knew I was still luckier than many people who had the virus , or who had lost loved ones to it , but these cold assurances brought me little comfort that day .\nI replayed the last few days in my mind , ruminating on how I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been even more diligent so I could have stayed well and been at the funeral with them .\nBut I was defeated .\nThe pandemic had taken so much from us .\nCOVID hospitalizations and deaths have continued to rise since my grandfather died , but I have nothing left to give to help end this pandemic .\nPerhaps we just move forward with the uncomfortable reality that \u201c just about everybody \u201d will catch the virus , according to the White House \u2019 s chief medical adviser , Anthony Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unvaccinated in particular , will not survive .\nThe truth is , \u201c a lot of things are out of our control , \u201d Wright said .\nAt this point , people could benefit from a shift in mindset that includes a level of acceptance \u2014 not necessarily approval \u2014 that this is just how life is going to be .\nThere is no right way to deal with the pandemic now , she said .\nLike most other vaccinated people who tested positive , I found my symptoms were mild .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a local pharmacy , came with no instructions about what to do if you test positive , or who to inform .\nI had previously called my state health department to self-report a case but didn \u2019 t get through .\nOfficial counts don \u2019 t include cases like mine ; we are the invisible wave .\nOne billion tests are soon going to be conducted from home , their results unreported and unknown .\nIt seems as if our leaders , caught completely unprepared by this wave , are increasingly leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get to the other side .\nFor the vaccinated , the stakes are different now .\nSerious disease is unlikely , and it seems we \u2019 re moving away from a state of emergency .\nSchools are open , business goes on , and quarantine periods are now down from 10 days to five .\nBut the virus is still here , and we each have to reckon with it and make wrenching decisions on our own , every day .\nWe move forward by putting one foot in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know where we \u2019 re headed .\nI thought \u201c getting better \u201d would feel better than this .\nWhen my isolation period ended , I left my room and gave my children the tightest hugs .\nI pressed them into me , pushed their fleshy cheeks against mine .\nI had missed them more than I could imagine .\nIt had only been days , but they somehow seemed bigger .\nI wished I had answers ; all parents do .\nI held them and thought , For however long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight \u2014 we are in it together .\n\u25cf",

        "title": "Noom Isn\u2019t Reinventing The Diet Wheel",
        "content": "The app claims to rely on science and psychology to help you lose weight .\nBut it may not be that different from any other deprivation diet .\nI keep getting this ad for the Noom app , served up with so many YouTube videos and cable TV shows that I feel uniquely targeted by them .\nIt begins with a supercut of an attractive young man clearing plate after plate at restaurants , waving off waiters while a folksy cover of \u201c Where Is My Mind \u201d by the Pixies plays .\nThen he stares agape at his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks and drinking beer .\n\u201c I was conditioned to finish my plate since childhood ?\n\u201d he says , astonished ; we see a flashback of a kid mopping up the last of an egg while his father glares at him .\n\u201c When it comes to losing weight , it \u2019 s psychological , \u201d the voiceover says .\nThe message : Noom is different .\nIt will help you get thinner the smart way .\nMuch of Noom \u2019 s advertising leans on this \u201c not like the other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet .\nStart going on Noom , \u201d one ad says .\n\u201c The last weight loss program you \u2019 ll ever need , \u201d another says .\nThe people who work there use the same framing .\n\u201c We think of it as a health and wellness tool , \u201d Noom President Artem Petkov told me over Zoom last year .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a psychology-minded type of education .\nIt \u2019 s how you teach people the behavioral science of these things , to empower them .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I google \u201c diet , \u201d the first result is a Noom ad ( your algorithm may vary ) .\nNoom \u2019 s core offering is called Noom Weight , which \u201c empowers participants to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through lifestyle intervention.\n\u201d One prong is a general \u201c health \u201d program , and there \u2019 s another for those looking to manage their diabetes , but it \u2019 s clear that at least one major purpose of Noom is to help you lose weight \u2014 key elements include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text that emphasizes losing weight .\nNoom says it wants to help you lose weight \u201c sustainably , \u201d meaning gradually , long-term , and through behavioral changes as opposed to rigid rules and elimination diets .\nIn one Noom ad , a woman talks about how she lost 87 pounds , saying that in order to lose the weight , she had to \u2014 and here , she taps on her head \u2014 lose the weight .\n\u201c We consider ourselves to be a digital health platform , \u201d a Noom spokesperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Calling Noom a diet is like calling a car an engine or a ship a sail \u2014 it \u2019 s a part of the vehicle but not the whole picture.\n\u201d ( Noom also has a newer offering called Noom Mood , designed to \u201c help you develop the techniques , emotional awareness and resilience to reduce stress and live a happier life.\n\u201d ) Noom does differ from its competitors in two ways .\nFirst , its novel app-based approach explains the \u201c psychology \u201d of what you \u2019 re choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating , and when you \u2019 re eating .\n\u201c We use gold-standard principles from psychology ( CBT , ACT , DBT , etc . )\nto help users understand why they should and how they can create healthier behaviors \u2014 not just what to eat , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me via email .\nThe goal is to teach your brain to overcome bad habits and unnecessary calories .\nCravings are contextualized as emotional eating , and emotional eating as conquerable .\nSecond , it \u2019 s much more expensive than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership is around $ 60 , while comparable Weight Watchers services , for example , run to about half that price .\nBut none of this really differentiates Noom from the diet programs and apps it seeks to define itself against .\nUltimately , its aims are the same : to help you eat less , so you can weigh less .\nWe might as well get this out of the way : Diets don \u2019 t work .\nIt \u2019 s been proven many , many , many times .\nEven if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short term , you \u2019 re more likely to gain that weight back than to actually keep it off .\nDeprivation diets in particular impact your metabolism , making it even harder to keep that weight off in the future .\n( That \u2019 s why a lot of The Biggest Loser contestants struggle to keep their weight down after they leave the show , which reportedly restricts what they eat to under 1,000 calories a day . )\nBecause of an antiquated idea from the early 1900s , most deprivation diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1,500 daily calorie allotment , which is essentially equivalent to the appropriate amount of food for a particularly large dog .\nDiets that require you to cut out entire food groups \u2014 like the keto diet or the Whole30 program \u2014 could fail in similar ways .\nEven if you do lose weight , you \u2019 re unlikely to keep it off , and at worst , your metabolism slows down long term .\nNoom has one other similarity with its competitors : Its approach suggests that losing weight is simply a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily true .\nPsychology is just one influence , because biochemistry , genetics , and environment play a role too .\nThe way Noom sees it , cravings and caloric needs beyond its guidelines are compulsions that your mind can crush .\nBut do understanding and modifying your thoughts really help if you live in a food desert ?\nCan you mind over matter yourself out of starvation mode while eating far less than what your body actually requires to function optimally ?\nPerhaps the most significant difference is really Noom \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached beyond the traditional weight-loss audience of women to also target men .\nNoom ads feature a lot of men , and the app seems to have a higher percentage of male users than others in its category .\n( When asked , Noom would not confirm their user demographics . )\nUnlike wellness and diet programs marketed to women ( like Gwyneth Paltrow \u2019 s juice cleanse routine ) , which are usually promoted using the flowery language of self-care and beach-body imagery , Noom presents itself as rooted in science .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard facts .\nIt \u2019 s a diet app that \u2019 s dressed up in a therapist \u2019 s blazer and slacks , giving you advice on how to change for the \u201c better , \u201d telling you that if only you could just get out of your own way , you could do the impossible and make this diet work for the rest of your life .\nIt \u2019 s not like Noom invented the idea of men dieting .\nKeto-based plans are often marketed to men and 10 % of Weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 11th century , William the Conqueror lost weight by going on a liquid diet of nothing but alcohol and became thin enough to resume riding his beloved horse .\n( In 1087 , though , he died in a riding accident . )\nIn the \u2019 50s , people started drinking apple cider vinegar to stay thin , something that Lord Byron did in the 19th century .\nAnd in the \u2019 60s , \u201c The Drinking Man \u2019 s Diet \u201d was introduced , advising men to drink as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while eating fish and steak .\nIn 2019 , the diet market reached a record $ 78 billion in the US alone ( there was a small decline in 2020 because of the pandemic ) .\nAnd the male weight-loss market is steadily growing ; for the last decade , Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig have seemingly also been refocusing some of their energy to capture the male market .\nIn 2018 , Atkins brought in Rob Lowe \u2014 their first male spokesperson \u2014 to promote their products to other men .\nWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Noom is right at the top , promising to change your life in just 16 weeks .\nNoom was founded in 2008 , the brainchild of 42-year-old Saeju Jeong , who came up with the idea after his father died of lung cancer 20 years ago .\nRaised in South Korea , Jeong started his first business \u2014 a record label \u2014 at 19 before moving to the US in 2005 and launching the app in 2016 .\n\u201c We want to help many lives , as many as we can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in an interview last year .\n\u201c Weight management is the most effective and efficient way to deliver health .\nIt \u2019 s simple .\nIt \u2019 s powerful.\n\u201d Fourteen years later , Noom is generating $ 400 million in revenue and is gearing up for a $ 10 billion valuation once it launches an IPO , which could happen this year or in early 2023 .\nThe diet industry has changed significantly in the last few years , turning away from promoting weight loss and toward \u201c wellness.\n\u201d If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restrictive program used to lose weight , then the language of wellness is often employed for a softer , gentler approach .\nWeight Watchers is now called WW , sometimes referred to as WellnessWins .\nThe low-carb Atkins diet is now about \u201c a life well lived , \u201d and Jenny Craig \u2019 s site has a Healthy Habits section with suggestions that go beyond weight loss .\nBy also co-opting the language of wellness , Noom has effectively captured people \u2019 s attention \u2014 the app reportedly has 50 million users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum have lent high-profile shine as well : \u201c Noom \u2019 s mix of empathetic human support paired with modern technology and science makes it possible for people to achieve significant , lasting behavior change , \u201d Williams said in a 2019 Noom press release .\nBut what anti-diet nutritionists and therapists see are the same old diet culture rules , just wrapped up in a different skin .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a good example of diet culture shape-shifting , \u201d said Evelyn Tribole , a registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intuitive Eating .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve seen Weight Watchers rebrand because they \u2019 re trying to move away from dieting .\nYou can call it whatever you want .\nYou can say you \u2019 re using mindful tools .\nIn the end , when you \u2019 re counting calories and categorizing food and tracking your weight , it \u2019 s a diet.\n\u201d When you give Noom any of your information , it talks back to you like a comforting coach , someone who \u2019 s on your team no matter your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate just like a diet , albeit one made to look like a gamified MyFitnessPal .\nThe interface for Noom looks a little like a board game , your marker steadily moving along the path every day you use it .\nThe app quizzes you and rewards you with encouragement when you get the right answers .\nIt gives you the endorphin rush of checking off a box on a to-do list .\nEven before you sign into the app , the Noom website asks a series of questions to hook you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person \u2019 s potential weight loss .\n( Noom claims it can help you lose one to two pounds a week . )\nWhen you respond to a questionnaire that asks about health risks like diabetes or high blood pressure , it coos back , \u201c We \u2019 re really glad you shared .\nWeight loss is an important goal , but Noom \u2019 s mission is helping people get healthier , whatever that is for them.\n\u201d The questionnaire also asks whether you have an \u201c active diagnosis \u201d of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it suggests you talk to a therapist instead of continuing to sign up for Noom . )\nLike many other web-based diet programs or trackers , the Noom app requires you to input all your calories and movements .\nIt categorizes your food : green ( largely fresh fruit and vegetables ) , yellow ( lean meats and dairy ) , and red ( desserts , saturated fats ) .\nYour green allotment is limitless , while just a couple hundred calories of red is permitted a day .\nWhen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chirps back , \u201c Great choice \u2014 Enjoy !\n\u201d but red foods come with a warning : \u201c Limit your portions.\n\u201d ( Calorie counts for each category are listed in small print . )\nYou \u2019 re prompted to weigh yourself daily so the app can track your \u201c progress.\n\u201d If you forget to log into the app for more than a day or two , you \u2019 re sent a text to remind you to get back in there .\nThe app assigns you daily tasks , like reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more \u201c mindful \u201d when you \u2019 re stress-eating .\nYou also get a series of motivational sticky notes that say things like , \u201c Stop saying I wish .\nStart saying I will , \u201d and \u201c Great things never come from comfort zones.\n\u201d Another day , it \u2019 ll present you with a PowerPoint-like presentation featuring the definition for metacognition , \u201c a fancy psych term that describes an awareness and understanding of one \u2019 s thoughts and thought processes.\n\u201d You are told to \u201c embrace \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noom offers an option of working one-on-one with a coach \u2014 the company employs 3,000 coaches across the country , all trained as dieticians , psychologists , or therapists \u2014 as well as a support group , where users can keep each other on track .\n\u201c We have a lot of customers who might not get the weight loss that they want to get , but what we hear all the time is , \u2018 I feel different as a person , \u2019 \u201d Andreas Michaelides , chief of psychology at Noom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 I have a different relationship with food .\nI have a different relationship with my body.\n\u2019 \u201d But the psychological element is exactly what may make Noom potentially harmful .\nWhen you fail at Noom , you don \u2019 t just fail the way you might fail a typical diet \u2014 physically , because your body needs more food or is craving calories or comfort \u2014 but you also fail psychologically .\nBoth Tribole and her Intuitive Eating coauthor , nutrition therapist Elyse Resch , have had clients who have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complicated relationship with food .\n\u201c It becomes a mindfuck for our patients , because they think , Oh my god , I tried the psychology and it doesn \u2019 t work , \u201d Tribole said .\nAnd as with other diets , it seems inevitable that many users will fail Noom \u2019 s program .\n\u201c They \u2019 re telling you it could be mind over matter , but it \u2019 s not possible .\nThe survival part of the brain is going to do whatever it can to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can learn how to have power over [ other habits ] but not something that \u2019 s so physiological and neurochemical .\nYou can not overcome that unless you \u2019 re priming yourself for a very serious eating disorder.\n\u201d \u201c This has an impact , causing food obsessionality , food worry , food anxiety , feeling like you \u2019 re lost , out of control eating , \u201d Tribole said .\nShe likened a diet to being pulled underwater by an ocean \u2019 s riptides .\n\u201c When a big set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you hold your breath .\nWhen you come back up , you can take a big breath : ahhhh .\nNo one denigrates you , Oh my god , you \u2019 re addicted to air .\nThis is what happens when you restrict your eating below what your body needs it to be .\nYou \u2019 re going to be gasping for food.\n\u201d I tried Noom twice , and both times I failed .\nI lost a little weight , but not much \u2014 the app told me to consume just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nearly enough for my 5-foot-5-inch frame .\nI binged every night ; I felt like a failure .\nBut Noom considers failing a part of the process .\n\u201c The psychological tools we teach are geared towards a holistic understanding of how people can use their self-awareness to change any type of behavior , \u201d a Noom spokesperson told me .\n\u201c We hear many instances of people who might not lose the amount of weight they wanted when they came into the program but leave with a great deal of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-compassion.\n\u201d Using these apps is different for everyone , and some people I spoke to did have success losing weight .\nBut others said they had trouble like I did , which impacted their sense of self-worth .\n\u201c When I joined Noom , I was probably at my leanest and strongest .\nPhysically , I was my most capable , \u201d said Kate ( who asked to be identified by a pseudonym ) , a 27-year-old woman who tried Noom in 2019 .\n\u201c Once I got on Noom and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deteriorated .\nIt overpowered how strong I felt in my body .\nThose weigh-ins definitely messed with my head.\n\u201d The dozens of women I spoke to about Noom had some version of this story : They joined the app to lose that last 10 pounds , or to work on their relationship with food , and were instead rattled by the weigh-ins and the tight calorie count ( \u201c Almonds are a red food , \u201d Kate said , incredulous ) .\nThey also didn \u2019 t find the psychological element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were raised in some form of diet culture , meaning that they already knew some of Noom \u2019 s tips \u2014 like taking a sip of water between bites to slow you down \u2014 and decided the app might not be worth $ 60 a month .\n\u201c [ It \u2019 s ] mental gymnastics and rhetorical pretzel-twisting to say this isn \u2019 t about weight , it \u2019 s about psychology , \u201d Christy Harrison , registered dietician and author of Anti-Diet , said .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen Noom try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the numbers and you \u2019 re not a failure if your weight doesn \u2019 t change , but how does that square with making people weigh themselves every day , and using a traffic light system to categorize foods ?\nOf course that creates a sense of good and bad foods.\n\u201d Even the app \u2019 s framing of how you eat can feel weaponized .\nTake , for example , the way Noom talks about cravings , describing them as an \u201c inner elephant , \u201d an \u201c impulsive , irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tame your elephant , to make it behave .\nBut that really means you should behave .\n\u201c The emotional eating piece really gets to me , the way it demonizes emotional eating , meanwhile creating the conditions for it to happen , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c Of course you \u2019 re going to feel so deprived after a few days or weeks of a 1,200 calorie diet .\nI would be crawling out of my skin.\n\u201d Also : an elephant ?\nReally ?\nCome on .\nNoom \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in the context of the male-dominated trends of bio-hacking and self-optimization .\nLast year , former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed to follow one of the most horrific diets I \u2019 ve ever heard of : one meal per weekday , and a full weekend of fasting .\n( This is a version of intermittent fasting \u2014 which is usually a 16-hour fast , or one 24-hour fast a week , and not two full days of starvation , which is an unhealthy routine . )\nThere are fasting clubs in Silicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and step with interactive watches and rings , and a lot of those devices are targeted specifically to men looking to optimize their bodies and brains .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not quite as extreme as Jack Dorsey \u2019 s intermittent fasting thing , but it \u2019 s still this instrumentalization of your relationship with food , putting it into the realm of intellect and numbers and apps , \u201d Harrison said of Noom \u2019 s method .\n\u201c I have seen men for whom Noom was the trigger \u2014 it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of severely disordered eating.\n\u201d Men make up around 1 in 3 or 1 in 4 cases of eating disorders , but many of them rarely get treatment .\nThe app might also speak to men because they are traditionally not very practiced in talking about their feelings , especially around food , and Noom seemingly provides a space to do so , or at least think about food a little differently .\n\u201c Often men have a harder time accessing their feelings and acknowledging that they have eating issues , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along so maybe their brains find that more accessible.\n\u201d For men , longstanding diet tips might actually feel new \u2014 especially because Noom presents them as digestible factoids .\nFor example , for every calorie you burn , you get half a calorie back for your food intake .\nNoom explains it thusly : \u201c When you create a calorie deficit , you \u2019 ll lose more weight .\nIt \u2019 s math .\nAnd science.\n\u201d \u201c It has that sciency veneer , the emphasis on psychology .\nThis is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , that speaks to men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s funny how common those diet rules are for women.\n\u201d For men , meanwhile , those rules are framed as brand new , and much more revelatory for their eating habits .\nNone of the men I spoke to said they were unhappy with the app .\n32-year-old Alex Thibodeau told me he has been using the app for around four months \u2014 he started after getting targeted ads on Instagram \u2014 and said he had lost around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me to sign up for it was the alleged promise of it being psychological , \u201d he said .\n\u201c They make using their app habitual .\nThe prompting they do keeps you addicted .\nIt makes me feel more accountable.\n\u201d Thibodeau said his progress on Noom has plateaued , but felt this was more to do with him than the app \u2019 s failings .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t feel as though it was a scam in the way that I feel a lot of apps tend to overpromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The shortcomings I \u2019 ve experienced with it are more to do with my lack of interest than the effectiveness of the app.\n\u201d ( Tribole said that was another unique characteristic of diets .\n\u201c [ Dieting ] is the only industry that blames the consumer , and the consumer believes it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s gaslighting 101.\n\u201d ) For 55-year-old Chris McNaught , it \u2019 s not the theory so much as the accountability element that has proved useful .\nMcNaught said he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .\n( He regained 20 pounds after quitting the app , and has since rejoined . )\n\u201c I \u2019 m actually a licensed professional counselor , \u201d he said .\n\u201c [ Noom ] hasn \u2019 t taught me anything I didn \u2019 t already know , but they put it in concrete terms for me , why I think about food the way I do and the habits I repeat.\n\u201d McNaught said that Noom helped him break one of his unhealthy eating habits , namely going to Sonic after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t hungry .\n\u2018 That was one of my \u2018 fog \u2019 eating scripts , \u201d he said , using Noom \u2019 s term for consuming food when \u201c not fully present.\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 m just trying to establish a new normal .\nI \u2019 m not going to be on Noom forever.\n\u201d At 5 feet , 10 inches , Thibodeau was told by the app to eat around 1,900 calories a day .\nMcNaught , at 6 feet , was told to eat just 1,500 calories .\nSome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around 5 feet , 7 inches or taller ) reported that they were told to consume between 1,500 to 2,000 calories a day .\nThis , simply put , is not enough .\n( When I asked Noom if they considered this amount of food sufficient for adult men , they said yes .\n\u201c There are a variety of inputs that get individuals to a recommended calorie goal \u2014 all based on safe and scientifically-proven research , \u201d a spokesperson said .\n\u201c Noom \u2019 s calorie budget is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and users have the option to manually adjust their goal.\n\u201d ) According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , intake for men should generally range between 2,400 to 3,000 calories a day .\n\u201c This is ridiculous , \u201d Resch said .\n\u201c They will feel starved on this calorie allotment.\n\u201d Resch mentioned the 1944 Minnesota Starvation Experiment , where men spent three months eating a diet of 3,200 calories a day , followed by six months of 1,570 calories a day ( split into breakfast and lunch ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamina , body temperature , heart rate , and sex drive .\nThe men became obsessed with food , fantasizing about it , becoming more depressed and irritable as time went on .\nMen may be an important market for Noom and its competitors because women are starting to diet less .\nOver the last three decades , fewer people have been dieting in general , but women are leading the charge against traditional diet programs .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this growing movement towards body positivity , weight inclusivity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold for women and also trans folks and marginalized folks , a little more so than [ for ] cis straight white men , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u201c The diet industry in general , and maybe Noom in particular , is looking to expand their market base.\n\u201d Last week , a friend who lives on the West Coast texted me from his parents \u2019 house .\nHe \u2019 d seen that ubiquitous Noom ad while watching sports on TV .\nHe was surprised \u2014 when was the last time he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe funny thing about that ad , which features the man finishing his meal , is that it focuses more on how he eats all his food than why he originally felt obligated to eat everything on it .\nThe way his dad glares at him while he does it is striking .\nHow did his father make him feel about not finishing his plate , or conversely , about eating \u201c too much \u201d ?\nWhat kind of psychological trauma might be tied up between him and his relationship with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play if someone is eating beyond satiety or undereating , if someone \u2019 s relationship with food is fraught and painful and demoralizing .\nWhich is what makes Noom so frustrating for some people .\nThe point of Noom , like most wellness-based diet programs , is still to get you to lose weight .\nAnd just because you \u2019 re using psychological tools in hopes of reshaping your brain into eating less food , less frequently , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that those are healthy habits .\nKnowing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain way doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re bound to change in a holistic , healthy way .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t have to track their calorie count , their exercise , label foods , weigh themselves every day , \u201d Harrison said .\n\u2018 There \u2019 s another way to live , beyond all this obsession.\n\u201d \u25cf If you \u2019 re dealing with an eating disorder and need someone to talk to , the National Eating Disorders Association helpline is 1-800-931-2237 ; for 24/7 crisis support , text \u201c @ @ @ @ @",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department dropped a bombshell a week and a half ago with the first seditious conspiracy indictment in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection .\nOn Tuesday , a judge spent more than two hours trying to untangle the logistics of what happens next .\nNineteen people with alleged ties to the Oath Keepers extremist group are charged across three separate cases with playing some role in the attack on the Capitol .\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta announced on Tuesday that one set of defendants \u2014 those charged with conspiring to obstruct Congress , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 19 over objections from their lawyers that it \u2019 s too soon .\nAs for the 11 seditious conspiracy defendants \u2014 a group that includes Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes \u2014 Mehta set a trial date for July 11 .\nHe scheduled a second trial for Sept. 26 if it proved too unwieldy to keep that group together .\nIn another notable moment during the marathon hearing , Assistant US Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said that in advance of trial the government was open to plea negotiations and had already broached the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new indictment might change some defendants \u2019 \u201c perspective \u201d on what they wanted to do , she told the judge .\nThe seditious conspiracy indictment marked a major milestone in the Jan. 6 investigation , but Mehta signaled he was wary of that development stretching out the timeline of the trials .\nThe original Oath Keepers case was filed just a few weeks after the insurrection .\nIn the months that followed , prosecutors added new defendants and filled in more details about their alleged role in the conspiracy and events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurrection .\nMehta said he didn \u2019 t think the latest indictment changed much in terms of the scope of what the government had already put forward in that earlier case .\nThree defendants charged in the original Oath Keepers case who were included in the seditious conspiracy indictment \u2014 Jessica Watkins , Kelly Meggs , and Kenneth Harrelson \u2014 have been in jail since they were arrested in the early months of 2021 , which adds to the pressure to get them to trial .\nDefense lawyers offered a preview of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosecutors are waiting for a federal magistrate judge in Texas to rule on whether he \u2019 ll have to stay in jail pending trial .\nRhodes \u2019 lawyer Phillip Linder told Mehta that whichever side lost in the Texas court planned to appeal to Mehta ; the judge told the attorneys to contact his chambers as soon as there was a ruling so he could quickly set a schedule .\nA lawyer for Thomas Caldwell , another defendant named in the seditious conspiracy case , asked Mehta to set a schedule for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured in the latest indictment .\nSedition is a rarely brought offense ; federal prosecutors last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment , and a judge acquitted defendants of that count two years later .\nMehta has rejected legal challenges so far to charges in the earlier Oath Keepers conspiracy indictment , and he said on Tuesday that those rulings would carry over to the new case .\nAll 19 defendants charged in the three Oath Keepers cases are accused of trying to obstruct Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allege conspiracies .\nThe seditious conspiracy indictment accuses Rhodes and his 10 codefendants of being part of a plot to use force to stop the transfer of power from former president Donald Trump to President Joe Biden .\nSeditious conspiracy sweeps more broadly than the original conspiracy count ; the former delves into the alleged anti-government motivations of defendants , while the latter focuses more on the practicalities of alleged planning by the Oath Keepers to attack the Capitol on Jan. 6 .\nNine of the 17 people named in the original Oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seditious conspiracy case along with Rhodes and Edward Vallejo .\nSeven of the original defendants were charged in an updated indictment .\nThe last defendant , Jonathan Walden , was reindicted separate from the rest of the group .\nHe \u2019 s no longer charged with conspiracy , and the government hasn \u2019 t publicly explained why .\nMehta didn \u2019 t set a trial date for Walden , and he instead scheduled a hearing next month for an update .\nTuesday \u2019 s hearing began with arraignments on the three latest indictments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial pleas of \u201c not guilty \u201d to the charges .\nVallejo was not present .\nA federal magistrate judge in Arizona ruled last week that he must stay in jail while the case is pending ; he hasn \u2019 t pursued an appeal with Mehta yet .\nA lawyer for James Beeks , one of the defendants left in the original conspiracy case , told the judge on Tuesday that they would \u201c stand silent \u201d instead of entering a plea ; Beeks \u2019 s lawyer , Wisconsin federal public defender Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that during the hearing and did not immediately return a request for comment .\nBeeks was only added to the Oath Keepers case in November , and Mehta said he wouldn \u2019 t need to worry about the April trial date .\nThe April and July trial dates had been on the calendar before , but the latest round of indictments prompted Mehta to change the order .\nThe judge had planned for the jailed defendants \u2014 Watkins , Meggs , and Harrelson \u2014 to go first but decided that was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges and new codefendants in the seditious conspiracy case .\nDefense lawyers with clients in the original conspiracy case argued to Mehta that the April date wasn \u2019 t doable for them either .\nThey told the judge that the government was still turning over evidence and that they needed time to understand how the seditious conspiracy case affected their clients since they involved overlapping characters and events .\nMehta said he was \u201c sympathetic \u201d to their concerns but stuck with the April date ; they already had the \u201c core \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge explained .\nRakoczy told the judge that her office expected to turn over more materials to defendants and their lawyers in the next four to six weeks , including witness interview reports and information that investigators pulled from electronic devices and online accounts that belonged to some defendants as well as \u201c subjects \u201d of the investigation who hadn \u2019 t been charged and witnesses .",

sex education in America and the lack of realism in porn or really any media depictions of sex , sexual pleasure can be hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you \u2019 re interested in taking the steps to learn what you might actually like , it may be time to bring on the sex toys .\n\u201c We still live in a culture that tends to normalize certain kinds of sex and make that expected for everyone , \u201d said Carol Queen , staff sexologist at Good Vibrations , a sex-positive adult toy shop founded in 1977 .\n\u201c Many people don \u2019 t understand even now that the clitoris , for people who have one , is the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany people think it \u2019 s the vagina , and while plenty of people love vaginal penetration , it \u2019 s not the primary way most people with vaginas orgasm.\n\u201d In fact , a 2017 study of more than 1,000 people ages 18 to 94 published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 % percent of people with vulvas could orgasm from internal stimulation alone .\nAside from targeting the clitoris , there are countless other ways to arouse people no matter what lies below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in nerve endings , so we can experience pleasure in our whole body , not just genitals , \u201d Brooklyn-based sex therapist Carolanne Marcantonio explained .\n\u201c Oftentimes we go right for the genitals , but there \u2019 s a whole world of pleasure to experience from head to toe.\n\u201d The amount of nerve endings on your body vary , which is why some areas may feel more sensitive than others , but Marcantonio maintains that the brain is the largest erogenous zone .\nHow to find , choose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic interests and curiosity are the biggest guideposts to what they might like , \u201d said Queen , who has a PhD in sexology from The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality , in discussing how to find props that work for you .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re turned on to the idea of playing with just about anything , it \u2019 s a sex toy.\n\u201d That said , she emphasizes that it \u2019 s not safe to insert or use just any item you find around the house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting sex toy shops that were founded to make better quality sexual products available , especially to women .\nMarcantonio started her career on the sales floor at sex toy shop Babeland , which requires a monthlong training in the anatomy of pleasure and how to use appropriate language to respect customers \u2019 genders , expressions , and sexualities .\nVisiting a sex shop is a great way to find inspiration and consult with knowledgable staff before making a purchase .\nIf you don \u2019 t find exactly what you \u2019 re looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different brands and types of products , you can then take your search online .\nThese days , you can also find sex toys at mainstream stores .\nIn the two years since Erica Minor became the marketing and communications manager , intimate lifestyle company Lelo has partnered with brands like Anthropologie , Urban Outfitters , and Neiman Marcus .\n\u201c We really work hard , especially with our marketing campaigns , to break down the shame and stigma around sex and pleasure but also provide representation , \u201d Minor said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been socially acceptable for a certain minority of the population to talk about sex and express themselves sexually , so we really want to open that up to everybody regardless of their sexual expression , gender identity , race or sex.\n\u201d \u201c I love being able to introduce people to the many ways you can use these vibrators , \u201d said Julia Lopez , lead product engineer at Dame .\n\u201c People assume it \u2019 s just one way , but men love vibrators too.\n\u201d Queen agrees .\n\u201c Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 anybody might like vibration , \u201d she said .\nIn terms of use , most modern sex toys are fairly versatile in how they can come into play , whether used solo or partnered .\n\u201c We \u2019 re only limited by how limited our creativity is , \u201d Marcantonio said .\n\u201c The sky \u2019 s the limit , so really anything can be a couple \u2019 s toy .\nAnything.\n\u201d There are also toys that target multiple erogenous zones to help facilitate blended orgasms , which are not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Blended orgasms are when more than one erogenous area gets stimulated at the same time , and it can increase the odds of orgasm or strong orgasm , \u201d Queen said .\n\u201c That thinking allows for us to sort of normalize and explore toys during intercourse or other kinds of sex play to add to the experience.\n\u201d Not only can incorporating toys into partnered sex lead to more satisfying experiences , but stepping outside of your comfort zone in a safe space may also have the added benefit of strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exploring the building of trust and bonding and communication is also a heightened way to experience and build your coupledom , \u201d Marcantonio said .\nWhat materials are best for sex toys It \u2019 s essential for any sex toy to be made of something hypoallergenic and nonporous .\nSubstances that are able to break down or contain irritants should be avoided .\nThat list may include jelly rubber , which is made from polyvinyl chloride , or other compounds that could contain phthalates , which are potentially carcinogenic chemicals added to plastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c A lot of sex toys have been made with that [ phthalates ] and because sex toys aren \u2019 t regulated , there 's no one telling companies not to use it , \u201d Lopez said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of on the consumer to make sure they are looking up what material the product is made out of , and pretty much every website will tell you what material it is , and then making sure that material is a stable nontoxic one.\n\u201d Experts agree that silicone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silicone , though borosilicate glass ( which is shatterproof ) and medical-grade stainless steel are also good options if you \u2019 re interested in temperature play .\nHowever , keep in mind that some types of lubricants can break down sex toys made of silicone , so use a water-based product in those cases .\nAnother perk of silicone is that you can sometimes boil them once you remove the motor for maximum disinfection , though in most cases a sex toy cleaner or mild soap and warm water will be sufficient .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toy cleaner , Queen advises against using any with triclosan , which is an antibacterial compound that can be absorbed through your skin or mouth .\nToy cleaners are usable on those made from stainless steel or shatterproof glass as well , but the soap and water method should be sufficiently effective for any kind of waterproof sex toy .",

        "content": "Former president Donald Trump \u2019 s supporters who buy into his lies that the last election was stolen from him were elated Tuesday night with news from the right-wing Gateway Pundit : The Wisconsin legislature had just voted to withdraw the state \u2019 s electors for Joe Biden .\nThe only problem is : That didn \u2019 t actually happen .\nAnd , also , it \u2019 s not possible .\nThe original story , which has since been updated , claimed that the Wisconsin State Assembly voted \u201c unanimously \u201d Tuesday night to withdraw the state \u2019 s 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHere \u2019 s what actually happened : Republican Rep. Timothy Ramthun , a Trump supporter who has embraced election falsehoods , brought up his bill to withdraw the electors as a privileged resolution , meaning the Assembly had to respond to it .\nBut far from passing it , the Assembly \u2019 s presiding officer sent the bill to the Rules Committee .\nAnd the bill will die there , as the chair of that committee , Republican Rep. Jim Steineke , made clear Tuesday night .\n\u201c Not only is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstitutional , \u201d he tweeted .\n\u201c As chair of the Rules Committee , there is ZERO chance I will advance this illegal resolution .\n# EndofStory.\n\u201d Steineke , who serves as the Assembly majority leader , declined a request for an interview .\nNonetheless , the false story spread across the election conspiracy internet .\nKari Lake , the Trump-endorsed candidate for governor in Arizona , shared the news with her nearly 108,000 followers on Twitter , saying , \u201c Arizona should be next !\n\u201d Wisconsin state Rep. Mark Spreitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rules Committee and Campaigns and Elections Committee , told BuzzFeed News that after the Assembly sent Ramthun \u2019 s bill to the Rules Committee , the Republican tried another procedural move to force a vote on his bill .\nBut that , too , failed .\nThen members returned their attention to the bill they \u2019 d previously been working on ( a \u201c consensus bill \u201d related to online marketplaces , he said ) , which passed unanimously by voice vote .\n\u201c I think the Ramthun supporters who were watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution was already long gone and we were back onto the bill at hand .\nAnd they heard everybody say \u2018 Aye , \u2019 and they 're like , \u2018 Wow , we just passed the resolution , \u2019 \u201d Spreitzer said .\n\u201c But , no , we passed a totally unrelated bill that we started debating before Ramthun did all of this.\n\u201d Though the Gateway Pundit story has been updated to say that Ramthun \u2019 s bill merely advanced through the legislature and has not yet passed , it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice vote , despite video of the session included in the piece clearly showing that members were voting on another bill .\nBut still , the original headline and framing of the piece \u2014 \u201c Wisconsin Assembly Votes to Withdraw Its 10 Electors for Joe Biden in 2020 Election \u201d \u2014 have continued to spread .\nLake \u2019 s tweet is still up with more than 17,000 likes , though she \u2019 s since posted a follow-up , saying that Steineke \u201c is going to try to stop \u201d the bill from passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over Twitter , Facebook , and right-wing social media platforms like Telegram .\nThe updated story does not include a correction .\nInstead , it has a note at the end saying , \u201c This post has been updated as we gathered more information from our many sources.\n\u201d Jim Hoft , the founder of Gateway Pundit and author of the story , did not respond to a request for comment .\nThough Republican leaders in the Assembly were quick to criticize and dismiss Ramthun \u2019 s bill , they are currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own \u201c audit \u201d of the 2020 election and hired a retired justice who has said the election was stolen to run it .\nSpreitzer said Republican leaders \u2019 response to Ramthun \u2019 s bill was hypocritical .\n\u201c They do n't actually believe that the election was stolen , or that there was widespread fraud , and that 's of course why they are n't going to support Ramthun .\n...\nBut they 're absolutely fueling the very people who are behind Ramthun \u2019 s effort by their refusal to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a free and fair election .\nJoe Biden won .\nThere was no widespread fraud.\n\u2019 So they \u2019 re trying to have it both ways , \u201d he said .\nAlthough Trump and his most fringe supporters in the Republican Party have repeatedly said that the election should be \u201c decertified \u201d or that the electors should be \u201c recalled , \u201d there is no legal process for doing so .\nOn a more literal level , the electors are just voters who have presumably returned to their states , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut more broadly speaking , there is no constitutional method for undoing the 2020 election .\nWisconsin \u2019 s electors , along with those for all 50 states , cast their votes in the Electoral College and those votes were counted by Congress on Jan. 6 after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol .\nWisconsin state Sen. Kathy Bernier , a Republican who has made huge waves in her party for asserting that Biden won the election and that Republicans should stop enabling those who say he didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council to write a memo explaining that decertifying or recalling electors is not possible .\nAccording to the November memo , \u201c There is no mechanism in state or federal law for the Legislature to reverse certified votes cast by the Electoral College and counted by Congress .\nInstead , except in the case of presidential incapacity , impeachment is the only mechanism for removing a sitting U.S. President.\n\u201d Bernier is retiring at the end of this term , as is Steineke .\nA staff member in her office provided a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she wasn \u2019 t available for an interview about Ramthun \u2019 s bill and the \u201c unbelievable wildfire \u201d of disinformation it had set off .\nRamthun requested his own memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau , another nonpartisan research organization , about whether the legislature can recall electors .\nThat memo also concluded , accurately , that the legislature does not have that authority , but Ramthun annotated it with his own views and posted it online .\nHe has falsely said that Trump won Wisconsin in 2020 and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forensic audit \u201d \u2014 a nonsense term that has become popular among Trump supporters for their partisan , and occasionally ridiculous , investigations into the election .\nRamthun also appears to have some ties to the QAnon collective delusion ; he posted a video about his audit efforts this summer titled \u201c The Calm Before the Storm , \u201d referencing a common QAnon phrase , and he appeared on a QAnon-associated show to promote his election conspiracies , Media Matters reported .\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos , a Republican who authorized the audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week by taking away his only staff member after Ramthun said the speaker had signed a deal with Hillary Clinton \u2019 s lawyers to allow ballot drop boxes in 2020 , WisPolitics reported .\nGateway Pundit said Ramthun was brave and \u201c fearless \u201d in bringing up his bill Tuesday night and urged readers to reach out to members of the Rules Committee and \u201c tell them to put the resolution through.\n\u201d Spreitzer said Wednesday morning he was getting \u201c about an email every minute \u201d about the bill , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats contained in those messages .\nSpreitzer said it was clear that Ramthun \u2019 s supporters \u201c think he did something pretty heroic \u201d and he expects the Republican to try more antics to undermine the 2020 election in the future .\n\u201c For those of us who understood what was going on , it was sort of a fairly pathetic gesture , \u201d Spreitzer said , \u201c but I think he managed to pull the wool over the eyes of his fan club , and they think that he really accomplished something.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for comment .",

        "title": "Oath Keepers Founder Stewart Rhodes Has Been Ordered To Stay In Jail Until Trial For Seditious Conspiracy",
        "content": "PLANO , Texas \u2014 A federal magistrate has ordered Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes to remain in jail while he awaits trial for a series of charges including seditious conspiracy , citing his \u201c extreme defiance to federal authority \u201d and \u201c propensity toward violence.\n\u201d Prosecutors claim that Rhodes , 56 , \u201c spearheaded a conspiracy \u201d to prevent certification of the 2020 presidential election by encouraging the Oath Keepers to gather in Washington , DC , and to stash weapons and vehicles nearby for the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill protests that ended in a riot .\nIdentified for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Person One , \u201d Rhodes is described in charging documents as a fiery ringleader who allegedly began talking of violence and \u201c civil war \u201d just days after the 2020 election , spent some $ 40,000 on weapons and accessories prior to and following Jan. 6 , and attempted to destroy evidence of his involvement in the alleged plot after the fact .\nThe order was handed down late on Wednesday , two days after a hearing in federal court in Plano , Texas , where Rhodes has been held since his arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that he should not be released before trial , which has since been scheduled to begin July 11 in Washington , DC .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bIt is difficult to imagine conduct that poses a graver risk to our society than one targeted at undermining the laws and procedures at the heart of our democratic process \u2014 and doing so with force , \u201d Assistant US Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said before the packed courtroom .\nRhodes \u2019 attorney , Phillip Linder , argued that his client presented no danger to the community , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI agents who showed up with a search warrant to seize his phone last May and that he had even offered to travel to Washington to turn himself in should he ever be charged .\nLinder also questioned why the government waited so long to charge Rhodes , given that he had clearly been under scrutiny from investigators for nearly a year .\n\u201c To me , \u201d the Dallas-based attorney said , \u201c that speaks volumes.\n\u201d Reached by phone late Wednesday , James Lee Bright , Rhodes ' other attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her reasoning \u201d but that he was \u201c disappointed in the decision.\n\u201d That line of argument echoed conspiracy theories that have circulated widely in recent months suggesting that the government hadn \u2019 t charged Rhodes because he was an FBI informant and the entire Capitol riot was a false flag operation orchestrated by the government .\nAfter Rhodes was charged , some of those who helped spread those unproven theories said it was part of a cover-up to hide the truth about the Oath Keepers figurehead .\nRhodes , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale Law School but was later disbarred , founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 .\nThe group , whose numbers include many current and former members of law enforcement and the military , gets its name from the oath those individuals swear to uphold the Constitution \u2014 and to disobey any orders or laws they feel contradict it .\nOver the past decade , Rhodes has led the group into a series of tense , highly politicized confrontations , including standoffs with federal law enforcement at rural land rights conflicts in Nevada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killings of Black Americans in Missouri , Kentucky , and elsewhere .\nHe has also been criticized for leaving some of his followers to face legal consequences while he walked away untouched .\nA longtime resident of Montana , he \u2019 s lived mostly in Texas for the past several years , often staying in the homes of fellow members of the Oath Keepers .\nIn her ruling to keep Rhodes detained , Magistrate Judge Kimberly Priest Johnson noted that Rhodes reported not filing federal income tax since approximately 2007 , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with \u201c limited personal effects and ties to Texas or any other community.\n\u201d Rhodes , who has been separated from his wife for four years , has been in a relationship with attorney Kellye SoRelle since May 2020 , the magistrate wrote .\nSoRelle , who identifies herself as the Oath Keepers \u2019 general counsel , said earlier this month that she was acting as the group \u2019 s president while Rhodes was detained .\nSoRelle , reached for comment , denied being in a relationship with Rhodes , saying she suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wanting to get released to my house.\n\u201d Prosecutors allege Rhodes commanded operations of the Oath Keepers in Washington on Jan. 6 .\nThey say that though he did not enter the Capitol , he was on the grounds and in close contact with the roughly two dozen Oath Keepers members and associates who pushed their way into the building using military-style \u201c stack \u201d formations .\nHe also was in communications with members of a \u201c Quick Reaction Force \u201d that had stockpiled weapons across the Potomac River in Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District of Columbia .\nAt the end of that momentous day , Rakoczy noted , Rhodes gathered with other members of the Oath Keepers at an Olive Garden restaurant to celebrate .\nHe was indicted , along with 10 others , on Jan. 12 , and arrested outside of Fort Worth , Texas , late the following morning .\nOne of them , Edward Vallejo , was ordered detained last Thursday ; the other nine defendants had previously been charged in a related conspiracy case , and three have been behind bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , federal prosecutors have charged more than 725 people for their role in the events of Jan. 6 .\nBut there is little question that Rhodes is the most important target in what has emerged as the largest and most ambitious case to come out of the ongoing investigation .\nIn court on Monday , FBI agent Michael Palian testified about Rhodes \u2019 use of encrypted messages to direct the group and also said that the anti-government rhetoric he employed in the wake of the presidential election continued well after Jan. 6 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced by the defense \u2019 s argument that , based on his conduct over the past year , he was neither a flight risk nor a danger , she rejected a proposal to have him live with a \u201c third-party custodian \u201d \u2014 in this case a ride-hail driver from Dallas named Brian Bodine , who met Rhodes at a rally against COVID restrictions .\nAs an alternative , attorney Linder said , Rhodes could live at the house of a half cousin in rural California who could also serve as his custodian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive network of Oath Keepers members and other anti-government contacts means he is a flight risk who could \u201c go underground if he wanted to.\n\u201d Johnson agreed , stating that Rhodes \u201c is transient and may easily flee from federal authorities.\n\u201d Additionally , the magistrate said she took testimony after the Monday hearing from Rhodes \u2019 estranged wife , Tasha Adams , who said she \u201c feared for her safety and the safety of her six children \u201d if he were released .\nAdams , who lives in Montana and filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was physically abusive and in at least one instance \u201c choked the couple \u2019 s daughter , \u201d and that he built \u201c elaborate escape tunnels \u201d in their backyard , \u201c hid unregistered cars in the woods , \u201d and bought \u201c hundreds of dollars of razor wire \u201d that he intended to use to protect the property .\nThe detention ruling also confronted arguments on the right that the events of Jan. 6 amounted to nothing more than a First Amendment\u2013protected protest , or , as some have characterized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not faced with a peaceable assembly and petitioning , \u201d Johnson wrote .\nRhodes \u2019 \u201c extraordinary actions and the ripple effects that followed are outside the bounds of protected activities.\n\u201d Despite the magistrate \u2019 s ruling , Bright told BuzzFeed News that he planned to file a motion on Thursday morning asking Judge Amit Mehta in Washington to reconsider and grant Rhodes bond .\nMehta , who is overseeing all four of the Oath Keepers cases to come out of the Jan. 6 investigation , has allowed most of the roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay out of jail while they await trial .\nBut he denied bond to three individuals \u2014 Jessica Watkins , Kelly Meggs , and Kenneth Harrelson \u2014 whom he deemed too dangerous to be released last year .\nRegardless of whether Rhodes prevails in the matter of detention , his lawyer said he looks forward to taking the case to trial .\n\u201c An enormous amount of stuff that the public has never had the opportunity to hear is going to come out , \u201d Bright said .\n\u201c Unlike the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their context now , we \u2019 ll get the opportunity to challenge that .\n\u201d",

\u2019 m still alive .\n\u201c It looks like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning you \u2019 ve been fighting this on your own \u2014 with just your immune system , \u201d my infectious disease specialist said .\n\u201c We tested your cerebral spinal fluid after your last surgery and found zero evidence of the drugs.\n\u201d Half-elated , half-numb , I listened to her explain how she would switch up my medicine and try something new .\nThis was good news because it meant if the fungus were going to kill me \u2014 as it does to up to 70 % of its victims \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bad news because it meant I spent about three years taking completely ineffective medicine .\nThe barrier that this medicine must travel through , a semipermeable wall of cells between my blood and my brain , had allowed the fungus through \u2014 but now it \u2019 s been working in overdrive , keeping out much-needed medicine .\nI can only hope a new drug will finally punch through and rid me of this chaotic affliction , located at the intersection of two of the most mysterious living things : the fungal kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey to reclaiming normalcy has been fraught , it has taught me how to accept uncertainty .\nMy future remains murky , as soft and dusky grayish-brown as the fungus , Cladophialophora bantiana , itself .\nIn the winter of 2018 , life was good : I was 31 years old , the captain of an 80-foot schooner in Newport , Rhode Island , newly engaged to my partner , Liza , and riding bikes with her as much as I could .\nTo celebrate our engagement , we decided to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicoya Peninsula , located on the country \u2019 s Pacific Coast , is considered one of the most lush places on this planet .\nOur plan was to bike 20\u201330 miles a day and spend nine or ten nights sleeping on the beach .\nWe landed on New Year \u2019 s Eve and spent the night setting up our tents in the courtyard of a hostel while neighborhood fireworks exploded overhead .\nThe first few days of the trip were beautiful and the food was amazing \u2014 we ate fresh fish over rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothies .\nWe rode almost entirely on National Route 160 , a dirt and gravel road along the southern coast of the peninsula that is world-famous for its dust .\nWe wore bandanas around our necks , yanking them up over our mouths every time a car , truck , or motorbike drove by .\nOn the third day , we encountered a long stretch of beach riding , so I released some air from my tires .\nBack on the bumpy road afterward , I didn \u2019 t bother to pump them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill on the loose gravel , my back wheel slid out from under me and I was thrown from my bike , scraping up my arm and elbow pretty badly .\nNight was falling , so we made camp on a beach and I washed the gravel and dirt out of the wound .\nI bandaged myself up as best as I could and went to sleep in the tent .\nThe next morning , we found a walk-in clinic where a nurse named Linet spent the next hour picking detritus out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accidents like mine happen every day on the Nicoya Peninsula .\nThousands of people commute on these roads every day on mopeds , dirt bikes , ATVs , and motorcycles .\nShe removed the tiny pebbles from my arm with precision and expertise and sent us on our way .\nMy elbow healed up nicely with no infection \u2014 a tiny detour on an otherwise perfect adventure .\nA couple of weeks after returning home to the raw Rhode Island winter , I started noticing strange symptoms .\nI was having frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my facial muscles , making it hard to smile straight .\nI went to my primary care doctor and he was flummoxed by my symptoms , so he ordered an MRI .\nHe called me back the next day to tell me that there were \u201c some things \u201d we needed to talk about .\nIn his office , the MRI showed two lesions side by side in my head , two little dark circles of doom .\nMeanwhile , the headaches kept coming .\nI was abusing Advil and taking really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could .\nThere were various theories as to what my symptoms could represent .\nBecause Liza and I had gone on a similar bike trip in Mexico the year before , it was suggested that I might have cysticercosis , a disease that involves tapeworm larvae from undercooked pork getting into the brain .\nAfter that was debunked , I was tested for Lyme , tuberculosis , HIV , and various forms of brain cancer .\nThat spring I underwent two brain biopsies , but the surgeons couldn \u2019 t find anything conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my job as a ship captain because I was in so much pain that I couldn \u2019 t work in a setting that required me to be responsible for other people \u2019 s lives .\nInstead , I secured work with a nonprofit .\nIt \u2019 s so much easier to hide mysterious pains when you \u2019 re sitting behind a desk than it is when you \u2019 re front and center , trying to navigate a large sailing ship through a busy port .\nI probably shouldn \u2019 t have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less convinced that these pains were mysterious but temporary .\nThey would go away .\nThe job provided financial stability , but I was consumed with fear and uncertainty .\nWhat was wrong with me ?\nWhile I waited for the pain to go away , I began to take comfort in the readings of Buddhist teachers like Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n , who once wrote , \u201c when we resist change , it \u2019 s called suffering .\nBut when we can completely let go and not struggle against it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed drastically in less than a year .\nMy sailing career had abruptly ended .\nI didn \u2019 t know if I would ever be able to travel abroad again .\nWhereas before I was a strong and confident bike rider , now I was frequently falling over for no reason at all .\nIt seemed I had lost my balance along with everything else .\nEight months after my first symptoms , I went to Mass General for a third brain biopsy , and my neurosurgeon finally struck paydirt .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could literally see a dark fungus with her naked eye \u2014 a far cry from the cancer she had been determined to find .\nSamples were sent off to a lab in Texas and it was confirmed that I had an extremely rare tropical fungus called Cladophialophora bantiana , also called \u201c black mold \u201d because melanin gives it a dark coloration .\nIt is known to cause brain abscesses in humans but is so rare that only about 120 cases have been confirmed worldwide since its discovery in 1911 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many case reports describe how the long and difficult diagnosis process causes poor outcomes ( read : death ) .\nOf the total cases , around half were found in patients who were immunocompromised \u2014 some had organ transplants , one had HIV \u2014 and half in people with perfectly healthy immune systems like mine .\nBecause Costa Rica is a tropical country and because of our constant inhalation of dust and the injury after my accident , doctors and I were all but certain that this was the provenance .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cerebral black mold abscesses has been reported only when complete surgical resection was possible.\n\u201d Neurosurgeons ruled out excision in my case because the fungus was located too close to vital brain areas , so my team of doctors instead prescribed a combination of oral antifungal medication to attack the mold and a steroid to control the immense swelling and buildup of fluid in the brain it causes .\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier that the fungus passed through typically protects the brain from circulating pathogens in the body .\nAs a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see bloodborne infections take hold inside the brain .\nIn addition to the barrier , our brains bathe themself in a substance called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) that \u2019 s produced naturally .\nFor most people , excess CSF \u2014 a colorless liquid produced in all of the ventricles of the brain \u2014 is reabsorbed by the body .\nBut in my case , this doesn \u2019 t happen very effectively because of the fungus and the scar tissue , so the CSF collects , causing headaches , fatigue , fever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection is so rare and case reports so few , there isn \u2019 t much data or a \u201c playbook \u201d that my doctors can refer to for treating me .\nTo get a handle on the uncertainty of my diagnosis , I spent a lot of time reading as much as I could about black mold .\nIt \u2019 s as if I were looking for a scientist to tell me why this was happening to me .\nI should be out exploring the world , not laid up in a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making what sounds .\nI got so addicted to reading the scant information about my disease that was out there that my fianc\u00e9 , Liza , eventually begged me to stop , saying it was doing more harm than good \u2014 that the answers to my questions just couldn \u2019 t be found .\nA definitive diagnosis was something to hold on to , the first thing the doctors knew with certainty after months of confusion .\nBut it also prompted questions that no one could answer .\nHow did I get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from breathing dust on Route 160 or from dirt in the wound in my arm , or did it slip in through some intrusion I was n't aware of ?\nCan I ever get it out ?\nHow will this story end ?\nFrom the very beginning , my doctors placed me on a commonly prescribed steroid to control the headaches and pressure : dexamethasone .\nSteroids are amazing at controlling the inflammatory symptoms I was experiencing , but at the same time , their long-term use comes with a host of negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings , adrenal insufficiency , and immunosuppression .\nMy doctors called it a \u201c sledgehammer \u201d of a treatment and tried everything they could to wean me off these drugs .\nEach time , after a couple of weeks of steroid tapering , I would end up back in the hospital , desperately ill .\nThe immunosuppression really scared me at the start of the pandemic .\nHow would I possibly survive a bout with COVID if my immune system wasn \u2019 t working like it was supposed to ?\nHow long had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My faith in modern medicine was at an all-time low .\nAs a result of my fear of COVID , I decided to stop taking steroids without consulting anyone , thinking that I could continue my rehabilitation without them .\nI equate this decision with one that someone stuck in a burning building might make : either jump to the street below or be consumed by the flames .\nThey \u2019 re both pretty terrible choices , but I was tired of living in and out of medical care .\nTo take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of radical agency : Why hadn \u2019 t I done this sooner ?\nI honestly believed that this was going to work .\nIn late March 2020 , I had a stroke .\nThe day started off like all the other ones do in my new reality : My head felt like it was splitting open .\nA cacophony of pain accompanied my every movement .\nStrava tells me that I somehow went running that morning .\nBut then things got worse .\nThe pressure inside my head was intense .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision was going black .\nObviously , I should have realized that this was bad , but I kept telling myself that these sensations were temporary .\nI was so weak by the afternoon that I couldn \u2019 t get up the stairs to my apartment .\nI didn \u2019 t know at the time , but I was having the first of a series of mini strokes .\nLiza called 911 to take me to Rhode Island Hospital .\nLater , I would get transferred to Mass General , and then Spaulding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these institutions were under strict COVID-19 precautions .\nI was kept in solitary confinement for over a month while experiencing severe visual , vocal , and cognitive impairments .\nAs a result of the strokes , my eyesight was heavily affected by double vision and a reduction in my visual field , my handwriting was reduced to that of a toddler \u2019 s , and my speech rendered thick and gravelly .\nThe doctors told me later that the pressure inside my skull was 15 times the amount of pressure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I survived , I \u2019 d be completely blind , but when she got a text from me a few days later , she was filled with promise .\nIt has been just short of four years now living with this infection , and while I don \u2019 t have any expectations to be \u201c cured \u201d anytime soon , I do expect to live for a long time .\nI \u2019 m hopeful that the new drugs will work now that my doctors figured out that the previous drugs never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vision , voice , and fine motor skills will eventually return .\nIn order for me to get on a bike again , Liza and I bought a tandem .\nWe rode together frequently until I was able to get surgery to correct my double vision .\nEven though we \u2019 ll never know the real reason I got this fungus , I hate thinking that this whole chapter of my life was because I didn \u2019 t have enough air pressure in my bicycle tires .\nIt has to mean more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back .\nPeople commonly joke that they can \u2019 t remember what happened five minutes ago , and I \u2019 m here to say that is real for me : since my stroke , I can \u2019 t remember anything unless I write it down .\nIn the hospital , doctors would frequently ask me what year it was and I would answer \u201c 2017 \u201d very seriously .\nWhy 2017 ?\nIt was pre-fungus , I guess .\nLife was pretty good .\nThere is no cure for all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me while trying to keep it under control .\nI have lost my early 30s waiting in the hospital for test results to come back and procedures to happen .\nMy family and friends have spent these years keeping me emotionally , medically , logistically , and financially afloat .\nWhile this infection has been difficult for me , I realize it has been difficult in its own ways for them .\nNo one wants to see their loved ones in pain .\nPeople have pointed out that I should create a support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections like mine but the sad truth is that if I did , I would be the only member .\nEvery now and then , I reach out to someone I find on the internet with my affliction but they never respond .\nI would love to say that over the course of this illness I \u2019 ve met many wonderful people who serve as an inspiration to keep plodding along , but the sad truth is that everyone I \u2019 ve come across with my condition is now deceased .\nI would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that this experience has taught me to appreciate the times I \u2019 m not stuck in the hospital with a billion tubes poking out in every direction .\nIf anything , I \u2019 ve learned what it \u2019 s like to be on the forefront of scientific research .\nIt \u2019 s a lonely perch .\nBecause attending graduate school was something I wanted to accomplish before it was too late , I left my job and decided to enroll at the University of Rhode Island for my master \u2019 s in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been over a decade since I had completed my undergraduate degree there , and I reasoned that it would make sense for me to pursue this opportunity while I waited for my medical condition to become more stable .\nI finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA and am currently writing my thesis about offshore wind .\nWorking on this project has been a godsend : Instead of watching terrible movies on the hospital TV , it \u2019 s so much more gratifying to work on a project that might have real-world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brain has changed : I used to navigate across oceans by reading the stars , and now I have trouble finding the bathroom in my own home .\nI can write a 20-page paper without blinking an eye , but I have trouble navigating down the street .\nI often think back to the words of the Buddhist monks I read early on who try to teach us that nothing is fixed and that life is always in flux .\nI can \u2019 t escape the uncertainty around my future , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to live with it .\nLike my doctor said , none of this makes any sense , but it also doesn \u2019 t have to .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "We hope you love the products we recommend !\nAll of them were independently selected by our editors .\nJust so you know , BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nThanks to the utter travesty that is sex education in America and the lack of realism in porn or really any media depictions of sex , sexual pleasure can be hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you \u2019 re interested in taking the steps to learn what you might actually like , it may be time to bring on the sex toys .\n\u201c We still live in a culture that tends to normalize certain kinds of sex and make that expected for everyone , \u201d said Carol Queen , staff sexologist at Good Vibrations , a sex-positive adult toy shop founded in 1977 .\n\u201c Many people don \u2019 t understand even now that the clitoris , for people who have one , is the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany people think it \u2019 s the vagina , and while plenty of people love vaginal penetration , it \u2019 s not the primary way most people with vaginas orgasm.\n\u201d In fact , a 2017 study of more than 1,000 people ages 18 to 94 published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 % percent of people with vulvas could orgasm from internal stimulation alone .\nAside from targeting the clitoris , there are countless other ways to arouse people no matter what lies below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in nerve endings , so we can experience pleasure in our whole body , not just genitals , \u201d Brooklyn-based sex therapist Carolanne Marcantonio explained .\n\u201c Oftentimes we go right for the genitals , but there \u2019 s a whole world of pleasure to experience from head to toe.\n\u201d The number of nerve endings on your body vary , which is why some areas may feel more sensitive than others , but Marcantonio maintains that the brain is the largest erogenous zone .\nHow to find , choose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic interests and curiosity are the biggest guideposts to what they might like , \u201d said Queen , who has a PhD in sexology from The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality , in discussing how to find props that work for you .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re turned on to the idea of playing with just about anything , it \u2019 s a sex toy.\n\u201d That said , she emphasizes that it \u2019 s not safe to insert or use just any item you find around the house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting sex toy shops that were founded to make better quality sexual products available , especially to women .\nMarcantonio started her career on the sales floor at sex toy shop Babeland , which requires a monthlong training in the anatomy of pleasure and how to use appropriate language to respect customers \u2019 genders , expressions , and sexualities .\nVisiting a sex shop is a great way to find inspiration and consult with knowledgeable staff before making a purchase .\nIf you don \u2019 t find exactly what you \u2019 re looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different brands and types of products , you can then take your search online .\nThese days , you can also find sex toys at mainstream stores .\nIn the two years since Erica Minor became the marketing and communications manager , intimate lifestyle company Lelo has partnered with brands like Anthropologie , Urban Outfitters , and Neiman Marcus .\n\u201c We really work hard , especially with our marketing campaigns , to break down the shame and stigma around sex and pleasure but also provide representation , \u201d Minor said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been socially acceptable for a certain minority of the population to talk about sex and express themselves sexually , so we really want to open that up to everybody regardless of their sexual expression , gender identity , race , or sex.\n\u201d \u201c I love being able to introduce people to the many ways you can use these vibrators , \u201d said Julia Lopez , lead product engineer at Dame .\n\u201c People assume it \u2019 s just one way , but men love vibrators too.\n\u201d Queen agrees .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2014 anybody might like vibration , \u201d she said .\nIn terms of use , most modern sex toys are fairly versatile in how they can come into play , whether used solo or partnered .\n\u201c We \u2019 re only limited by how limited our creativity is , \u201d Marcantonio said .\n\u201c The sky \u2019 s the limit , so really anything can be a couple \u2019 s toy .\nAnything.\n\u201d There are also toys that target multiple erogenous zones to help facilitate blended orgasms , which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Blended orgasms are when more than one erogenous area gets stimulated at the same time , and it can increase the odds of orgasm or strong orgasm , \u201d Queen said .\n\u201c That thinking allows for us to sort of normalize and explore toys during intercourse or other kinds of sex play to add to the experience.\n\u201d Not only can incorporating toys into partnered sex lead to more satisfying experiences , but stepping outside of your comfort zone in a safe space may also have the added benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Exploring the building of trust and bonding and communication is also a heightened way to experience and build your coupledom , \u201d Marcantonio said .\nWhat materials are best for sex toys It \u2019 s essential for any sex toy to be made of something hypoallergenic and nonporous .\nSubstances that are able to break down or contain irritants should be avoided .\nThat list may include jelly rubber , which is made from polyvinyl chloride , or other compounds that could contain phthalates , which are potentially carcinogenic chemicals added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c A lot of sex toys have been made with that [ phthalates ] and because sex toys aren \u2019 t regulated , there 's no one telling companies not to use it , \u201d Lopez said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of on the consumer to make sure they are looking up what material the product is made out of , and pretty much every website will tell you what material it is , and then making sure that material is a stable nontoxic one.\n\u201d Experts agree that silicone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical-grade silicone , though borosilicate glass ( which is shatterproof ) and medical-grade stainless steel are also good options if you \u2019 re interested in temperature play .\nHowever , keep in mind that some types of lubricants can break down sex toys made of silicone , so use a water-based product in those cases .\nAnother perk of silicone is that you can sometimes boil them once you remove the motor for maximum disinfection , though in most cases a sex toy cleaner or mild soap and warm water will be sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a toy cleaner , Queen advises against using any with triclosan , which is an antibacterial compound that can be absorbed through your skin or mouth .\nToy cleaners are usable on those made from stainless steel or shatterproof glass as well , but the soap and water method should be sufficiently effective for any kind of waterproof sex toy .",

he \u2019 d also served as an official in the Justice Department \u2019 s antitrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watergate prosecution team , and as a lawyer to the Senate Judiciary Committee .\nHis nomination to the Supreme Court under former president Bill Clinton enjoyed bipartisan support ; the Senate confirmed him in July 1994 by a vote of 87\u20139 .\nBreyer didn \u2019 t share the reputation that fellow Clinton appointee Ginsburg had as a liberal firebrand and standard-bearer , but he routinely joined with the court \u2019 s liberal wing in high-profile fights .\nHe was a proponent of the idea of a \u201c living Constitution \u201d that evolves along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis typically embraced by liberals ;

loose gravel , my back wheel slid out from under me and I was thrown from my bike , scraping up my arm and elbow pretty badly .\nNight was falling , so we made camp on a beach and I washed the gravel and dirt out of the wound .\nI bandaged myself up as best as I could and went to sleep in the tent .\nThe next morning , we found a walk-in clinic where a nurse named Linet spent the next hour picking detritus out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accidents like mine happen every day on the Nicoya Peninsula .\nThousands of people commute on these roads every day on mopeds , dirt bikes , ATVs , and motorcycles .\nShe removed the tiny pebbles from my arm with precision and expertise and sent us on our way .\nMy elbow healed up nicely with no infection \u2014 a tiny detour on an otherwise perfect adventure .\nA couple of weeks after returning home to the raw Rhode Island winter , I started noticing strange symptoms .\nI was having frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my facial muscles , making it hard to smile straight .\nI went to my primary care doctor and he was flummoxed by my symptoms , so he ordered an MRI .\nHe called me back the next day to tell me that there were \u201c some things \u201d we needed to talk about .\nIn his office , the MRI showed two lesions side by side in my head , two little dark circles of doom .\nMeanwhile , the headaches kept coming .\nI was abusing Advil and taking really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could .\nThere were various theories as to what my symptoms could represent .\nBecause Liza and I had gone on a similar bike trip in Mexico the year before , it was suggested that I might have cysticercosis , a disease that involves tapeworm larvae from undercooked pork getting into the brain .\nAfter that was debunked , I was tested for Lyme , tuberculosis , HIV , and various forms of brain cancer .\nThat spring I underwent two brain biopsies , but the surgeons couldn \u2019 t find anything conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my job as a ship captain because I was in so much pain that I couldn \u2019 t work in a setting that required me to be responsible for other people \u2019 s lives .\nInstead , I secured work with a nonprofit .\nIt \u2019 s so much easier to hide mysterious pains when you \u2019 re sitting behind a desk than it is when you \u2019 re front and center , trying to navigate a large sailing ship through a busy port .\nI probably shouldn \u2019 t have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less convinced that these pains were mysterious but temporary .\nThey would go away .\nThe job provided financial stability , but I was consumed with fear and uncertainty .\nWhat was wrong with me ?\nWhile I waited for the pain to go away , I began to take comfort in the readings of Buddhist teachers like Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n , who once wrote , \u201c when we resist change , it \u2019 s called suffering .\nBut when we can completely let go and not struggle against it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed drastically in less than a year .\nMy sailing career had abruptly ended .\nI didn \u2019 t know if I would ever be able to travel abroad again .\nWhereas before I was a strong and confident bike rider , now I was frequently falling over for no reason at all .\nIt seemed I had lost my balance along with everything else .\nEight months after my first symptoms , I went to Mass General for a third brain biopsy , and my neurosurgeon finally struck paydirt .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could literally see a dark fungus with her naked eye \u2014 a far cry from the cancer she had been determined to find .\nSamples were sent off to a lab in Texas and it was confirmed that I had an extremely rare tropical fungus called Cladophialophora bantiana , also called \u201c black mold \u201d because melanin gives it a dark coloration .\nIt is known to cause brain abscesses in humans but is so rare that only about 120 cases have been confirmed worldwide since its discovery in 1911 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many case reports describe how the long and difficult diagnosis process causes poor outcomes ( read : death ) .\nOf the total cases , around half were found in patients who were immunocompromised \u2014 some had organ transplants , one had HIV \u2014 and half in people with perfectly healthy immune systems like mine .\nBecause Costa Rica is a tropical country and because of our constant inhalation of dust and the injury after my accident , doctors and I were all but certain that this was the provenance .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cerebral black mold abscesses has been reported only when complete surgical resection was possible.\n\u201d Neurosurgeons ruled out excision in my case because the fungus was located too close to vital brain areas , so my team of doctors instead prescribed a combination of oral antifungal medication to attack the mold and a steroid to control the immense swelling and buildup of fluid in the brain it causes .\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier that the fungus passed through typically protects the brain from circulating pathogens in the body .\nAs a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see bloodborne infections take hold inside the brain .\nIn addition to the barrier , our brains bathe themself in a substance called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) that \u2019 s produced naturally .\nFor most people , excess CSF \u2014 a colorless liquid produced in all of the ventricles of the brain \u2014 is reabsorbed by the body .\nBut in my case , this doesn \u2019 t happen very effectively because of the fungus and the scar tissue , so the CSF collects , causing headaches , fatigue , fever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection is so rare and case reports so few , there isn \u2019 t much data or a \u201c playbook \u201d that my doctors can refer to for treating me .\nTo get a handle on the uncertainty of my diagnosis , I spent a lot of time reading as much as I could about black mold .\nIt \u2019 s as if I were looking for a scientist to tell me why this was happening to me .\nI should be out exploring the world , not laid up in a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making what sounds .\nI got so addicted to reading the scant information about my disease that was out there that my fianc\u00e9 , Liza , eventually begged me to stop , saying it was doing more harm than good \u2014 that the answers to my questions just couldn \u2019 t be found .\nA definitive diagnosis was something to hold on to , the first thing the doctors knew with certainty after months of confusion .\nBut it also prompted questions that no one could answer .\nHow did I get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from breathing dust on Route 160 or from dirt in the wound in my arm , or did it slip in through some intrusion I was n't aware of ?\nCan I ever get it out ?\nHow will this story end ?\nFrom the very beginning , my doctors placed me on a commonly prescribed steroid to control the headaches and pressure : dexamethasone .\nSteroids are amazing at controlling the inflammatory symptoms I was experiencing , but at the same time , their long-term use comes with a host of negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings , adrenal insufficiency , and immunosuppression .\nMy doctors called it a \u201c sledgehammer \u201d of a treatment and tried everything they could to wean me off these drugs .\nEach time , after a couple of weeks of steroid tapering , I would end up back in the hospital , desperately ill .\nThe immunosuppression really scared me at the start of the pandemic .\nHow would I possibly survive a bout with COVID if my immune system wasn \u2019 t working like it was supposed to ?\nHow long had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My faith in modern medicine was at an all-time low .\nAs a result of my fear of COVID , I decided to stop taking steroids without consulting anyone , thinking that I could continue my rehabilitation without them .\nI equate this decision with one that someone stuck in a burning building might make : either jump to the street below or be consumed by the flames .\nThey \u2019 re both pretty terrible choices , but I was tired of living in and out of medical care .\nTo take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of radical agency : Why hadn \u2019 t I done this sooner ?\nI honestly believed that this was going to work .\nIn late March 2020 , I had a stroke .\nThe day started off like all the other ones do in my new reality : My head felt like it was splitting open .\nA cacophony of pain accompanied my every movement .\nStrava tells me that I somehow went running that morning .\nBut then things got worse .\nThe pressure inside my head was intense .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision was going black .\nObviously , I should have realized that this was bad , but I kept telling myself that these sensations were temporary .\nI was so weak by the afternoon that I couldn \u2019 t get up the stairs to my apartment .\nI didn \u2019 t know at the time , but I was having the first of a series of mini strokes .\nLiza called 911 to take me to Rhode Island Hospital .\nLater , I would get transferred to Mass General , and then Spaulding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these institutions were under strict COVID-19 precautions .\nI was kept in solitary confinement for over a month while experiencing severe visual , vocal , and cognitive impairments .\nAs a result of the strokes , my eyesight was heavily affected by double vision and a reduction in my visual field , my handwriting was reduced to that of a toddler \u2019 s , and my speech rendered thick and gravelly .\nThe doctors told me later that the pressure inside my skull was 15 times the amount of pressure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I survived , I \u2019 d be completely blind , but when she got a text from me a few days later , she was filled with promise .\nIt has been just short of four years now living with this infection , and while I don \u2019 t have any expectations to be \u201c cured \u201d anytime soon , I do expect to live for a long time .\nI \u2019 m hopeful that the new drugs will work now that my doctors figured out that the previous drugs never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vision , voice , and fine motor skills will eventually return .\nIn order for me to get on a bike again , Liza and I bought a tandem .\nWe rode together frequently until I was able to get surgery to correct my double vision .\nEven though we \u2019 ll never know the real reason I got this fungus , I hate thinking that this whole chapter of my life was because I didn \u2019 t have enough air pressure in my bicycle tires .\nIt has to mean more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back .\nPeople commonly joke that they can \u2019 t remember what happened five minutes ago , and I \u2019 m here to say that is real for me : since my stroke , I can \u2019 t remember anything unless I write it down .\nIn the hospital , doctors would frequently ask me what year it was and I would answer \u201c 2017 \u201d very seriously .\nWhy 2017 ?\nIt was pre-fungus , I guess .\nLife was pretty good .\nThere is no cure for all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me while trying to keep it under control .\nI have lost my early 30s waiting in the hospital for test results to come back and procedures to happen .\nMy family and friends have spent these years keeping me emotionally , medically , logistically , and financially afloat .\nWhile this infection has been difficult for me , I realize it has been difficult in its own ways for them .\nNo one wants to see their loved ones in pain .\nPeople have pointed out that I should create a support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections like mine but the sad truth is that if I did , I would be the only member .\nEvery now and then , I reach out to someone I find on the internet with my affliction but they never respond .\nI would love to say that over the course of this illness I \u2019 ve met many wonderful people who serve as an inspiration to keep plodding along , but the sad truth is that everyone I \u2019 ve come across with my condition is now deceased .\nI would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that this experience has taught me to appreciate the times I \u2019 m not stuck in the hospital with a billion tubes poking out in every direction .\nIf anything , I \u2019 ve learned what it \u2019 s like to be on the forefront of scientific research .\nIt \u2019 s a

sex education in America and the lack of realism in porn or really any media depictions of sex , sexual pleasure can be hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you \u2019 re interested in taking the steps to learn what you might actually like , it may be time to bring on the sex toys .\n\u201c We still live in a culture that tends to normalize certain kinds of sex and make that expected for everyone , \u201d said Carol Queen , staff sexologist at Good Vibrations , a sex-positive adult toy shop founded in 1977 .\n\u201c Many people don \u2019 t understand even now that the clitoris , for people who have one , is the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany people think it \u2019 s the vagina , and while plenty of people love vaginal penetration , it \u2019 s not the primary way most people with vaginas orgasm.\n\u201d In fact , a 2017 study of more than 1,000 people ages 18 to 94 published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 % percent of people with vulvas could orgasm from internal stimulation alone .\nAside from targeting the clitoris , there are countless other ways to arouse people no matter what lies below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in nerve endings , so we can experience pleasure in our whole body , not just genitals , \u201d Brooklyn-based sex therapist Carolanne Marcantonio explained .\n\u201c Oftentimes we go right for the genitals , but there \u2019 s a whole world of pleasure to experience from head to toe.\n\u201d The number of nerve endings on your body vary , which is why some areas may feel more sensitive than others , but Marcantonio maintains that the brain is the largest erogenous zone .\nHow to find , choose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic interests and curiosity are the biggest guideposts to what they might like , \u201d said Queen , who has a PhD in sexology from The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality , in discussing how to find props that work for you .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re turned on to the idea of playing with just about anything , it \u2019 s a sex toy.\n\u201d That said , she emphasizes that it \u2019 s not safe to insert or use just any item you find around the house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting sex toy shops that were founded to make better quality sexual products available , especially to women .\nMarcantonio started her career on the sales floor at sex toy shop Babeland , which requires a monthlong training in the anatomy of pleasure and how to use appropriate language to respect customers \u2019 genders , expressions , and sexualities .\nVisiting a sex shop is a great way to find inspiration and consult with knowledgeable staff before making a purchase .\nIf you don \u2019 t find exactly what you \u2019 re looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different brands and types of products , you can then take your search online .\nThese days , you can also find sex toys at mainstream stores .\nIn the two years since Erica Minor became the marketing and communications manager , intimate lifestyle company Lelo has partnered with brands like Anthropologie , Urban Outfitters , and Neiman Marcus .\n\u201c We really work hard , especially with our marketing campaigns , to break down the shame and stigma

the many ways you can use these vibrators , \u201d said Julia Lopez , lead product engineer at Dame .\n\u201c People assume it \u2019 s just one way , but men love vibrators too.\n\u201d Queen agrees .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2014 anybody might like vibration , \u201d she said .\nIn terms of use , most modern sex toys are fairly versatile in how they can come into play , whether used solo or partnered .\n\u201c We \u2019 re only limited by how limited our creativity is , \u201d Marcantonio said .\n\u201c The sky \u2019 s the limit , so really anything can be a couple \u2019 s toy .\nAnything.\n\u201d There are also toys that target multiple erogenous zones to help facilitate blended orgasms , which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Blended orgasms are when more than one erogenous area gets stimulated at the same time , and it can increase the odds of orgasm or strong orgasm , \u201d Queen said .\n\u201c That thinking allows for us to sort of normalize and explore

your coupledom , \u201d Marcantonio said .\nWhat materials are best for sex toys It \u2019 s essential for any sex toy to be made of something hypoallergenic and nonporous .\nSubstances that are able

potentially carcinogenic chemicals added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c A lot of sex toys have been made with that [ phthalates ] and because sex toys aren \u2019 t regulated , there 's no one telling

tell you what material it is , and then making sure that material is a stable nontoxic one.\n\u201d Experts agree that silicone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical-grade silicone , though borosilicate glass ( which is shatterproof ) and medical-grade stainless steel are also good options if you \u2019 re interested in temperature play .\nHowever , keep in mind that some types of lubricants can break down sex toys made of silicone , so use a water-based product in those cases .\nAnother perk of silicone is that you can sometimes boil them once you remove the motor for maximum disinfection , though in most cases a sex toy cleaner or mild soap and warm water will be sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a toy cleaner , Queen advises against using any with triclosan , which is an antibacterial compound that can be absorbed through your skin or mouth .\nToy cleaners are usable on those made from stainless steel or shatterproof glass as well , but the soap and water method should be sufficiently effective for any kind of waterproof sex toy .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Long before the news this week that Justice Stephen Breyer would step down , President Joe Biden \u2019 s campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman for the US Supreme Court provided a focal point for liberal groups hoping to keep up the Trump-era momentum they built around the future of the courts .\nThen-candidate Biden \u2019 s Supreme Court commitment in early 2020 gave his base plenty of lead time to build a strategy around the next potential vacancy .\nThe imminent confirmation push for whoever Biden chooses to replace Breyer will test how effectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base around the confirmation fight and keep them engaged in a critical election year .\nAt a White House event on Thursday honoring Breyer , Biden said he hadn \u2019 t made a decision yet about a nominee and would announce his pick by the end of February .\n\u201c I will select the nominee worthy of Justice Breyer \u2019 s legacy , excellence , and decency .\nWhile I \u2019 ve been studying candidates \u2019 backgrounds and writings , I \u2019 ve made no decision except one : the person I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , character , experience , and integrity and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court , \u201d Biden said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s long overdue.\n\u201d Biden first made the promise that he \u2019 d choose a Black woman for the high court at a February 2020 debate in South Carolina .\nLiberal groups that had spent four years opposing former president Donald Trump \u2019 s nominees for the federal courts \u2014 frequently highlighting the lack of racial , gender , and professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began boosting shortlists of potential candidates .\nThey pitched the potentially history-making nomination as a reason for Democrats to turn out to the polls in November 2020 and later , more controversially , for Breyer to step aside once Biden took office .\nIn the summer of 2020 , a group of Black women lawyers and activists launched She Will Rise , an advocacy project with a laser focus on building public support for a Black woman as the next Supreme Court nominee .\nBiden \u2019 s early commitment to choosing from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could focus on a grassroots campaign from the start , said Brandi Colander , one of the founding members .\n\u201c This really is a moment that we are grateful for because we believe the work that we \u2019 ve done to date has helped people understand the gap and the opportunity and the qualified women that are ready to fill a seat , \u201d Colander said .\nProgressive groups with a broader focus on issues that matter to women of color also took note of Biden \u2019 s pledge because , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She The People , it was clear that it mattered to the women they spoke to during listening sessions in swing states including Georgia , Texas , and Michigan in the lead-up to the 2020 election .\n\u201c Biden 's promise did n't come from nowhere .\nIt came as a response of public outcry .\nI heard it in the listening sessions .\nI have publicly repeated that demand on behalf of our network , both during the general and then after Biden and Harris took office , \u201d Allison said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that organizing around nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court was important , but now in the lead-up to the midterms and the 2024 election , she sees it as a real potential turning point for Democrats \u2014 \u201d having a Black woman is , or can be , a defining moment for the Biden presidency , \u201d she said .\n\u201c We 've seen some policy and political losses recently , \u201d she said , citing Biden \u2019 s failed voting rights reform bills , delays on criminal justice reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raised .\nThe significance of this issue for Allison , as the head of an organization that works to get women of color to the polls , is also that Biden nominating a Black woman to the court would give groups like hers a win to work with in a midterms year when voters are less likely to turn out , and with the Democrats \u2019 House majority hanging in the balance .\n\u201c It 's going to be an uphill battle to get the turnout that Democrats need to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win .\nWe need to win .\nThis would be a win , \u201d she said .",

        "content": "A nonsurgical N95 respirator is a mask designed to fit snugly around your nose and mouth with straps that go around your head ; it \u2019 s made of layered polypropylene , or plastic , fibers that effectively filter out 95 % of any bacteria or virus particles you or others breathe , cough , or sneeze out \u2014 if worn properly and consistently .\nThe material uses the power of static electricity to catch incoming germs or particles as air passes through the tiny spaces between the fibers .\nN95s are called \u201c respirators \u201d because they filter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like surgical masks , aren \u2019 t \u201c respirators \u201d because they can \u2019 t effectively filter the air you breathe ; they mostly help block large respiratory droplets that may carry germs from entering your mouth , like a snotty sneeze or phlegmy cough .\nThere are several different types and shapes of N95s ; some look like duck bills , others like domes , and several have three panels .\nThe main difference between nonsurgical and surgical N95s is that the latter are also fluid resistant to protect doctors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprays , Dr. David Banach , an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at UConn Health of the University of Connecticut , told BuzzFeed News .\nThe government is sending nonsurgical N95 respirators to the public because those are the masks that are available in the Strategic National Stockpile , the HHS spokesperson told us .\nBut there are similarly effective respirators , such as KN95s commonly sold at stores like Home Depot , that you could use as well .\nN95 respirators are regulated by the US with standards set by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIOSH ) , while KN95s ( and KF94s and others ) follow international standards , meaning they also should screen out about 95 % of germs and particles , but their effectiveness can vary between brands sold in the US .\nThat \u2019 s why Banach advises extra caution if you choose to wear these masks .\nThe CDC found that about 60 % of KN95s tested in 2020 and 2021 were less effective than advertised .\nThat said , many of the KN95s had a filter efficiency of 90 % or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtration efficiencies as low as 10 % to 20 % .\nBoth KN95s and KF94s offer the virus-catching electrostatic charge , so they should offer strong protection for you and others around you .\nLegitimate N95s are approved by the CDC \u2019 s NIOSH and will have specific markings , including the NIOSH logo or block letters on them to indicate their authenticity .\nKeep in mind that KN95s are not approved by NIOSH , so any claims to that effect suggests they are counterfeits .\nOther signs of counterfeit N95 respirators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes around your head , no markings on the filtering facepiece , and a missing or misspelled NIOSH mark .\nHere are some pictures of counterfeit respirators from the CDC and a full list of companies that make NIOSH-approved face respirators that are similarly or more protective than N95s .\nThe biggest complaint people make about N95s is that they can be hard to wear , particularly in hot conditions or when you have to exert yourself .\n( N95s with exhalation valves can help improve breathability , but experts strongly recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t filter the air you exhale \u2014 so they protect you , but not the people around you if you have COVID . )\nAlthough it may take a bit more effort to breathe through N95s , NIOSH tests have shown some of the respirators have better overall breathability than cloth or surgical masks , Karan of Stanford said , so it could take some time before you find the right type for you .\nOn the more comfortable side are the loose-fitting and disposable surgical masks , which can offer high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly ( secured over your mouth , nose , and chin with minimal gaps ) .\nThey are made of the same electrostatic material as N95s , but surgical masks don \u2019 t have the same fit or filters as their higher-quality counterparts .\nCloth masks could be anything from a scrap of T-shirt attached to two ear loops to a bandana .\nThe CDC and other experts say these options offer the least protection against the coronavirus , though there are ways to lock in more protection , like layering it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N95 \u2019 s protection compare to other masks ?\nIn its updated guidance , the CDC says well-fitting N95 respirators give the best protection for yourself and others , followed by KN95s and surgical masks , then cloth masks .\nN95s and KN95s are about 90\u201395 % or more protective against virus particles ( but remember it could vary with KN95s ) , while surgical masks stand in the 50\u201360 % range , Karan said .\nIf you layer them with a cloth mask , you can reach between 70\u201375 % protection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little as 20-40 % effective , he added .",

        "content": "When you woke up to the news that there was a potentially dangerous new COVID variant called Omicron \u2014 a comic book villain name if there ever was one \u2014 you may have felt some things .\nYou might have had a heavy heart .\nFelt depressed .\nOr maybe that tiny , tiny bubble of hope that was growing , the thought that we may have turned a pandemic corner and things would get better , abruptly burst .\nThe news is hitting at a time , at least in the United States , that is generally about family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others .\nAs an added layer of bleakness , the news was also a blunt reminder that despite the availability of safe and effective boosters in the US , much of the planet doesn \u2019 t have access to any type of COVID vaccine at all .\n\u201c The pandemic has made people feel traumatized and vulnerable and this Omicron is like a trigger , as it would be for any traumatic situation , \u201d said Dr. Vivian Pender , president of the American Psychiatric Association .\nPender said when the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her patients started calling almost immediately .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen them to be more anxious than they have been before , even to the point of panic , \u201d she said .\n\u201c When these variants come up , with Delta and now even more so with Omicron , it \u2019 s sort of this re-experiencing of the whole 20 months of this , \u201d said Dr. Ashley Matskevich , a Boston-based psychiatrist who is also on the faculty at Harvard Medical School .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We asked mental health experts for tips and advice on how to deal with the latest in a seemingly never-ending wave of not-great pandemic news .\nCheck in with yourself Every person reacts differently to the news and there \u2019 s no right or wrong way to feel .\nYou may feel anxious , afraid , numb , annoyed , or in denial .\nYou might have even laughed at the utter ludicrousness of the situation .\nJust about every emotional reaction is normal , Matskevich said .\nHowever , it helps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I think COVID , and especially Omicron now , can heighten existing problems , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really much easier to feel happy in your relationship and friendships on a fair weather day.\n\u201d It can affect your mood and how you feel and act toward other people , so it helps to try to remember that as you interact with people , she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not your spouse who 's the idiot for not being upset about not being able to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a really challenging situation.\n\u201d Focus on things you can control One thing that \u2019 s certain \u2014 there \u2019 s much that is outside our control , and that includes new COVID variants .\n\u201c There is the idea of how much this pandemic has taken from us and a really legitimate fear about what else it will take , \u201d Matskevich said .\n\u201c There are so many things coming that people are looking forward to and it \u2019 s really devastating to think we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommends focusing on the things that you can control , such as wearing a mask when indoors , getting vaccinated , and scheduling a booster if you are eligible .\nBe aware of things that might trigger anxiety Matskevich recommends that you notice your reactions to triggers and make behavioral modifications that help you look out for yourself .\nShe said she initially signed up for a daily roundup of COVID news until she found that it was a problem for her .\n\u201c I realized that every day at 6 p.m. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mood tanked , \u201d she said .\nShe unsubscribed from the email , and \u201c it did really help , \u201d she said .\nShe noted that \u201c it \u2019 s tough \u201d because it goes against our impulse to stay informed during a situation that appears threatening .\nHowever , we also won \u2019 t really know for a few weeks how dangerous Omicron is , or how protective current vaccines are against it .\nThere is no reason to be endlessly on your phone refreshing news feeds , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place limits on myself in that way.\n\u201d One coping technique is to schedule a time to get updates on what \u2019 s happening with the pandemic .\nWorry postponement is \u201c essentially saying , yes I can worry about this , I can doomscroll or whatever it is , but it will be 4 p.m. on Friday , \u201d Matskevich said .\nEndlessly reading \u201c a million news articles \u201d can interrupt sleep and lead to sleep deprivation , anxiety , and depression , and reduce the chances that you will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said .\n\u201c I almost view it as like a news pandemic and a COVID pandemic in terms of the impact on mental health , \u201d says Matskevich .\nRecognize when you are ruminating Rumination is an endless cycle of negative thoughts , a bit like a hamster running on a wheel .\nIt can contribute to anxiety and depression , but you might not even be aware that you are doing it .\n\u201c Journaling can be really helpful for that , \u201d Matskevich said .\nIf therapy is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cycle of repetitive negative thoughts .\nOther than that , strategic distractions , like getting into work , reading , and exercising , are all helpful and healthy coping behaviors when it comes to halting rumination , she said .\nCatastrophizing is imagining the most extreme and worst possible scenario in any given situation .\nFor example , if you have an ache or pain , you immediately think you have cancer , or if you have a fight with your partner , you assume that you will break up and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf you find yourself going there , try giving yourself a reality check , aka a thought challenge , says Matskevich .\n\u201c Thought challenging is like swimming up-tide , \u201d Matskevich said .\n\u201c Say to yourself , is there any evidence that I can find that this might not be true ?\nOr is there any evidence I can find that the best-case scenario is also possible ?\n\u201d Pender says it \u2019 s also important to avoid potentially negative coping mechanisms .\nFor example , she recommends avoiding drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better .\n\u201c Using drugs or alcohol to deal with stress makes it worse in the long run , \u201d she said .\n\u201c In psychiatry , we talk about looking at your own evidence , \u201d she said .\nIt helps to realize that we \u2019 ve gotten through this before and \u201c we \u2019 ve still landed on the other side , and gone to dinner with friends and gone to events , \u201d she said .\nBy contextualizing the news , it \u2019 s a reminder that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said .\nIt \u2019 s important not to lose sight of the great scientific accomplishments that have been achieved in terms of vaccines and treatments , as well as \u201c how people have weathered this incredible challenge , \u201d said Dr. Reynold A. Panettieri Jr. , vice chancellor for translational medicine and science at Rutgers University .\n\u201c If we look at challenges in the world , World War II was seven years , and we are starting our second year , \u201d he said .\n\u201c We are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have to do it on terms that the virus dictates , not necessarily our terms.\n\u201d It \u2019 s OK to temporarily distract yourself by binge-watching a show , reading a book or doing some activity to take your mind off the news .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a great coping mechanism to be distracted by something warm and fuzzy , \u201d Pender said .\n\u201c People who have pets are in a good position.\n\u201d Matskevich recommends that people choose an activity outside work that is also ongoing , enjoyable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into distance running for her mental health , but other ideas could be trying every recipe in a cookbook or knitting a sweater .\n\u201c Having something that feels motivating and purposeful but also enjoyable is really important , \u201d she said .\nIt \u2019 s more important than ever to connect with other people , Pender said .\n\u201c Loneliness is really hurting people , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Now is the time to expand your social network as much as possible.\n\u201d If you are feeling burned out or overly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , family , and colleagues so you don \u2019 t feel like you are alone and isolated , Pender said .\nYou will probably find a lot of people are feeling the same way you are .\nTake care of yourself or others It \u2019 s important to get enough sleep , eat well , exercise , or do anything else that \u2019 s healthy and can make you feel better , Pender said .\nYou can try mindfulness , breathing exercises , or meditation .\n\u201c Even just taking a walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something altruistic can also help , such as working at a soup kitchen or taking calls at a mental health hotline .\n\u201c If you are in a position to do that , you should do it , \u201d Pender said .\n\u2018 It helps you feel better.\n\u201d If none of these are helping , or aren \u2019 t helping enough , experts recommend you seek help with a mental health professional .\n\u201c If somebody is ruminating so much that they are not able to engage in relationships or they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they should get a consultation with a psychiatrist or a primary care provider who can refer to a psychiatrist , \u201d Pender said .\n\u201c There 's no one on this earth , if they are open to it , who would not benefit from an hour a week of therapy , \u201d Matsekvich said .\n\u201c Life is hard and therapy is great.\n\u201d The pandemic has changed one thing for the better \u2014 more mental health professionals offer virtual visits , which can hopefully make it easier to get help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely be a combination of virtual and in-person visits .\n\u201c For many , it \u2019 s made mental health care more accessible , \u201d Pender said .\n\u201c Telehealth is here to stay.\n\u201d The US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 .\nThe Trevor Project , which provides help and suicide-prevention resources for LGBTQ youth , is 1-866-488-7386 .\nFind other international suicide helplines at Befrienders Worldwide ( befrienders.org ) .",

        "content": "So when two women showed up at the National Butterfly Center last Friday asking to see \u201c the illegals crossing on rafts , \u201d Trevi\u00f1o-Wright said , her son at the front desk quickly knew what was going on .\nThe women identified themselves as Kimberly Lowe , who is running for Congress in Virginia , and a person whom Kimberly referred to as \u201c Michelle , \u201d and identified herself as a Secret Service agent in an audio recording , but whose identity BuzzFeed News could not verify .\nAccording to an affidavit that he later prepared for police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the women that they needed to pay an admission fee to enter the property .\nMichelle , he wrote , told him that she was with the Secret Service and that both women had big sway in Washington , DC , and they wanted to see \u201c the immigrants crossing on the rafts.\n\u201d Trevi\u00f1o-Wright said her son came to get her and that she googled Lowe before approaching the women .\nShe provided BuzzFeed News with an audio recording of her interaction with Lowe and Michelle , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted of the incident as it took place , which has since been deleted .\nIn the audio recording , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright quickly tells the women their \u201c agenda is not welcome here \u201d and asks them to leave .\n\u201c So you \u2019 re not for keeping the illegals out ?\n\u201d Michelle counters .\nLowe jumps in as well : \u201c So you \u2019 re not for helping all these poor people in the humanitarian crisis ?\nYou \u2019 re OK with children being sex trafficked and raped and murdered ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lowe agrees , but not before adding , \u201c I 'm sorry that you 're okay with children being raped and murdered.\n\u201d From there , things appear to devolve .\nMichelle again insists she \u2019 s with the Secret Service and they leave the building .\nOutside , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright says , Lowe started trying to record her .\nTrevi\u00f1o-Wright told BuzzFeed News she \u2019 s had her photo posted online by right-wing trolls and faced threats of doxxing , so she really didn \u2019 t want Lowe to record her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone .\nLowe says she took the phone .\nThen , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright says Michelle pushed her to the ground .\nLowe says Trevi\u00f1o-Wright fell .\nEither way , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright ended up on the ground and Michelle clearly says on the audio , \u201c Stay the fuck down , bitch.\n\u201d Lowe then made a run for her car where she started up the now-deleted Facebook Live video and started screaming for Michelle to get in the car with her .\nOnce Michelle is inside the car , she points out that Nicholas is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the video , the camera is pointed at Lowe as she hits the gas and the engine revs .\nMichelle yells , \u201c Whoa whoa whoa , KC !\n\u201d Lowe looks forward shouting , \u201c Get the fuck out of my way .\nGet out of my fucking way .\nGet the fuck out of my way .\nJesus Christ.\n\u201d Nicholas wrote in his affidavit to police that he had to jump out of the way of the car to avoid being hit .\nHe wrote that he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women from leaving before police arrived and because he believed they had his mother \u2019 s phone .\nLowe denied that she tried to hit Nicholas and accused the Wrights of assault and \u201c kidnapping \u201d for trying to prevent them from leaving and attempting to close the gate .\nLowe also sent BuzzFeed News a copy of her Facebook Live video , but a version that cuts off before she speeds up the car toward the gate .\nShe said she took it down because of \u201c an investigation.\n\u201d \u201d I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son to hit him period , \u201d Lowe wrote in a text to BuzzFeed News , adding that she had her children with her .\n\u201c I was trying to escape to safety with my children and did not attempt to hit him !\n!\n\u201d Asked why she went to the butterfly center in the first place and accused Trevi\u00f1o-Wright of allowing sex trafficking , Lowe said via text , \u201c Someone suggested I walk to the river to see what may be happening .\nI came to TX to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she is planning to join a \u201c private border tour \u201d this weekend featuring Michael Flynn , Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser and one of the biggest proponents of 2020 election conspiracy theories , as part of the pro-Trump events near the butterfly center .\nBut Lowe emphasized that the event was not the reason for her trip .\nLowe repeatedly said that Trevi\u00f1o-Wright 's story was a \u201c politically motivated attack \u201d against her .\nAnd she did not answer when asked multiple times whether Michelle has any affiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last name .\n\u201c I 'm a good person with a big heart putting myself out there to truly help people \u2014 I do n't deserve this mess from her , \u201d she said in a text .\nBoth women said that they spoke to Mission , Texas , police about the incident .\nLowe said in a text that she was \u201c cleared \u201d by police , but the police department did not respond to a request for comment on whether the case is still open or for copies of police reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witness .\nBob Axford , a Canadian man who said he is snowbirding in Texas for the winter , was standing in the parking lot as the scene played out and confirmed many of the details provided by Trevi\u00f1o-Wright and her son .\nAxford told BuzzFeed News he did not know any of the people involved in the altercation and had never been to the National Butterfly Center before Friday ; he \u2019 d just dropped by to confirm its location and grab a map of the property ahead of a planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the women as they talked with

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden on Thursday repeated his pledge to nominate the first Black woman for the US Supreme Court now that Justice Stephen Breyer plans to step down .\nIt \u2019 s a move that underscores not only the historic lack of diversity on the high court , but also just how much women and people of color , and especially women of color , have been dramatically underrepresented in the federal judiciary \u2019 s 232-year history .\nThe lack of racial and gender diversity on the bench is often most noticeable when it comes to the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justices who have served compared to the rest of the court system and their much higher public profile .\nJust three of the 115 justices have been Black or Latinx : the late justice and pioneering civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall , and sitting Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor .\nBut the numbers aren \u2019 t much better in the lower courts , where 1.8 % of federal judges to have ever served have been Black women \u2014 70 out of 3,840 \u2014 and 3.4 % have been women of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public database .\nRepresentation has improved in the past few decades but continues to lag .\nBlack women make up approximately 7.4 % of the US population , according to BuzzFeed News \u2019 analysis of census data .\nThere are 1,395 sitting federal judges , a number that includes judges who are fully active as well as judges in a type of quasi-retirement known as senior status who have the option of smaller caseloads .\nOf the current cohort , 56 judges are Black women \u2014 making up 4 % of the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being multiracial \u2014 and a total of 114 are women of color , making up just over 8 % .\nJudges who identify solely as white make up 78.5 % of the federal bench , compared to 61.6 % of the total US population , according to the 2020 Census .\nOn the federal appeals courts , representation of women of color has gone up by just a few percentage points as well .\nOf the 809 appellate judges to have ever served , 13 have been Black women \u2014 making up 1.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been women of color , making up 2.9 % .\nOut of 293 federal appeals court judges serving today , 10 are Black women , making up 3.4 % , out of 20 women of color , coming to 6.8 % .\n\u201c You have a situation where our highest courts do not at all reflect our communities , the diversity of our communities , and particularly so when it comes to Black women , \u201d said Juvaria Khan , the founder of the Appellate Project , an initiative launched in 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing in the appeals courts with an eye to creating more pipelines to judgeships .\nJudges of color have long talked about how having courts reflect the communities they serve builds public trust and deepens the wealth of expertise they can draw on in making decisions .\nAt a panel discussion last year , 6th Circuit Judge Bernice Donald , one of the few Black women on the federal appellate bench , explained : \u201c We as judges will always follow the law but ... justice is informed by our perspectives .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are driven by our life experiences ; rather , they add different angles from which to look at an issue or question . ''\nUS District Judge Carlton Reeves , who sits in Jackson , Mississippi , said at the same event that the judiciary faced a \u201c crisis of legitimacy \u201d if it failed to catch up to the demographics of the country .\nThere are three judges widely considered to be frontrunners for Justice Stephen Breyer \u2019 s seat ; he \u2019 s disclosed that he intends to step down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term this summer , assuming a successor is confirmed .\nTwo of those judges are on the federal bench : Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and US District Judge J.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration is quietly continuing a little-known Trump-era pilot program that clears the way for doctors and private health insurers to switch patients from Medicare to privately run insurance .\nThough there has been little public discussion of the program , it has the potential to expand to the wholesale privatization of Medicare .\nProgressive lawmakers and doctor and patient groups are now scrutinizing the program , after a year of it flying under the radar .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s a lot of interest in stopping this , \u201d Rep. Jan Schakowsky said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who chose Medicare is scandalous .\nWe can \u2019 t let that happen.\n\u201d Despite calls to shut down the pilot project , the Biden administration has no plans to do so .\nThe current plan is to run the program through the end of Biden \u2019 s term , potentially allowing a future president to expand its scope and further erode Medicare , the pillar of public healthcare in America .\nThe pilot program , known as direct contracting , allows for doctors to transfer their patients off of core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third party is paid a fee to manage their benefits .\nThe government says it will preserve patient benefits while experimenting with new ways to \u201c produce value and high quality health care.\n\u201d Opponents say it is a backdoor method of privatizing Medicare against the desire or consent of patients .\nFor decades , private insurers have pushed to get a piece of Medicare , the public health insurance program created in 1965 for people age 65 and older .\nThe government created a private Medicare stream in 1997 , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of money advertising such plans .\nThey \u2019 ve won over more than 26 million enrollees , making up more than 40 % of the Medicare population , to the over 3,500 Medicare Advantage plans , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .\nThe privatization of Medicare has been lucrative for the industry .\nMedicare Advantage plans are more expensive but have not been shown to provide better health outcomes .\nThat disparity grows wider every year .\nThe added costs born by the public to fund the program are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of dollars .\nAt a time when Medicare is facing insolvency in the near future , the more expensive Medicare Advantage plans are projected to soon overtake traditional Medicare .\nBut there remains one major hurdle to Medicare Advantage expansion : You have to convince enrollees to actively switch out of the default public plan .\nIn the waning months of his administration , then-president Donald Trump launched a program , lobbied for by private industry , to circumvent this .\nIt would allow insurers to bypass the will of patients altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professional Direct Contracting Model , the program allows insurers to negotiate with doctors to move their patients from straight Medicare plans to privately run insurance .\nDirect contracting flips the onus .\nInstead of patients having to actively choose to leave core Medicare , they are transferred by their doctor and only need to be told in an annual notification .\nThey may have to switch doctors to opt out .\nThe tactic is an experiment in finding new ways to lower costs at a time when Medicare is facing insolvency .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privatizing Medicare .\nOn the front end , insurers can buy ads advertising their plans to Medicare enrollees .\nOn the back end , they can try to sell doctors on moving their patients to private plans .\nWhen Biden took office , his administration faced the choice of what to do about direct contracting .\nAt the time it had not yet launched and was set to be far more sweeping .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s plan was for mass privatization of Medicare , with whole geographic regions being shifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input or ability to opt out .\nThe Biden White House shut down the so-called geographic stream .\nBut when it came to the rest of the direct contracting program , the Biden administration allowed it to go ahead .\nOne Democratic Senate aide said that because companies had already spent a substantial amount of money preparing for the program , his administration would have faced fierce industry backlash if they shut it down .\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) approved 53 companies across 38 states to kickstart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not saying how many people have been filtered into the direct contracting model but said that information will be released in the second quarter of 2022 .\nThe Biden administration essentially chose a middle ground .\nMedical industry companies were disappointed because new companies applying to be part of the program were frozen out .\nOn the other side , the group Physicians for a National Health Program wanted the program to be shut down altogether .\nBy neither closing nor expanding the program , the White House was able to mostly avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year .\nBut that is starting to change .\nEarlier this month , more than 50 progressive members of Congress signed a letter to CMS asking for the program to be shut down and patients to be returned to the traditional Medicare model by July 1 , 2022 .\nThe program is set to run for five years , from 2021 until 2026 .\nCrucially , that extends its life past Biden \u2019 s current term .\nIf a Republican wins in 2024 and is looking to increasingly privatize Medicare , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan from scratch .\nThey could simply expand the direct contracting model , which by then would be well established .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s any question that that would be part of the agenda if that happened .\nIt \u2019 s a good reason why this pilot program should not even be allowed to take off , \u201d Schakowsky said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s time for us to stop it before it really gets going.\n\u201d So far , that isn \u2019 t happening .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CMS spokesperson Raymond Thorn said his organization is considering public input .\n\u201c The CMS Innovation Center is actively listening to the comments being made about the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model , \u201d he said .\n\u201c This feedback is invaluable as we consider the future of the model.\n\u201d Thorn defended the pilot project by saying CMS was experimenting with \u201c opportunities to improve Original Medicare.\n\u201d He described direct contracting entities as \u201c doctors , hospitals , and other health care providers that work together to improve quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular Medicare , doctors are paid a fee for providing care to patients .\nUnder direct contracting , CMS pays a per-patient rate to what is known as a direct contract entity to manage care .\nIf these entities can deliver care at a cheaper cost , they reap a profit .\nIf not , they break even or take a loss .\nEntities can opt to take on 100 % of the profit/loss risk or split it 50/50 with the government .\nAs for patients , many may not even understand they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine out of ten people likely won \u2019 t understand the changes even if they are notified , said Michael Abrams , managing partner at Numerof & Associates , a healthcare consulting firm .\n\u201c This whole area is a bit of a mystery to most people .\nEven people in the industry , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And yet , there \u2019 s real money in this particular game .\nMore people will figure it out over time .\nWhether that is to the advantage or disadvantage of patients we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrams is hopeful that Medicare \u2019 s experimenting with paying doctors to manage care , instead of simply paying out fees for services , will lead to better health outcomes at a cheaper cost .\nBut it also comes with risk .\nThe per-patient rate paid in direct contracting is set based on factors like geography , past healthcare costs , and risk .\nA doctor diagnosing patients with more ailments ups their risk score and leads to higher payments from the government .\nAbrams said that risk score gaming in direct contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at a certain point would constitute fraud .\nOne thing he does not doubt is the potential for direct contracting to one day encompass Medicare , replacing the current model altogether .\n\u201c It depends on the way it plays out .\nIt depends on the way it \u2019 s implemented .\nBut yes , there is that potential , \u201d he said .\nDirect contracting is an expansion of an earlier experiment to allow doctors , hospitals , and other providers to coordinate care by joining up into networks .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , showing some improvements in customer care .\nThe key difference in direct contracting is that many of the companies are controlled by investors , rather than providers .\nThis brings an added profit incentive akin to the private health care market most people deal with .\nOne direct contractor , Clover Health , is a private equity-backed company that derives almost all of its revenue from Medicare .\nLast year short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accused Clover of deceptive advertising to seniors and hiding from investors that it was the target of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a dozen issues .\nClover \u2019 s stock fell but then became a meme stock on Reddit and was buoyed by a wave of small investors .\nClover recently told investors that it expects its number of direct contracting patients to grow significantly from its current 62,000 , and for profit margins on those customers to also improve .\nDirect contractor Oak Street Health told analysts on an earnings call that it expects direct contracting patients to bring in higher payments from the government than other Medicare patients .\nAlignment Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial upside but worried about the strength of the program .\nIf direct contracting ends up lasting , and expanding , companies that have a piece of the pie will become attractive targets for acquisition or private equity backing , at a time when the health industry is already seeing a frenzy of consolidation .\nWhether the program ends up as a short-lived experiment or the Trojan horse that leads to the wholesale privatization of Medicare may depend on what the Biden administration does between now and 2024 .\nWith one side calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other calling for it to be expanded , the current plan remains to keep it going as is and see how it goes .",

        "content": "I went on a vacation .\nI came home with a mysterious fungus in my brain that is so rare only about 120 cases have been confirmed worldwide since its discovery in 1911 .\n\u201c I honestly can \u2019 t believe you \u2019 re alive , \u201d one of my doctors told me a few months ago .\n\u201c It really makes no sense.\n\u201d I was sitting with my fianc\u00e9 in an exam room in the infectious disease wing of Massachusetts General Hospital , as I have countless times over the past four years .\nI was hearing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain defies expectations and baffles my physicians .\nI \u2019 ve fought this fungal infection with ten brain surgeries , five spinal taps , and two sets of cyborg-like tubes implanted to connect my brain \u2019 s ventricles to my abdomen .\nI \u2019 ve had a stroke , and with it serious impairments that have required me to relearn how to walk , talk , and read .\nNone of these procedures has removed the mold in my brain .\nBut I \u2019 m still alive .\n\u201c It looks like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning you \u2019 ve been fighting this on your own \u2014 with just your immune system , \u201d my infectious disease specialist said .\n\u201c We tested your cerebral spinal fluid after your last surgery and found zero evidence of the drugs.\n\u201d Half-elated , half-numb , I listened to her explain how she would switch up my medicine and try something new .\nThis was good news because it meant if the fungus were going to kill me \u2014 as it does to up to 70 % of its victims \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bad news because it meant I spent about three years taking completely ineffective medicine .\nThe barrier that this medicine must travel through , a semipermeable wall of cells between my blood and my brain , had allowed the fungus through \u2014 but now it \u2019 s been working in overdrive , keeping out much-needed medicine .\nI can only hope a new drug will finally punch through and rid me of this chaotic affliction , located at the intersection of two of the most mysterious living things : the fungal kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey to reclaiming normalcy has been fraught , it has taught me how to accept uncertainty .\nMy future remains murky , as soft and dusky grayish-brown as the fungus , Cladophialophora bantiana , itself .\nIn the winter of 2018 , life was good : I was 31 years old , the captain of an 80-foot schooner in Newport , Rhode Island , newly engaged to my partner , Liza , and riding bikes with her as much as I could .\nTo celebrate our engagement , we decided to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicoya Peninsula , located on the country \u2019 s Pacific Coast , is considered one of the most lush places on this planet .\nOur plan was to bike 20\u201330 miles a day and spend nine or ten nights sleeping on the beach .\nWe landed on New Year \u2019 s Eve and spent the night setting up our tents in the courtyard of a hostel while neighborhood fireworks exploded overhead .\nThe first few days of the trip were beautiful and the food was amazing \u2014 we ate fresh fish over rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothies .\nWe rode almost entirely on National Route 160 , a dirt and gravel road along the southern coast of the peninsula that is world-famous for its dust .\nWe wore bandanas around our necks , yanking them up over our mouths every time a car , truck , or motorbike drove by .\nOn the third day , we encountered a long stretch of beach riding , so I released some air from my tires .\nBack on the bumpy road afterward , I didn \u2019 t bother to pump them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill on the loose gravel , my back wheel slid out from under me and I was thrown from my bike , scraping up my arm and elbow pretty badly .\nNight was falling , so we made camp on a beach and I washed the gravel and dirt out of the wound .\nI bandaged myself up as best as I could and went to sleep in the tent .\nThe next morning , we found a walk-in clinic where a nurse named Linet spent the next hour picking detritus out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accidents like mine happen every day on the Nicoya Peninsula .\nThousands of people commute on these roads every day on mopeds , dirt bikes , ATVs , and motorcycles .\nShe removed the tiny pebbles from my arm with precision and expertise and sent us on our way .\nMy elbow healed up nicely with no infection \u2014 a tiny detour on an otherwise perfect adventure .\nA couple of weeks after returning home to the raw Rhode Island winter , I started noticing strange symptoms .\nI was having frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my facial muscles , making it hard to smile straight .\nI went to my primary care doctor and he was flummoxed by my symptoms , so he ordered an MRI .\nHe called me back the next day to tell me that there were \u201c some things \u201d we needed to talk about .\nIn his office , the MRI showed two lesions side by side in my head , two little dark circles of doom .\nMeanwhile , the headaches kept coming .\nI was abusing Advil and taking really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could .\nThere were various theories as to what my symptoms could represent .\nBecause Liza and I had gone on a similar bike trip in Mexico the year before , it was suggested that I might have cysticercosis , a disease that involves tapeworm larvae from undercooked pork getting into the brain .\nAfter that was debunked , I was tested for Lyme , tuberculosis , HIV , and various forms of brain cancer .\nThat spring I underwent two brain biopsies , but the surgeons couldn \u2019 t find anything conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my job as a ship captain because I was in so much pain that I couldn \u2019 t work in a setting that required me to be responsible for other people \u2019 s lives .\nInstead , I secured work with a nonprofit .\nIt \u2019 s so much easier to hide mysterious pains when you \u2019 re sitting behind a desk than it is when you \u2019 re front and center , trying to navigate a large sailing ship through a busy port .\nI probably shouldn \u2019 t have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less convinced that these pains were mysterious but temporary .\nThey would go away .\nThe job provided financial stability , but I was consumed with fear and uncertainty .\nWhat was wrong with me ?\nWhile I waited for the pain to go away , I began to take comfort in the readings of Buddhist teachers like Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n , who once wrote , \u201c when we resist change , it \u2019 s called suffering .\nBut when we can completely let go and not struggle against it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed drastically in less than a year .\nMy sailing career had abruptly ended .\nI didn \u2019 t know if I would ever be able to travel abroad again .\nWhereas before I was a strong and confident bike rider , now I was frequently falling over for no reason at all .\nIt seemed I had lost my balance along with everything else .\nEight months after my first symptoms , I went to Mass General for a third brain biopsy , and my neurosurgeon finally struck paydirt .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could literally see a dark fungus with her naked eye \u2014 a far cry from the cancer she had been determined to find .\nSamples were sent off to a lab in Texas and it was confirmed that I had an extremely rare tropical fungus called Cladophialophora bantiana , also called \u201c black mold \u201d because melanin gives it a dark coloration .\nIt is known to cause brain abscesses in humans but is so rare that only about 120 cases have been confirmed worldwide since its discovery in 1911 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many case reports describe how the long and difficult diagnosis process causes poor outcomes ( read : death ) .\nOf the total cases , around half were found in patients who were immunocompromised \u2014 some had organ transplants , one had HIV \u2014 and half in people with perfectly healthy immune systems like mine .\nBecause Costa Rica is a tropical country and because of our constant inhalation of dust and the injury after my accident , doctors and I were all but certain that this was the provenance .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cerebral black mold abscesses has been reported only when complete surgical resection was possible.\n\u201d Neurosurgeons ruled out excision in my case because the fungus was located too close to vital brain areas , so my team of doctors instead prescribed a combination of oral antifungal medication to attack the mold and a steroid to control the immense swelling and buildup of fluid in the brain it causes .\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier that the fungus passed through typically protects the brain from circulating pathogens in the body .\nAs a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see bloodborne infections take hold inside the brain .\nIn addition to the barrier , our brains bathe themself in a substance called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) that \u2019 s produced naturally .\nFor most people , excess CSF \u2014 a colorless liquid produced in all of the ventricles of the brain \u2014 is reabsorbed by the body .\nBut in my case , this doesn \u2019 t happen very effectively because of the fungus and the scar tissue , so the CSF collects , causing headaches , fatigue , fever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection is so rare and case reports so few , there isn \u2019 t much data or a \u201c playbook \u201d that my doctors can refer to for treating me .\nTo get a handle on the uncertainty of my diagnosis , I spent a lot of time reading as much as I could about black mold .\nIt \u2019 s as if I were looking for a scientist to tell me why this was happening to me .\nI should be out exploring the world , not laid up in a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making what sounds .\nI got so addicted to reading the scant information about my disease that was out there that my fianc\u00e9 , Liza , eventually begged me to stop , saying it was doing more harm than good \u2014 that the answers to my questions just couldn \u2019 t be found .\nA definitive diagnosis was something to hold on to , the first thing the doctors knew with certainty after months of confusion .\nBut it also prompted questions that no one could answer .\nHow did I get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from breathing dust on Route 160 or from dirt in the wound in my arm , or did it slip in through some intrusion I was n't aware of ?\nCan I ever get it out ?\nHow will this story end ?\nFrom the very beginning , my doctors placed me on a commonly prescribed steroid to control the headaches and pressure : dexamethasone .\nSteroids are amazing at controlling the inflammatory symptoms I was experiencing , but at the same time , their long-term use comes with a host of negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings , adrenal insufficiency , and immunosuppression .\nMy doctors called it a \u201c sledgehammer \u201d of a treatment and tried everything they could to wean me off these drugs .\nEach time , after a couple of weeks of steroid tapering , I would end up back in the hospital , desperately ill .\nThe immunosuppression really scared me at the start of the pandemic .\nHow would I possibly survive a bout with COVID if my immune system wasn \u2019 t working like it was supposed to ?\nHow long had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My faith in modern medicine was at an all-time low .\nAs a result of my fear of COVID , I decided to stop taking steroids without consulting anyone , thinking that I could continue my rehabilitation without them .\nI equate this decision with one that someone stuck in a burning building might make : either jump to the street below or be consumed by the flames .\nThey \u2019 re both pretty terrible choices , but I was tired of living in and out of medical care .\nTo take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of radical agency : Why hadn \u2019 t I done this sooner ?\nI honestly believed that this was going to work .\nIn late March 2020 , I had a stroke .\nThe day started off like all the other ones do in my new reality : My head felt like it was splitting open .\nA cacophony of pain accompanied my every movement .\nStrava tells me that I somehow went running that morning .\nBut then things got worse .\nThe pressure inside my head was intense .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision was going black .\nObviously , I should have realized that this was bad , but I kept telling myself that these sensations were temporary .\nI was so weak by the afternoon that I couldn \u2019 t get up the stairs to my apartment .\nI didn \u2019 t know at the time , but I was having the first of a series of mini strokes .\nLiza called 911 to take me to Rhode Island Hospital .\nLater , I would get transferred to Mass General , and then Spaulding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these institutions were under strict COVID-19 precautions .\nI was kept in solitary confinement for over a month while experiencing severe visual , vocal , and cognitive impairments .\nAs a result of the strokes , my eyesight was heavily affected by double vision and a reduction in my visual field , my handwriting was reduced to that of a toddler \u2019 s , and my speech rendered thick and gravelly .\nThe doctors told me later that the pressure inside my skull was 15 times the amount of pressure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I survived , I \u2019 d be completely blind , but when she got a text from me a few days later , she was filled with promise .\nIt has been just short of four years now living with this infection , and while I don \u2019 t have any expectations to be \u201c cured \u201d anytime soon , I do expect to live for a long time .\nI \u2019 m hopeful that the new drugs will work now that my doctors figured out that the previous drugs never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vision , voice , and fine motor skills will eventually return .\nIn order for me to get on a bike again , Liza and I bought a tandem .\nWe rode together frequently until I was able to get surgery to correct my double vision .\nEven though we \u2019 ll never know the real reason I got this fungus , I hate thinking that this whole chapter of my life was because I didn \u2019 t have enough air pressure in my bicycle tires .\nIt has to mean more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back .\nPeople commonly joke that they can \u2019 t remember what happened five minutes ago , and I \u2019 m here to say that is real for me : since my stroke , I can \u2019 t remember anything unless I write it down .\nIn the hospital , doctors would frequently ask me what year it was and I would answer \u201c 2017 \u201d very seriously .\nWhy 2017 ?\nIt was pre-fungus , I guess .\nLife was pretty good .\nThere is no cure for all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me while trying to keep it under control .\nI have lost my early 30s waiting in the hospital for test results to come back and procedures to happen .\nMy family and friends have spent these years keeping me emotionally , medically , logistically , and financially afloat .\nWhile this infection has been difficult for me , I realize it has been difficult in its own ways for them .\nNo one wants to see their loved ones in pain .\nPeople have pointed out that I should create a support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections like mine but the sad truth is that if I did , I would be the only member .\nEvery now and then , I reach out to someone I find on the internet with my affliction but they never respond .\nI would love to say that over the course of this illness I \u2019 ve met many wonderful people who serve as an inspiration to keep plodding along , but the sad truth is that everyone I \u2019 ve come across with my condition is now deceased .\nI would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that this experience has taught me to appreciate the times I \u2019 m not stuck in the hospital with a billion tubes poking out in every direction .\nIf anything , I \u2019 ve learned what it \u2019 s like to be on the forefront of scientific research .\nIt \u2019 s a lonely perch .\nBecause attending graduate school was something I wanted to accomplish before it was too late , I left my job and decided to enroll at the University of Rhode Island for my master \u2019 s in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been over a decade since I had completed my undergraduate degree there , and I reasoned that it would make sense for me to pursue this opportunity while I waited for my medical condition to become more stable .\nI finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA and am currently writing my thesis about offshore wind .\nWorking on this project has been a godsend : Instead of watching terrible movies on the hospital TV , it \u2019 s so much more gratifying to work on a project that might have real-world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brain has changed : I used to navigate across oceans by reading the stars , and now I have trouble finding the bathroom in my own home .\nI can write a 20-page paper without blinking an eye , but I have trouble navigating down the street .\nI often think back to the words of the Buddhist monks I read early on who try to teach us that nothing is fixed and that life is always in flux .\nI can \u2019 t escape the uncertainty around my future , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to live with it .\nLike my doctor said , none of this makes any sense , but it also doesn \u2019 t have to .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "We hope you love the products we recommend !\nAll of them were independently selected by our editors .\nJust so you know , BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nThanks to the utter travesty that is sex education in America and the lack of realism in porn or really any media depictions of sex , sexual pleasure can be hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you \u2019 re interested in taking the steps to learn what you might actually like , it may be time to bring on the sex toys .\n\u201c We still live in a culture that tends to normalize certain kinds of sex and make that expected for everyone , \u201d said Carol Queen , staff sexologist at Good Vibrations , a sex-positive adult toy shop founded in 1977 .\n\u201c Many people don \u2019 t understand even now that the clitoris , for people who have one , is the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany people think it \u2019 s the vagina , and while plenty of people love vaginal penetration , it \u2019 s not the primary way most people with vaginas orgasm.\n\u201d In fact , a 2017 study of more than 1,000 people ages 18 to 94 published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 % percent of people with vulvas could orgasm from internal stimulation alone .\nAside from targeting the clitoris , there are countless other ways to arouse people no matter what lies below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in nerve endings , so we can experience pleasure in our whole body , not just genitals , \u201d Brooklyn-based sex therapist Carolanne Marcantonio explained .\n\u201c Oftentimes we go right for the genitals , but there \u2019 s a whole world of pleasure to experience from head to toe.\n\u201d The number of nerve endings on your body vary , which is why some areas may feel more sensitive than others , but Marcantonio maintains that the brain is the largest erogenous zone .\nHow to find , choose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic interests and curiosity are the biggest guideposts to what they might like , \u201d said Queen , who has a PhD in sexology from The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality , in discussing how to find props that work for you .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re turned on to the idea of playing with just about anything , it \u2019 s a sex toy.\n\u201d That said , she emphasizes that it \u2019 s not safe to insert or use just any item you find around the house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting sex toy shops that were founded to make better quality sexual products available , especially to women .\nMarcantonio started her career on the sales floor at sex toy shop Babeland , which requires a monthlong training in the anatomy of pleasure and how to use appropriate language to respect customers \u2019 genders , expressions , and sexualities .\nVisiting a sex shop is a great way to find inspiration and consult with knowledgeable staff before making a purchase .\nIf you don \u2019 t find exactly what you \u2019 re looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different brands and types of products , you can then take your search online .\nThese days , you can also find sex toys at mainstream stores .\nIn the two years since Erica Minor became the marketing and communications manager , intimate lifestyle company Lelo has partnered with brands like Anthropologie , Urban Outfitters , and Neiman Marcus .\n\u201c We really work hard , especially with our marketing campaigns , to break down the shame and stigma around sex and pleasure but also provide representation , \u201d Minor said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been socially acceptable for a certain minority of the population to talk about sex and express themselves sexually , so we really want to open that up to everybody regardless of their sexual expression , gender identity , race , or sex.\n\u201d \u201c I love being able to introduce people to the many ways you can use these vibrators , \u201d said Julia Lopez , lead product engineer at Dame .\n\u201c People assume it \u2019 s just one way , but men love vibrators too.\n\u201d Queen agrees .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2014 anybody might like vibration , \u201d she said .\nIn terms of use , most modern sex toys are fairly versatile in how they can come into play , whether used solo or partnered .\n\u201c We \u2019 re only limited by how limited our creativity is , \u201d Marcantonio said .\n\u201c The sky \u2019 s the limit , so really anything can be a couple \u2019 s toy .\nAnything.\n\u201d There are also toys that target multiple erogenous zones to help facilitate blended orgasms , which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Blended orgasms are when more than one erogenous area gets stimulated at the same time , and it can increase the odds of orgasm or strong orgasm , \u201d Queen said .\n\u201c That thinking allows for us to sort of normalize and explore toys during intercourse or other kinds of sex play to add to the experience.\n\u201d Not only can incorporating toys into partnered sex lead to more satisfying experiences , but stepping outside of your comfort zone in a safe space may also have the added benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Exploring the building of trust and bonding and communication is also a heightened way to experience and build your coupledom , \u201d Marcantonio said .\nWhat materials are best for sex toys It \u2019 s essential for any sex toy to be made of something hypoallergenic and nonporous .\nSubstances that are able to break down or contain irritants should be avoided .\nThat list may include jelly rubber , which is made from polyvinyl chloride , or other compounds that could contain phthalates , which are potentially carcinogenic chemicals added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c A lot of sex toys have been made with that [ phthalates ] and because sex toys aren \u2019 t regulated , there 's no one telling companies not to use it , \u201d Lopez said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of on the consumer to make sure they are looking up what material the product is made out of , and pretty much every website will tell you what material it is , and then making sure that material is a stable nontoxic one.\n\u201d Experts agree that silicone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical-grade silicone , though borosilicate glass ( which is shatterproof ) and medical-grade stainless steel are also good options if you \u2019 re interested in temperature play .\nHowever , keep in mind that some types of lubricants can break down sex toys made of silicone , so use a water-based product in those cases .\nAnother perk of silicone is that you can sometimes boil them once you remove the motor for maximum disinfection , though in most cases a sex toy cleaner or mild soap and warm water will be sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a toy cleaner , Queen advises against using any with triclosan , which is an antibacterial compound that can be absorbed through your skin or mouth .\nToy cleaners are usable on those made from stainless steel or shatterproof glass as well , but the soap and water method should be sufficiently effective for any kind of waterproof sex toy .",

honestly can \u2019 t believe you \u2019 re alive , \u201d one of my doctors told me a few months ago .\n\u201c It really makes no sense.\n\u201d I was sitting with my fianc\u00e9 in an exam room in the infectious disease wing of Massachusetts General Hospital , as I have countless times over the past four years .\nI was hearing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain defies expectations and baffles my physicians .\nI \u2019 ve fought this fungal infection with ten brain surgeries , five spinal taps , and two sets of cyborg-like tubes implanted to connect my brain \u2019 s ventricles to my abdomen .\nI \u2019 ve had a stroke , and with it serious impairments that have required me to relearn how to walk , talk , and read .\nNone of these procedures has removed the mold in my brain .\nBut I \u2019 m still alive .\n\u201c It looks like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning you \u2019 ve been fighting this on your own \u2014 with just your immune system , \u201d my infectious disease specialist said .\n\u201c We tested your cerebral spinal fluid after your last surgery and found zero evidence of the drugs.\n\u201d Half-elated , half-numb , I listened to her explain how she would switch up my medicine and try something new .\nThis was good news because it meant if the fungus were going to kill me \u2014 as it does to up to 70 % of its victims \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bad news because it meant I spent about three years taking completely ineffective medicine .\nThe barrier that this medicine must travel through , a semipermeable wall of cells between my blood and my brain , had allowed the fungus through \u2014 but now it \u2019 s been working in overdrive , keeping out much-needed medicine .\nI can only hope a new drug will finally punch through and rid me of this chaotic affliction , located at the intersection of two of the most mysterious living things : the fungal kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey to reclaiming normalcy has been fraught , it has taught me how to accept uncertainty .\nMy future remains murky , as soft and dusky grayish-brown as the fungus , Cladophialophora bantiana , itself .\nIn the winter of 2018 , life was good : I was 31 years old , the captain of an 80-foot schooner in Newport , Rhode Island , newly engaged to my partner , Liza , and riding bikes with her as much as I could .\nTo celebrate our engagement , we decided to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicoya Peninsula , located on the country \u2019 s Pacific Coast , is considered one of the most lush places on this planet .\nOur plan was to bike 20\u201330 miles a day and spend nine or ten nights sleeping on the beach .\nWe landed on New Year \u2019 s Eve and spent the night setting up our tents in the courtyard of a hostel while neighborhood fireworks exploded overhead .\nThe first few days of the trip were beautiful and the food was amazing \u2014 we ate fresh fish over rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothies .\nWe rode almost entirely on National Route 160 , a dirt and gravel road along the southern coast of the peninsula that is world-famous for its dust .\nWe wore bandanas around our necks , yanking them up over our mouths every time a car , truck , or motorbike drove by .\nOn the third day , we encountered a long stretch of beach riding , so I released some air from my tires .\nBack on the bumpy road afterward , I didn \u2019 t bother to pump them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill on the loose gravel , my back wheel slid out from under me and I was thrown from my bike , scraping up my arm and elbow pretty badly .\nNight was falling , so we made camp on a beach and I washed the gravel and dirt out of the wound .\nI bandaged myself up as best as I could and went to sleep in the tent .\nThe next morning , we found a walk-in clinic where a nurse named Linet spent the next hour picking detritus out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accidents like mine happen every day on the Nicoya Peninsula .\nThousands of people commute on these roads every day on mopeds , dirt bikes , ATVs , and motorcycles .\nShe removed the tiny pebbles from my arm with precision and expertise and sent us on our way .\nMy elbow healed up nicely with no infection \u2014 a tiny detour on an otherwise perfect adventure .\nA couple of weeks after returning home to the raw Rhode Island winter , I started noticing strange symptoms .\nI was having frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my facial muscles , making it hard to smile straight .\nI went to my primary care doctor and he was flummoxed by my symptoms , so he ordered an MRI .\nHe called me back the next day to tell me that there were \u201c some things \u201d we needed to talk about .\nIn his office , the MRI showed two lesions side by side in my head , two little dark circles of doom .\nMeanwhile , the headaches kept coming .\nI was abusing Advil and taking really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could .\nThere were various theories as to what my symptoms could represent .\nBecause Liza and I had gone on a similar bike trip in Mexico the year before , it was suggested that I might have cysticercosis , a disease that involves tapeworm larvae from undercooked pork getting into the brain .\nAfter that was debunked , I was tested for Lyme , tuberculosis , HIV , and various forms of brain cancer .\nThat spring I underwent two brain biopsies , but the surgeons couldn \u2019 t find anything conclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my job as a ship captain because I was in so much pain that I couldn \u2019 t work in a setting that required me to be responsible for other people \u2019 s lives .\nInstead , I secured work with a nonprofit .\nIt \u2019 s so much easier to hide mysterious pains when you \u2019 re sitting behind a desk than it is when you \u2019 re front and center , trying to navigate a large sailing ship through a busy port .\nI probably shouldn \u2019 t have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less convinced that these pains were mysterious but temporary .\nThey would go away .\nThe job provided financial stability , but I was consumed with fear and uncertainty .\nWhat was wrong with me ?\nWhile I waited for the pain to go away , I began to take comfort in the readings of Buddhist teachers like Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n , who once wrote , \u201c when we resist change , it \u2019 s called suffering .\nBut when we can completely let go and not struggle against it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed drastically in less than a year .\nMy sailing career had abruptly ended .\nI didn \u2019 t know if I would ever be able to travel abroad again .\nWhereas before I was a strong and confident bike rider , now I was frequently falling over for no reason at all .\nIt seemed I had lost my balance along with everything else .\nEight months after my first symptoms , I went to Mass General for a third brain biopsy , and my neurosurgeon finally struck paydirt .\nShe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could literally see a dark fungus with her naked eye \u2014 a far cry from the cancer she had been determined to find .\nSamples were sent off to a lab in Texas and it was confirmed that I had an extremely rare tropical fungus called Cladophialophora bantiana , also called \u201c black mold \u201d because melanin gives it a dark coloration .\nIt is known to cause brain abscesses in humans but is so rare that only about 120 cases have been confirmed worldwide since its discovery in 1911 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many case reports describe how the long and difficult diagnosis process causes poor outcomes ( read : death ) .\nOf the total cases , around half were found in patients who were immunocompromised \u2014 some had organ transplants , one had HIV \u2014 and half in people with perfectly healthy immune systems like mine .\nBecause Costa Rica is a tropical country and because of our constant inhalation of dust and the injury after my accident , doctors and I were all but certain that this was the provenance .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cerebral black mold abscesses has been reported only when complete surgical resection was possible.\n\u201d Neurosurgeons ruled out excision in my case because the fungus was located too close to vital brain areas , so my team of doctors instead prescribed a combination of oral antifungal medication to attack the mold and a steroid to control the immense swelling and buildup of fluid in the brain it causes .\nThe blood\u2013brain barrier that the fungus passed through typically protects the brain from circulating pathogens in the body .\nAs a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see bloodborne infections take hold inside the brain .\nIn addition to the barrier , our brains bathe themself in a substance called cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) that \u2019 s produced naturally .\nFor most people , excess CSF \u2014 a colorless liquid produced in all of the ventricles of the brain \u2014 is reabsorbed by the body .\nBut in my case , this doesn \u2019 t happen very effectively because of the fungus and the scar tissue , so the CSF collects , causing headaches , fatigue , fever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection is so rare and case reports so few , there isn \u2019 t much data or a \u201c playbook \u201d that my doctors can refer to for treating me .\nTo get a handle on the uncertainty of my diagnosis , I spent a lot of time reading as much as I could about black mold .\nIt \u2019 s as if I were looking for a scientist to tell me why this was happening to me .\nI should be out exploring the world , not laid up in a hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making what sounds .\nI got so addicted to reading the scant information about my disease that was out there that my fianc\u00e9 , Liza , eventually begged me to stop , saying it was doing more harm than good \u2014 that the answers to my questions just couldn \u2019 t be found .\nA definitive diagnosis was something to hold on to , the first thing the doctors knew with certainty after months of confusion .\nBut it also prompted questions that no one could answer .\nHow did I get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from breathing dust on Route 160 or from dirt in the wound in my arm , or did it slip in through some intrusion I was n't aware of ?\nCan I ever get it out ?\nHow will this story end ?\nFrom the very beginning , my doctors placed me on a commonly prescribed steroid to control the headaches and pressure : dexamethasone .\nSteroids are amazing at controlling the inflammatory symptoms I was experiencing , but at the same time , their long-term use comes with a host of negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings , adrenal insufficiency , and immunosuppression .\nMy doctors called it a \u201c sledgehammer \u201d of a treatment and tried everything they could to wean me off these drugs .\nEach time , after a couple of weeks of steroid tapering , I would end up back in the hospital , desperately ill .\nThe immunosuppression really scared me at the start of the pandemic .\nHow would I possibly survive a bout with COVID if my immune system wasn \u2019 t working like it was supposed to ?\nHow long had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My faith in modern medicine was at an all-time low .\nAs a result of my fear of COVID , I decided to stop taking steroids without consulting anyone , thinking that I could continue my rehabilitation without them .\nI equate this decision with one that someone stuck in a burning building might make : either jump to the street below or be consumed by the flames .\nThey \u2019 re both pretty terrible choices , but I was tired of living in and out of medical care .\nTo take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of radical agency : Why hadn \u2019 t I done this sooner ?\nI honestly believed that this was going to work .\nIn late March 2020 , I had a stroke .\nThe day started off like all the other ones do in my new reality : My head felt like it was splitting open .\nA cacophony of pain accompanied my every movement .\nStrava tells me that I somehow went running that morning .\nBut then things got worse .\nThe pressure inside my head was intense .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision was going black .\nObviously , I should have realized that this was bad , but I kept telling myself that these sensations were temporary .\nI was so weak by the afternoon that I couldn \u2019 t get up the stairs to my apartment .\nI didn \u2019 t know at the time , but I was having the first of a series of mini strokes .\nLiza called 911 to take me to Rhode Island Hospital .\nLater , I would get transferred to Mass General , and then Spaulding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these institutions were under strict COVID-19 precautions .\nI was kept in solitary confinement for over a month while experiencing severe visual , vocal , and cognitive impairments .\nAs a result of the strokes , my eyesight was heavily affected by double vision and a reduction in my visual field , my handwriting was reduced to that of a toddler \u2019 s , and my speech rendered thick and gravelly .\nThe doctors told me later that the pressure inside my skull was 15 times the amount of pressure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if I survived , I \u2019 d be completely blind , but when she got a text from me a few days later , she was filled with promise .\nIt has been just short of four years now living with this infection , and while I don \u2019 t have any expectations to be \u201c cured \u201d anytime soon , I do expect to live for a long time .\nI \u2019 m hopeful that the new drugs will work now that my doctors figured out that the previous drugs never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my vision , voice , and fine motor skills will eventually return .\nIn order for me to get on a bike again , Liza and I bought a tandem .\nWe rode together frequently until I was able to get surgery to correct my double vision .\nEven though we \u2019 ll never know the real reason I got this fungus , I hate thinking that this whole chapter of my life was because I didn \u2019 t have enough air pressure in my bicycle tires .\nIt has to mean more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back .\nPeople commonly joke that they can \u2019 t remember what happened five minutes ago , and I \u2019 m here to say that is real for me : since my stroke , I can \u2019 t remember anything unless I write it down .\nIn the hospital , doctors would frequently ask me what year it was and I would answer \u201c 2017 \u201d very seriously .\nWhy 2017 ?\nIt was pre-fungus , I guess .\nLife was pretty good .\nThere is no cure for all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me while trying to keep it under control .\nI have lost my early 30s waiting in the hospital for test results to come back and procedures to happen .\nMy family and friends have spent these years keeping me emotionally , medically , logistically , and financially afloat .\nWhile this infection has been difficult for me , I realize it has been difficult in its own ways for them .\nNo one wants to see their loved ones in pain .\nPeople have pointed out that I should create a support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections like mine but the sad truth is that if I did , I would be the only member .\nEvery now and then , I reach out to someone I find on the internet with my affliction but they never respond .\nI would love to say that over the course of this illness I \u2019 ve met many wonderful people who serve as an inspiration to keep plodding along , but the sad truth is that everyone I \u2019 ve come across with my condition is now deceased .\nI would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that this experience has taught me to appreciate the times I \u2019 m not stuck in the hospital with a billion tubes poking out in every direction .\nIf anything , I \u2019 ve learned what it \u2019 s like to be on the forefront of scientific research .\nIt \u2019 s a lonely perch .\nBecause attending graduate school was something I wanted to accomplish before it was too late , I left my job and decided to enroll at the University of Rhode Island for my master \u2019 s in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been over a decade since I had completed my undergraduate degree there , and I reasoned that it would make sense for me to pursue this opportunity while I waited for my medical condition to become more stable .\nI finished my first year with a 3.7 GPA and am currently writing my thesis about offshore wind .\nWorking on this project has been a godsend : Instead of

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department on Friday notified the family of Tamir Rice \u2014 the 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer in 2014 \u2014 that officials would not reopen a federal civil rights investigation that closed in December 2020 .\nRice \u2019 s family last year launched Tamir \u2019 s Campaign to urge DOJ officials under the new administration to revisit the Trump-era decision .\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke , the head of the Civil Rights Division , wrote in a letter dated Jan. 28 to an attorney working with the family that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c tragic loss , \u201d but that they stood by the analysis of career prosecutors who concluded the government wouldn \u2019 t be able to prove a federal civil rights violation \u201c beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\u201d \u201c The United States Supreme Court has made clear that in prosecuting a Section 242 case , an officer acted \u2018 willfully \u2019 if he did so with bad purpose \u2014 that is , with the specific intent to do something the law forbids \u2014 to deprive a person of their constitutional rights .\nAfter viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this matter , in 2020 , career prosecutors determined that the federal government could not meet this high standard , \u201d Clarke wrote .\nClarke continued , underlining for emphasis , \u201c By no means should you view the Department \u2019 s 2020 decision as an exoneration of Timothy Loehmann \u2019 s actions , \u201d referring to the former Cleveland police officer who shot Rice .\nClarke wrote that the December 2020 decision to close the matter was \u201c based solely upon the applicable facts and law , without political input or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true for the conclusion to not reopen it .\nTamir 's mother , Samaria Rice , said she was angry and disappointed .\n\u201c I think they 're pitiful and pathetic , and at this point no one is going to get justice when it comes to police shootings in America , \u201d she said in a phone interview on Monday .\n\u201c It \u2019 s disgusting I do n't have an indictment for my 12-year-old son.\n\u201d Tamir had been playing with a toy gun outside a recreation center on Nov. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report that someone was pointing a gun at people .\nThe caller reported that the person with the gun was `` probably a juvenile '' and that the weapon was `` probably a fake , '' but that information was not provided to Loehmann and another officer , Frank Garmback , who went to the park .\nLoehmann fired two shots less than two seconds after opening the car door .\nLoehmann , according to a statement the Justice Department released in December 2020 , `` repeatedly and consistently '' said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handgun .\nBoth officers testified they had given Tamir `` multiple commands to show his hands before shooting . ''\nThere was a video of the shooting recorded by a surveillance camera at the recreation center , but the time-lapse footage was grainy and had no audio .\nDOJ noted that because of the angle of the camera , Tamir \u2019 s hands weren \u2019 t visible and it wasn \u2019 t clear what he was doing right before Loehmann fired his gun .\nIn late 2015 , a grand jury in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two officers .\nIn October 2020 , the New York Times reported that DOJ officials had decided more than a year earlier to end the federal probe without pressing charges , but hadn \u2019 t yet taken the \u201c bureaucratic steps \u201d to make that official and hadn \u2019 t notified Rice \u2019 s family or the public .\nThe Times also reported that prosecutors had asked for permission to use a grand jury in the investigation , and that request had been denied .\nFollowing the December 2020 announcement and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Tamir Rice \u2019 s family wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland and other officials last spring urging them to reopen the investigation ; they had support from Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and three members of the state \u2019 s congressional delegation .\nSamaria Rice and Jonathan Abady , an attorney working with the family , met with Clarke on Oct. 27 .\nAbady also submitted a letter dated Jan. 3 signed by dozens of legal scholars explaining why they believed the actions of the Cleveland police officers involved in Tamir Rice \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a federal civil rights charge and why prosecutors should convene a federal grand jury .\nClarke acknowledged the October meeting and the letters , and wrote in response that , \u201c After thorough consideration of this information and the available evidence , the Justice Department \u2019 s career prosecutors have concluded that this information does not change its earlier 2020 decision.\n\u201d The Justice Department under Biden has promoted civil rights as a top priority and poured more resources into Clarke \u2019 s division .\nThe Cleveland Police Department has been subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department since 2015 that requires a series of reforms , after a DOJ report in late 2014 found the department had a `` pattern or practice '' of using excessive force .\nLast spring , Garland made back-to-back announcements of investigations into policing practices in Minneapolis and St. Louis .\nClarke concluded her letter to Abady , \u201c Please know that we remain committed to doing all that we can to promote policing accountability and reform.\n\u201d A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment .\nSamaria Rice said she would continue to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son \u2019 s case .\nShe was dismissive of Clarke \u2019 s pledge for reforms absent federal action against Loehmann .\n\u201c Shame on them , \u201d she said .",

        "content": "So when two women showed up at the National Butterfly Center last Friday asking to see \u201c the illegals crossing on rafts , \u201d Trevi\u00f1o-Wright said , her son at the front desk quickly knew what was going on .\nThe women identified themselves as Kimberly Lowe , who is running for Congress in Virginia , and a person whom Kimberly referred to as \u201c Michelle , \u201d and identified herself as a Secret Service agent in an audio recording , but whose identity BuzzFeed News could not verify .\nAccording to an affidavit that he later prepared for police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the women that they needed to pay an admission fee to enter the property .\nMichelle , he wrote , told him that she was with the Secret Service and that both women had big sway in Washington , DC , and they wanted to see \u201c the immigrants crossing on the rafts.\n\u201d Trevi\u00f1o-Wright said her son came to get her and that she googled Lowe before approaching the women .\nShe provided BuzzFeed News with an audio recording of her interaction with Lowe and Michelle , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted of the incident as it took place , which has since been deleted .\nIn the audio recording , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright quickly tells the women their \u201c agenda is not welcome here \u201d and asks them to leave .\n\u201c So you \u2019 re not for keeping the illegals out ?\n\u201d Michelle counters .\nLowe jumps in as well : \u201c So you \u2019 re not for helping all these poor people in the humanitarian crisis ?\nYou \u2019 re OK with children being sex trafficked and raped and murdered ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lowe agrees , but not before adding , \u201c I 'm sorry that you 're okay with children being raped and murdered.\n\u201d From there , things appear to devolve .\nMichelle again insists she \u2019 s with the Secret Service and they leave the building .\nOutside , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright says , Lowe started trying to record her .\nTrevi\u00f1o-Wright told BuzzFeed News she \u2019 s had her photo posted online by right-wing trolls and faced threats of doxxing , so she really didn \u2019 t want Lowe to record her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone .\nLowe says she took the phone .\nThen , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright says Michelle pushed her to the ground .\nLowe says Trevi\u00f1o-Wright fell .\nEither way , Trevi\u00f1o-Wright ended up on the ground and Michelle clearly says on the audio , \u201c Stay the fuck down , bitch.\n\u201d Lowe then made a run for her car where she started up the now-deleted Facebook Live video and started screaming for Michelle to get in the car with her .\nOnce Michelle is inside the car , she points out that Nicholas is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn the video , the camera is pointed at Lowe as she hits the gas and the engine revs .\nMichelle yells , \u201c Whoa whoa whoa , KC !\n\u201d Lowe looks forward shouting , \u201c Get the fuck out of my way .\nGet out of my fucking way .\nGet the fuck out of my way .\nJesus Christ.\n\u201d Nicholas wrote in his affidavit to police that he had to jump out of the way of the car to avoid being hit .\nHe wrote that he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women from leaving before police arrived and because he believed they had his mother \u2019 s phone .\nLowe denied that she tried to hit Nicholas and accused the Wrights of assault and \u201c kidnapping \u201d for trying to prevent them from leaving and attempting to close the gate .\nLowe also sent BuzzFeed News a copy of her Facebook Live video , but a version that cuts off before she speeds up the car toward the gate .\nShe said she took it down because of \u201c an investigation.\n\u201d \u201d I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son to hit him period , \u201d Lowe wrote in a text to BuzzFeed News , adding that she had her children with her .\n\u201c I was trying to escape to safety with my children and did not attempt to hit him !\n!\n\u201d Asked why she went to the butterfly center in the first place and accused Trevi\u00f1o-Wright of allowing sex trafficking , Lowe said via text , \u201c Someone suggested I walk to the river to see what may be happening .\nI came to TX to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she is planning to join a \u201c private border tour \u201d this weekend featuring Michael Flynn , Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser and one of the biggest proponents of 2020 election conspiracy theories , as part of the pro-Trump events near the butterfly center .\nBut Lowe emphasized that the event was not the reason for her trip .\nLowe repeatedly said that Trevi\u00f1o-Wright 's story was a \u201c politically motivated attack \u201d against her .\nAnd she did not answer when asked multiple times whether Michelle has any affiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last name .\n\u201c I 'm a good person with a big heart putting myself out there to truly help people \u2014 I do n't deserve this mess from her , \u201d she said in a text .\nBoth women said that they spoke to Mission , Texas , police about the incident .\nLowe said in a text that she was \u201c cleared \u201d by police , but the police department did not respond to a request for comment on whether the case is still open or for copies of police reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witness .\nBob Axford , a Canadian man who said he is snowbirding in Texas for the winter , was standing in the parking lot as the scene played out and confirmed many of the details provided by Trevi\u00f1o-Wright and her son .\nAxford told BuzzFeed News he did not know any of the people involved in the altercation and had never been to the National Butterfly Center before Friday ; he \u2019 d just dropped by to confirm its location and grab a map of the property ahead of a planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the women as they talked with Trevi\u00f1o-Wright 's son , he said , and overheard that one of them was named Lowe and was running for Congress .\nOnce he got Nicholas \u2019 s attention and got a map , Axford said he went to sit in his truck for a few minutes and take a look at it .\n\u201c Then I saw a couple minutes later , four people kinda tumble out the door and be at each others \u2019 throats.\n\u201d He saw one of them fall down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that he was too far away to see how she fell .\nHe called 911 .\nThen he saw Lowe get into her car and back it up closer to the others .\nOnce Michelle got into the car with her , he said , \u201c she went full blast \u2026 and almost directly at me .\nI almost got hit there .\nBut I was in a bigger truck than they were , \u201d he said .\nThe car then headed for the gate and Trevi\u00f1o-Wright 's son at speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas \u201c probably did \u201d have to jump out of the way to avoid being hit .\n\u201c It just looked like a commercial , \u201d he said .\nAxford said he spoke to police about the altercation and repeatedly called Lowe \u2019 s driving \u201c completely reckless.\n\u201d \u201c This person should not be an elected official in any way , shape , or form , \u201d he said .\nOn Friday night , after this story published , Lowe told BuzzFeed News that she was turned away from the border tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her trip to the butterfly center , saying that she was being \u201c cancelled by the right.\n\u201d Lowe said that Christina Hutcherson , the founder of Women Fighting for America , and Arizona state Rep. Mark Finchem , another major proponent of election conspiracy theories , refused to let her on the bus Friday night and told her that she had endangered their event .\nNeither Finchem nor Hutcherson immediately responded to a request for comment .\nLowe said she had driven all the way from Virginia to spend two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on Friday night , she said she was able to get out of her hotel booking and was on the road , driving back home .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden on Thursday repeated his pledge to nominate the first Black woman for the US Supreme Court now that Justice Stephen Breyer plans to step down .\nIt \u2019 s a move that underscores not only the historic lack of diversity on the high court , but also just how much women and people of color , and especially women of color , have been dramatically underrepresented in the federal judiciary \u2019 s 232-year history .\nThe lack of racial and gender diversity on the bench is often most noticeable when it comes to the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justices who have served compared to the rest of the court system and their much higher public profile .\nJust three of the 115 justices have been Black or Latinx : the late justice and pioneering civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall , and sitting Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor .\nBut the numbers aren \u2019 t much better in the lower courts , where 1.8 % of federal judges to have ever served have been Black women \u2014 70 out of 3,840 \u2014 and 3.4 % have been women of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public database .\nRepresentation has improved in the past few decades but continues to lag .\nBlack women make up approximately 7.4 % of the US population , according to BuzzFeed News \u2019 analysis of census data .\nThere are 1,395 sitting federal judges , a number that includes judges who are fully active as well as judges in a type of quasi-retirement known as senior status who have the option of smaller caseloads .\nOf the current cohort , 56 judges are Black women \u2014 making up 4 % of the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being multiracial \u2014 and a total of 114 are women of color , making up just over 8 % .\nJudges who identify solely as white make up 78.5 % of the federal bench , compared to 61.6 % of the total US population , according to the 2020 Census .\nOn the federal appeals courts , representation of women of color has gone up by just a few percentage points as well .\nOf the 809 appellate judges to have ever served , 13 have been Black women \u2014 making up 1.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been women of color , making up 2.9 % .\nOut of 293 federal appeals court judges serving today , 10 are Black women , making up 3.4 % , out of 20 women of color , coming to 6.8 % .\n\u201c You have a situation where our highest courts do not at all reflect our communities , the diversity of our communities , and particularly so when it comes to Black women , \u201d said Juvaria Khan , the founder of the Appellate Project , an initiative launched in 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing in the appeals courts with an eye to creating more pipelines to judgeships .\nJudges of color have long talked about how having courts reflect the communities they serve builds public trust and deepens the wealth of expertise they can draw on in making decisions .\nAt a panel discussion last year , 6th Circuit Judge Bernice Donald , one of the few Black women on the federal appellate bench , explained : \u201c We as judges will always follow the law but ... justice is informed by our perspectives .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are driven by our life experiences ; rather , they add different angles from which to look at an issue or question . ''\nUS District Judge Carlton Reeves , who sits in Jackson , Mississippi , said at the same event that the judiciary faced a \u201c crisis of legitimacy \u201d if it failed to catch up to the demographics of the country .\nThere are three judges widely considered to be frontrunners for Justice Stephen Breyer \u2019 s seat ; he \u2019 s disclosed that he intends to step down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term this summer , assuming a successor is confirmed .\nTwo of those judges are on the federal bench : Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and US District Judge J. Michelle Childs of South Carolina ; the third is a member of California \u2019 s state supreme court , Judge Leondra Kruger .\nThe lower federal courts and state courts aren \u2019 t the only places where presidents can pull Supreme Court nominees from \u2014 Justice Elena Kagan , a former US solicitor general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and technically by law justices don \u2019 t even have to be lawyers \u2014 but it \u2019 s by far the most common path to the highest court in the modern era .\nKhan said that although many more BIPOC students are entering law school than in the past , that hasn \u2019 t automatically increased their representation among federal court nominees , especially at the appellate level .\nShe identified a few reasons for that , including that the path to the bench \u2014 which often involves prestigious clerkships , key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve appeals court practice \u2014 isn \u2019 t always clear , particularly for students who may be the first in their families to reach that level of education .\n\u201c What you get is a lot of very highly qualified law students , especially students of color , who are outside of that network , \u201d Khan said .\nThe first Black woman was confirmed to a federal judgeship in 1966 : Judge Constance Baker Motley .\nAfter earning her law degree from Columbia Law School in 1946 , Motley spent the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund ; she was hired by Marshall .\nHer work featured a string of landmark desegregation cases , including Brown v. Board of Education .\nThe year before her nomination to the federal district court in Manhattan by former president Lyndon Johnson , she became the first Black woman elected to serve in the New York state senate .\nUnder former president Donald Trump , the majority of federal court nominees were white men .\nThe Biden administration has prioritized not only gender and racial diversity but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighting nominees who worked as public defenders and in other areas of law , including civil rights .\nIn his first year in office , he tapped a series of nominees who represented more historic firsts in terms of diversity across the federal judiciary .\nMore than half of the 42 judges confirmed since Biden took office have been women of color .\nSome of those barrier-breaking nominees have already been confirmed , including US District Judge Zahid Qureshi of New Jersey , the first Muslim American to serve as a presidentially appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson , the first openly lesbian woman to serve on any federal appeals court ; and Federal Circuit Judge Tiffany Cunningham , the first Black judge on that court .",

        "content": "Last month I had strep throat\u2013level pain while living with two people who were confirmed COVID positive .\nYet , several rapid tests kept telling me I was COVID-free .\nIt \u2019 s a confusing experience shared by many as the highly transmissible Omicron variant continues to spread in the US .\nAt the same time , millions more at-home rapid tests are becoming available .\n( And by available , I mean there are more of them , but you can \u2019 t always find them at your local store .\nYou can order free rapid tests from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still the gold standard , they can take a few days to a week or more to produce results as understaffed labs struggle to keep up with demand .\nRapid tests are a welcome addition because they can give results in minutes .\nBut beware of the dreaded false negative .\nIt happened to Georgia resident and economist Christopher Cunningham , 46 , whose 16-year-old daughter had a positive result on a PCR test on Jan. 7 and again 10 days later .\nHer rapid tests , however , always came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 9-year-old daughter .\n( Both were vaccinated . )\nBut just because your rapid test takes a while to turn positive \u2060\u2014 or doesn \u2019 t at all \u2060\u2014 it doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re free of infection or that your test is a fraud .\nIt could happen because you were vaccinated , you missed the window when it would \u2019 ve turned positive , you collected your test sample incorrectly , or you need to test again in a few days , according to Dr. Emily Landon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine .\n( Keep in mind your symptoms could have a non-COVID cause , too \u2014 the flu is circulating . )\nHere \u2019 s how rapid tests work and why you can get false negative results when you have COVID , particularly in the early stages of infection .\nRapid COVID tests , also called antigen tests , work by detecting bits of proteins on the surface of the coronavirus .\nThey only appear positive when your body has a certain amount of virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not detect COVID cases that don \u2019 t reach that threshold .\nAnd most importantly , Landon noted , rapid tests can be negative early in your infection even if you \u2019 re feeling symptoms because it may take a while before there \u2019 s enough virus for the test to pick up .\n( Your vaccination status can influence this process , too , but more on that later . )\nThis relatively high threshold correlates with contagiousness , experts say .\nIf your rapid test is positive , you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , Landon said .\nIf it \u2019 s negative later on in the course of your infection , after symptoms resolve , you \u2019 re likely no longer infectious .\n\u201c Rapid tests are definitely not like a pregnancy test where it 's going to be positive as long as it 's been a few weeks after someone missed a period , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It 's only going to pick it up when you 're at peak infectiousness , and they \u2019 re almost never false positive.\n\u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm a positive rapid test result with a PCR test , Landon added .\n( The FDA and CDC agree . )\n\u201c Rapid tests are really reliable , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c You do n't need to swear at the company and say , \u2018 There 's no way I could have COVID \u2019 ; you definitely have COVID .\nYou need to stay home.\n\u201d There \u2019 s a relatively small window when a rapid test will be positive You can think of your viral load like a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of medicine and pathology and laboratory medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School .\n\u201c It kind of goes up sharply to a peak and then it starts to decline eventually down to zero.\n\u201d However , the window of peak viral load when rapid tests will appear positive can be relatively short , Landon said , and some people are going to miss it entirely , which could explain my and many others \u2019 experience .\nThe window varies widely , too ; it could last three days , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for some people because everyone clears the virus from their system at their own pace , she said .\nIn what seems like another layer of complexity , the intensity of that second line on your rapid test is likely an indicator of infectiousness , experts say .\nThe darker it is ( and the quicker it appears within the 15-minute wait period ) , the higher your viral load and risk of spreading the virus , and vice versa .\nYou should take more than one rapid test If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid test , Landon suggests you confirm that result with a PCR test or take another rapid within the next two days .\nWhile rapid tests are specific and are unlikely to generate a false positive , they aren \u2019 t that sensitive , meaning they are more likely to generate a false negative than some other tests .\nOn the other hand , PCR tests are much more sensitive .\nThey look for the tiniest fragments of coronavirus genetic material by multiplying the virus over a million times until it becomes detectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means PCR tests could be positive even though you \u2019 re no longer contagious because they can pick up on really low viral loads .\nThese tiny viral remains could also be zombies : pieces of dead virus that can \u2019 t make you or others sick .\nThe takeaway : Don \u2019 t be surprised if your PCR test stays positive for weeks or months after initial infection .\nIt \u2019 s normal and common .\nThe CDC says you can end isolation after five days if you have not had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are resolving .\nAfter that , they suggest caution for an additional five days , including mask-wearing , avoiding travel , and staying away from people who are at high risk .\nYou do n't need to have a negative result to end isolation , but if you do want to take a rapid antigen test , they suggest testing near the end of the five-day period when you have been fever-free for 24 hours ( without taking fever-reducing medicine ) .\nIf it 's still positive , you should isolate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important things you should remember about rapid COVID tests is that they aren \u2019 t influenced by symptoms \u2014 they only turn positive if your nasal swab has enough virus it can detect .\nWhile logically you might think more virus equals more symptoms , that \u2019 s not always the case .\nYour runny nose and muscle aches are just your body \u2019 s reactions to it fighting the coronavirus off , and that reaction varies depending on if you \u2019 ve encountered the germ before , either from an infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after symptoms appear for your body to produce a viral load that \u2019 s to the rapid test \u2019 s liking .\nHaving symptoms can be a bonus , however , because they can help you decide when to take your rapid test to ensure you get the most accurate results possible .\n\u201c People who are asymptomatic pretty much have the same rise and fall in viral load as people who are symptomatic , \u201d Blaser said .\n\u201c So , you do n't really know where you are in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic , you can still spread the coronavirus even if you \u2019 re symptom-free .\nThis means rapid tests are also helpful tools for asymptomatic people , though it \u2019 s harder to tell when to take a test without symptoms to guide you , Landon said .\nMoreover , time isn \u2019 t on your side , Landon admitted .\nRapid test results can change quickly as your viral load rises and drops , often within hours , so if you don \u2019 t have COVID symptoms , taking a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is much better than using it the day or morning before because in 12 hours that test could read positive.\n\u201d It \u2019 s unclear how viral load differs between symptomatic and asymptomatic people infected with the Omicron variant , but many early studies found it was comparable among the groups .",

        "content": "A nonsurgical N95 respirator is a mask designed to fit snugly around your nose and mouth with straps that go around your head ; it \u2019 s made of layered polypropylene , or plastic , fibers that effectively filter out 95 % of any bacteria or virus particles you or others breathe , cough , or sneeze out \u2014 if worn properly and consistently .\nThe material uses the power of static electricity to catch incoming germs or particles as air passes through the tiny spaces between the fibers .\nN95s are called \u201c respirators \u201d because they filter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like surgical masks , aren \u2019 t \u201c respirators \u201d because they can \u2019 t effectively filter the air you breathe ; they mostly help block large respiratory droplets that may carry germs from entering your mouth , like a snotty sneeze or phlegmy cough .\nThere are several different types and shapes of N95s ; some look like duck bills , others like domes , and several have three panels .\nThe main difference between nonsurgical and surgical N95s is that the latter are also fluid resistant to protect doctors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprays , Dr. David Banach , an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at UConn Health of the University of Connecticut , told BuzzFeed News .\nThe government is sending nonsurgical N95 respirators to the public because those are the masks that are available in the Strategic National Stockpile , the HHS spokesperson told us .\nBut there are similarly effective respirators , such as KN95s commonly sold at stores like Home Depot , that you could use as well .\nN95 respirators are regulated by the US with standards set by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIOSH ) , while KN95s ( and KF94s and others ) follow international standards , meaning they also should screen out about 95 % of germs and particles , but their effectiveness can vary between brands sold in the US .\nThat \u2019 s why Banach advises extra caution if you choose to wear these masks .\nThe CDC found that about 60 % of KN95s tested in 2020 and 2021 were less effective than advertised .\nThat said , many of the KN95s had a filter efficiency of 90 % or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtration efficiencies as low as 10 % to 20 % .\nBoth KN95s and KF94s offer the virus-catching electrostatic charge , so they should offer strong protection for you and others around you .\nLegitimate N95s are approved by the CDC \u2019 s NIOSH and will have specific markings , including the NIOSH logo or block letters on them to indicate their authenticity .\nKeep in mind that KN95s are not approved by NIOSH , so any claims to that effect suggests they are counterfeits .\nOther signs of counterfeit N95 respirators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes around your head , no markings on the filtering facepiece , and a missing or misspelled NIOSH mark .\nHere are some pictures of counterfeit respirators from the CDC and a full list of companies that make NIOSH-approved face respirators that are similarly or more protective than N95s .\nThe biggest complaint people make about N95s is that they can be hard to wear , particularly in hot conditions or when you have to exert yourself .\n( N95s with exhalation valves can help improve breathability , but experts strongly recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t filter the air you exhale \u2014 so they protect you , but not the people around you if you have COVID . )\nAlthough it may take a bit more effort to breathe through N95s , NIOSH tests have shown some of the respirators have better overall breathability than cloth or surgical masks , Karan of Stanford said , so it could take some time before you find the right type for you .\nOn the more comfortable side are the loose-fitting and disposable surgical masks , which can offer high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly ( secured over your mouth , nose , and chin with minimal gaps ) .\nThey are made of the same electrostatic material as N95s , but surgical masks don \u2019 t have the same fit or filters as their higher-quality counterparts .\nCloth masks could be anything from a scrap of T-shirt attached to two ear loops to a bandana .\nThe CDC and other experts say these options offer the least protection against the coronavirus , though there are ways to lock in more protection , like layering it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N95 \u2019 s protection compare to other masks ?\nIn its updated guidance , the CDC says well-fitting N95 respirators give the best protection for yourself and others , followed by KN95s and surgical masks , then cloth masks .\nN95s and KN95s are about 90\u201395 % or more protective against virus particles ( but remember it could vary with KN95s ) , while surgical masks stand in the 50\u201360 % range , Karan said .\nIf you layer them with a cloth mask , you can reach between 70\u201375 % protection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little as 20-40 % effective , he added .",

''\nCommonly used products in `` slugging '' are Aquaphor , Vaseline , or Cerave 's Healing Ointment .\nThe best part of this hack ?\nEvery item listed is less than $ 10 .",

        "content": "Last month I had strep throat\u2013level pain while living with two people who were confirmed COVID positive .\nYet , several rapid tests kept telling me I was COVID-free .\nIt \u2019 s a confusing experience shared by many as the highly transmissible Omicron variant continues to spread in the US .\nAt the same time , millions more at-home rapid tests are becoming available .\n( And by available , I mean there are more of them , but you can \u2019 t always find them at your local store .\nYou can order free rapid tests from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still the gold standard , they can take a few days to a week or more to produce results as understaffed labs struggle to keep up with demand .\nRapid tests are a welcome addition because they can give results in minutes .\nBut beware of the dreaded false negative .\nIt happened to Georgia resident and economist Christopher Cunningham , 46 , whose 16-year-old daughter had a positive result on a PCR test on Jan. 7 and again 10 days later .\nHer rapid tests , however , always came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 9-year-old daughter .\n( Both were vaccinated . )\nBut just because your rapid test takes a while to turn positive \u2060\u2014 or doesn \u2019 t at all \u2060\u2014 it doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re free of infection or that your test is a fraud .\nIt could happen because you were vaccinated , you missed the window when it would \u2019 ve turned positive , you collected your test sample incorrectly , or you need to test again in a few days , according to Dr. Emily Landon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine .\n( Keep in mind your symptoms could have a non-COVID cause , too \u2014 the flu is circulating . )\nHere \u2019 s how rapid tests work and why you can get false negative results when you have COVID , particularly in the early stages of infection .\nRapid COVID tests , also called antigen tests , work by detecting bits of proteins on the surface of the coronavirus .\nThey only appear positive when your body has a certain amount of virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not detect COVID cases that don \u2019 t reach that threshold .\nAnd most importantly , Landon noted , rapid tests can be negative early in your infection even if you \u2019 re feeling symptoms because it may take a while before there \u2019 s enough virus for the test to pick up .\n( Your vaccination status can influence this process , too , but more on that later . )\nThis relatively high threshold correlates with contagiousness , experts say .\nIf your rapid test is positive , you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , Landon said .\nIf it \u2019 s negative later on in the course of your infection , after symptoms resolve , you \u2019 re likely no longer infectious .\n\u201c Rapid tests are definitely not like a pregnancy test where it 's going to be positive as long as it 's been a few weeks after someone missed a period , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It 's only going to pick it up when you 're at peak infectiousness , and they \u2019 re almost never false positive.\n\u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm a positive rapid test result with a PCR test , Landon added .\n( The FDA and CDC agree . )\n\u201c Rapid tests are really reliable , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c You do n't need to swear at the company and say , \u2018 There 's no way I could have COVID \u2019 ; you definitely have COVID .\nYou need to stay home.\n\u201d There \u2019 s a relatively small window when a rapid test will be positive You can think of your viral load like a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of medicine and pathology and laboratory medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School .\n\u201c It kind of goes up sharply to a peak and then it starts to decline eventually down to zero.\n\u201d However , the window of peak viral load when rapid tests will appear positive can be relatively short , Landon said , and some people are going to miss it entirely , which could explain my and many others \u2019 experience .\nThe window varies widely , too ; it could last three days , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for some people because everyone clears the virus from their system at their own pace , she said .\nIn what seems like another layer of complexity , the intensity of that second line on your rapid test is likely an indicator of infectiousness , experts say .\nThe darker it is ( and the quicker it appears within the 15-minute wait period ) , the higher your viral load and risk of spreading the virus , and vice versa .\nYou should take more than one rapid test If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid test , Landon suggests you confirm that result with a PCR test or take another rapid within the next two days .\nWhile rapid tests are specific and are unlikely to generate a false positive , they aren \u2019 t that sensitive , meaning they are more likely to generate a false negative than some other tests .\nOn the other hand , PCR tests are much more sensitive .\nThey look for the tiniest fragments of coronavirus genetic material by multiplying the virus over a million times until it becomes detectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means PCR tests could be positive even though you \u2019 re no longer contagious because they can pick up on really low viral loads .\nThese tiny viral remains could also be zombies : pieces of dead virus that can \u2019 t make you or others sick .\nThe takeaway : Don \u2019 t be surprised if your PCR test stays positive for weeks or months after initial infection .\nIt \u2019 s normal and common .\nThe CDC says you can end isolation after five days if you have not had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are resolving .\nAfter that , they suggest caution for an additional five days , including mask-wearing , avoiding travel , and staying away from people who are at high risk .\nYou do n't need to have a negative result to end isolation , but if you do want to take a rapid antigen test , they suggest testing near the end of the five-day period when you have been fever-free for 24 hours ( without taking fever-reducing medicine ) .\nIf it 's still positive , you should isolate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important things you should remember about rapid COVID tests is that they aren \u2019 t influenced by symptoms \u2014 they only turn positive if your nasal swab has enough virus it can detect .\nWhile logically you might think more virus equals more symptoms , that \u2019 s not always the case .\nYour runny nose and muscle aches are just your body \u2019 s reactions to it fighting the coronavirus off , and that reaction varies depending on if you \u2019 ve encountered the germ before , either from an infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after symptoms appear for your body to produce a viral load that \u2019 s to the rapid test \u2019 s liking .\nHaving symptoms can be a bonus , however , because they can help you decide when to take your rapid test to ensure you get the most accurate results possible .\n\u201c People who are asymptomatic pretty much have the same rise and fall in viral load as people who are symptomatic , \u201d Blaser said .\n\u201c So , you do n't really know where you are in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic , you can still spread the coronavirus even if you \u2019 re symptom-free .\nThis means rapid tests are also helpful tools for asymptomatic people , though it \u2019 s harder to tell when to take a test without symptoms to guide you , Landon said .\nMoreover , time isn \u2019 t on your side , Landon admitted .\nRapid test results can change quickly as your viral load rises and drops , often within hours , so if you don \u2019 t have COVID symptoms , taking a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is much better than using it the day or morning before because in 12 hours that test could read positive.\n\u201d It \u2019 s unclear how viral load differs between symptomatic and asymptomatic people infected with the Omicron variant , but many early studies found it was comparable among the groups .",

        "content": "The federal criminal statute at issue , 18 USC 1512 ( c ) ( 2 ) , states that a person who \u201c corruptly \u2026 obstructs , influences , or impedes any official proceeding , or attempts to do so \u201d can face up to 20 years in prison .\nCongress adopted the language as part of a package of reforms in the aftermath of corporate scandals in the early 2000s , including the collapse of energy giant Enron and revelations about how key players tried to destroy documents and evade investigation .\nDefendants charged in the Capitol attack have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifies as an \u201c official proceeding \u201d and argued that Congress \u2019 joint session on Jan. 6 , 2021 , to certify the Electoral College results shouldn \u2019 t count .\nThey \u2019 ve also argued that their alleged actions at the Capitol weren \u2019 t the type of obstructive conduct that the law was meant to cover , and that the word \u201c corruptly \u201d is so vague that it \u2019 s unconstitutional .\nSome defendants have argued that an \u201c official proceeding \u201d should be related to the administration of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness testimony .\nMcHugh had argued that it had to be \u201c adjudicative , \u201d similar to a court hearing , and that the Jan. 6 certification session didn \u2019 t fit the criteria because it was a \u201c ceremonial and administrative event.\n\u201d Not so , Bates found .\n\u201c It was a formal assembly of the Congress for the purpose of conducting official business , and it involved an entity other than Congress \u2014 the Electoral College \u2014 as an integral component , \u201d Bates wrote .\n\u201c McHugh \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often paired the obstruction count with separate charges that a defendant committed other serious crimes at the Capitol , such as assaulting police or conspiracy .\nThey \u2019 ve also charged it in cases where they contend the evidence is more robust about a person \u2019 s intent to disrupt Congress , or that their presence played a more direct role in halting the joint session .\nIt \u2019 s cropped up in cases where defendants are accused of verbally confronting police or joining a crowd that pushed against law enforcement .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendants are accused of making their way into the Senate chamber \u2014 like the case of Paul Hodgkins , sentenced to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to obstruction \u2014 or explicitly searching for lawmakers .\nThe government has also pursued the charge in some , but not all , cases where defendants allegedly spoke publicly or posted online about the reasons they went into the Capitol .\nOne high-profile example was the case of Jenny Cudd , who livestreamed from outside her hotel that evening and described how she and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the Capitol after learning former vice president Mike Pence had \u201c betrayed us \u201d and would not seek to overturn the election .\nShe took a deal to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge \u2014 prosecutors have extended similar offers to a handful of defendants indicted for obstruction but no other felonies \u2014 and is scheduled for sentencing in March .\nThe first big decision on the lawfulness of the obstruction charge in these cases came on Dec. 10 , when US District Judge Dabney Friedrich denied a challenge raised by defendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and DeGrave are also charged with conspiracy \u2014 prosecutors allege they planned for a violent attack on the Capitol and traveled with a cache of weapons \u2014 as well as other felony counts for assaulting and interfering with police officers inside the Capitol .\nIn successfully arguing to keep Sandlin and DeGrave in jail while their cases go forward , prosecutors submitted videos that they said showed the two men fighting with officers trying to stop rioters from going through a door to the Senate gallery .\nSandlin and DeGrave \u2019 s challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points .\nFirst , when Congress gathered for a special session to certify the results of the Electoral College , it wasn \u2019 t the type of \u201c official proceeding \u201d the law was meant to cover .\nSecond , even if it were an \u201c official proceeding , \u201d their alleged actions that day didn \u2019 t \u201c obstruct , influence , and impede.\n\u201d Finally , DeGrave argued the term \u201c corruptly \u201d was too vague , which meant it was unconstitutional .\nFriedrich rejected their interpretation of \u201c official proceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve witnesses or evidence \u2014 although she noted that not every single action that Congress took would qualify .\nIt had to be \u201c akin to a formal hearing , \u201d and that was true of the Jan. 6 joint session , the judge concluded .\n\u201c There is a presiding officer , a process by which objections can be heard , debated , and ruled upon , and a decision \u2014 the certification of the results \u2014 that must be reached before the session can be adjourned , \u201d Friedrich wrote .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Congress \u2019 response to the Enron scandal didn \u2019 t stop courts from applying the text to other types of situations , the judge found .\nShe wrote : \u201c That Congress acted due to concerns about document destruction and the integrity of investigations of corporate criminality does not define the statute \u2019 s scope.\n\u201d The word \u201c otherwise \u201d opened the door to a range of potential criminal activity that could \u201c obstruct \u201d an official proceeding , she wrote , including the allegations that Sandlin and DeGrave tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote \u201c by engaging in disruptive conduct , including by assaulting law enforcement in the Capitol.\n\u201d The challenge to the word \u201c corruptly \u201d failed for the same reason , Friedrich found .\nQuoting from an unrelated , earlier case , she wrote that \u201c independently criminal \u201d conduct would come under the umbrella of \u201c corruptly.\n\u201d The allegations that Sandlin and DeGrave plotted in advance , breached the Capitol to stop the vote certification , assaulted police officers , and encouraged people to steal items from the Senate \u201c fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , \u201d she wrote .\nJust over a week after the ruling in Sandlin and DeGrave \u2019 s case , US District Judge Amit Mehta on Dec. 20 released an opinion in arguably the most significant and highest-profile prosecution effort to date : the conspiracy case against people allegedly affiliated with the Oath Keepers .\nIn a footnote , Mehta pointed out that Friedrich rejected many of the same arguments raised in the Oath Keepers case , and that although he wasn \u2019 t going to explicitly cite her opinion , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Friedrich \u2019 s holdings and finds her reasoning for those holdings to be persuasive.\n\u201d The original Oath Keepers case split into three separate prosecutions last month , including the bombshell seditious conspiracy case that added Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes into the mix .\nMehta recently made clear that his rulings in the original conspiracy case would carry over , heading off any attempt to relitigate the obstruction charge .\nThe opinions that followed Friedrich \u2019 s initial ruling quoted from and built on one another .\nThe day after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Boasberg refused to dismiss the obstruction count against Aaron Mostofsky , a New York man whose presence in the Capitol went viral because of his fur-laden outfit and his status as the son of a judge .\nProsecutors previously offered a deal that would require Mostofsky to plead guilty to the obstruction count , which he didn \u2019 t take .\nThey later dropped the offer down to a felony that

in a conspiracy case brought against a set of leaders from the Proud Boys extremist group and in a case against two men accused of making their way to the Senate gallery and confronting police officers both inside and outside the building .\nFriedrich weighed in again on Dec. 29 , rebuffing arguments raised by Guy Reffitt , a Texas man accused of bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds .\nReffitt allegedly tried to go up a set of steps leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police .\nHe is set to be the first Jan. 6 defendant to go to trial later this month .\nMore rulings upholding the lawfulness of the obstruction charge have come in over the past month , with some judges announcing their decisions from the bench in lieu of a formal written opinion like the one that Bates released in McHugh \u2019 s case this week .\nOther defendants who recently lost challenges include Jerod Hughes , who prosecutors say was part of the mob that chased US Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman @

Mike Lee pushed back against FTC officials Tuesday at a Consumer Protection subcommittee hearing , calling their previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers illegal , and warning that honest businesses could be targeted .\nLee said it would be \u201c legislative malpractice \u201d to give the FTC back these powers without significant restrictions .\n\u201c It \u2019 s also essential that consumers continue to have access to goods and services provided by legitimate businesses , \u201d Lee said .\nLevine responded that the FTC would not have complete freedom to compel fines on its own , but would have to convince a federal judge .\n\u201c Frankly , Senator , these are not close calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraudsters , who are selling people snake oil , \u201d he said .\nLee responded that the FTC has \u201c overwhelming power \u201d and \u201c it \u2019 s not an even playing field \u201d for businesses defending themselves in court .\nLee did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about what protections for business he wants included in the law .\nSen. Marsha Blackburn , the ranking Republican on the Consumer Protection subcommittee , also refused requests for comment .\nDuring the hearing , both parties criticized the FTC for doing too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price gouging during the pandemic .\nThe agency has only brought forward a handful of cases under the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act Congress passed last year .\nSamuel Levine said that earlier in the pandemic the agency focused on sending cease-and-desist notices when it saw fraudulent products being advertised to consumers .\nHe said the FTC frequently got those ads down within 48 hours , preventing further time .\nBut Levine said the priority is now shifting towards leveling criminal penalties to send a message to scammers .\n\u201c We \u2019 re now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t only want to get these claims taken down .\nWe want to make sure scammers out there know they \u2019 re going to pay a heavy price , not only pay back what they stole but pay a penalty to the government as punishment , \u201d he said .\nHe also said that the FTC will continue to be restricted in its response as long as it lacks its former Section 13 ( b ) powers .\nThere are no signs that will happen anytime soon , despite sky-high reports of COVID-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sen. Blumenthal that his bill does not seem to be a live issue in Congress , he did not disagree but said \u201c things have a way of changing around here .\n\u201d",

Steve Scalise .\nAs Times attorney David Axelrod told the jury , the newspaper amended the two incorrect sentences of the 12-paragraph piece and issued a prominent correction roughly 12 hours after it was published .\nHe said James Bennet , the editor in charge of the opinion section at the time , never meant to convey that Palin was responsible for the shooting and had barely slept that night as he agonized over the error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Times made a regrettable error , \u201d Axelrod said in opening statements .\nBut he also argued that Palin had not suffered any harm as a result of the editorial , stating that she went on to be paid for speeches and even appeared in 2020 as a contestant on The Masked Singer .",

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nWe put our lips through a lot .\nEating , drinking , kissing , licking , and exposure to the elements ( unless you \u2019 re wearing a mask outdoors , that is ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips are up against , so it \u2019 s no surprise that they \u2019 re often dry , cracked , and just angry in general .\nDuring winter months in particular , the cold wind and lack of humidity can cause extra dryness and discomfort .\n\u201c More water evaporates from the skin with hot showers and heaters , \u201d said Dr. Caren Campbell , a board-certified dermatologist with boutique clinics in Napa and San Francisco .\n\u201c Then we lick our lips , which causes even more water evaporation.\n\u201d While these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our lips are far more susceptible to drying out than most other parts of the body .\n\u201c It 's pretty thin skin compared to other places on your face and it \u2019 s also much , much , much more vascular , \u201d said Dr. Morgan Rabach , a dermatologist at LM Medical NYC .\n\u201c There are so many more blood vessels in your lips than there are in your cheek skin , for example .\nYou \u2019 re losing a lot more water through your lips , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that really takes the brunt of the weather and the dryness.\n\u201d Essentially , most lips have no shot at staying supple all winter long without some intervention , so having an effective lip balm on hand is imperative .\nWhat you should look for in a lip balm As is the case for any hydrating product , you want the ingredients in your lip balm to include humectants , emollients , and occlusives , according to Dr. Hadley King , a board-certified dermatologist and clinical instructor of dermatology at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says that having all three is particularly important for good lip products because some have humectants without the emollients and occlusives , which will actually dehydrate the lips in dry environments .\n\u201c Lips can definitely take a lot more oil and what we would characterize as emollients than other places on the skin , \u201d Rabach said .\n\u201c Even for people that have acne problems who generally want to stay away from more oily or thick kinds of emollients , lips can definitely take it all.\n\u201d Emollients are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin and improve skin texture and appearance .\nThey include things like squalane , mineral oil , vitamin E , petrolatum , and ceramides and work very well to help you feel that moisture on your lips .\nRabach suggests slathering on a thick layer of your most emollient-heavy lip products before bed since you don \u2019 t have to worry about talking , eating , or mask-wearing while you sleep .\nThat \u2019 ll allow more healing and prevent the usual dehydration that tends to happen overnight .\nAs far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell specifically suggests looking for ceramides , which are fats or lipids in our skin that keep the water in and the environment out on a microscopic level .\n\u201c With lip balm , it 's more about creating a barrier because it [ chapped lips ] is usually related to lip licking , \u201d she said .\nShe also explained why products that have allergens or disguised drying agents can create a vicious cycle .\n\u201c You get licker \u2019 s dermatitis from frequent licking of your lips , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Campbell said .\n\u201c And then you start using something that potentially has an allergen in it , and you 're more likely to develop allergies on skin that 's already kind of angry.\n\u201d The overwhelming PSA from all of these experts is simple : Avoid potential allergens in lip balms .\nAnd if you \u2019 re unsure about what could potentially irritate you , conduct a patch test before use .\n\u201c Generally in lip products I recommend avoiding ingredients like menthol , camphor , phenol , \u201d said King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put them on but they evaporate quickly and you need to reapply , so it can dry out the skin .\nAny alcohol ingredients can also dry out the lips.\n\u201d Many of the basic lip balms on the market contain those drying alcohols , according to Rabach , which is really for their own benefit .\nThe combination of ingredients in those products gives you that feeling of moisturization but then ultimately dries your lips out , which then makes people addicted to using the balm .\nOne ingredient that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resin-like material made by bees , Campbell said .\nPropolis can be found in some Burt \u2019 s Bee \u2019 s products or other bee-derived balms .\nLip exfoliators that contain salicylic acid can also be irritating , as well as things like cinnamon oil and peppermint oil , which are sometimes in lip balms that are designed for plumping , said King .\nThey \u2019 re supposed to irritate the lips a little to create that plumped effect , but if used more regularly they can cause more serious irritation .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see your dermatologist if you \u2019 re having a hard time even after using one of the highly recommended lip balms on this list , particularly if the issue has to do with lip licking .\nThey can create certain compounded formulations that are safe to apply but

        "content": "The media allowed misinformation to frame \u201c debates \u201d about trans identity and race in education .\nThat has to change .\nThere \u2019 s a long history in the US of setting the terms of debate by centering media narratives around the well-being of white women and children .\nIt \u2019 s usually associated with anti-Black and anti-gay right-wing activism and can be traced back to anti\u2013school integration campaigns in the \u2019 60s , through \u201c save the children \u201d anti-gay campaigns in the \u2019 70s , and even the coverage questioning how children would fare under marriages between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists used similar framing to introduce the so-called controversy over \u201c critical race theory.\n\u201d Attempts to eradicate histories of race in the US are nothing new .\nAs recently as 2011 , activists attempted to ban ethnic studies and Mexican American studies curricula in Arizona .\nBut \u201c ethnic studies \u201d simply doesn \u2019 t have the polarizing \u2014 or \u201c concerning \u201d \u2014 ring necessary to stoke a national panic about existing curricular offerings like studying civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr .\nThe term \u201c critical race theory \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because , as one activist told the New Yorker this summer , to \u201c most \u201d Americans it \u201c connotes hostile , academic , divisive , race-obsessed , poisonous , elitist , anti-American.\n\u201d So a long-term campaign to dismantle any talk of race and history in schools was rebranded as a crusade against critical race theory , even though that term actually refers to a graduate-level theory about the intersections of law , culture , and structural racism that has nothing to do with elementary history in classrooms .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c debates \u201d have been pushed into the media by right-wing activism and conservative politicians through strategic waves of anti-CRT and anti-trans bills .\nThey \u2019 re even timed to purposely inflame conservatives and rally the base for elections .\nBut at this point , it \u2019 s too easy to see anti-trans and anti-Black concern-mongering as just an issue of right-wing misinformation .\nAfter all , these framings are accepted for coverage via the editorial judgments of majority white and cis newsrooms .\nSo-called culture war issues are where the media allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white \u201c anxieties \u201d and fears about a changing world .\nBut the terms for what becomes a culture war story are not decided by the public .\nInstead , they are decided in newsrooms that don \u2019 t mirror reality but certainly help shape it .\nAmerican newsrooms are even whiter than the country as a whole , and it \u2019 s in that context of media echo chambers that \u201c critical race theory \u201d is repackaged as controversial .\nMost Americans believe the history of slavery should be taught , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , polls showed that even the idea that critical race theory drove elections was overstated .\nSimilarly , trans rights are actually not \u201c controversial \u201d in the US population at large .\nBut trans journalists are woefully underrepresented in newsrooms .\nIt \u2019 s predictable that cis journalists talking to each other about transness results in stories that home in on and magnify cis debates about trans identity .\nThis dynamic sidelines the potential richness of good faith exchanges within the trans community about the complexity of existing in a cis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on anti-science or partisan campaigns that exist in the social media ether .\nBut there are other important questions , like the way the media feeds into misinformation by platforming sources that reframe debate outside the terms of the communities these \u201c debates \u201d actually affect .\n\u201c Partisanship \u201d is still the favored term in journalism for talking about media \u201c balance.\n\u201d But considering editorial judgment through partisanship simply recreates existing power imbalances by focusing on issues about race , class , and gender only if they \u2019 re legible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt would mean something quite different if corporate media held itself accountable to the communities it covers rather than political parties .\nCategorizing questions about ethical coverage through partisanship issues also helps ignore uncomfortable realities about news capitalism , like the fact that newsrooms need to make a profit and stories are often packaged for advertisers and imagined white readers .\nFinancial incentives are a major reason why it \u2019 s hard to wean media off engaging with misinformative framings to capture cis and white readers , which still constitute a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these panicked stories feed engagement for Twitter , Facebook , legacy media , and new venture capitalist corporate platforms like Substack .\nIt \u2019 s not an accident that in all the race and trans backlash stories , class is invoked not to call out how white middle- and upper-class perspectives shape newsrooms ( including through media CEOs ) .\nInstead , it is invoked to imply that anti-racism or trans rights are somehow an \u201c elitist \u201d concern .\nThis framing takes pressure off the publications themselves to engage with these issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsrooms .\nBut divorcing stories about class and identity from the real world and existing power structures is a distortion .\nFraming and context shouldn \u2019 t only be dictated by cis white fears and concerns .\nStill , there have been some changes by newsrooms around the framing of stories to acknowledge power imbalances in the real world .\nThe Verge has updated its policies for giving big tech companies anonymity as background sources for articles .\nSome news organizations are questioning the uncritical use of police sources when ascertaining the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned parents \u201d might be less obviously identifiable as problematic sources , but it \u2019 s a powerful category of people due for a similar reckoning .\nTellingly , after a backlash to the white framing of its \u201c how young is too young \u201d CRT story , CBS changed the headline \u2014 not to , say , \u201c White Parents Are Finally Having to Grapple with Questions Others Routinely Do.\n\u201d Instead , it was replaced with a nonclickbait-y mouthful : \u201c Documentary explores debate over how and when race should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framing to \u201c debate \u201d is the customary way mainstream media dodges any pressure about \u201c taking sides.\n\u201d But platforming \u201c both sides \u201d implies we live in an already equal world .\nWe don \u2019 t .\nAnd that \u2019 s a fact .\n\u25cf",

Steve Scalise , to the 2011 attack in Arizona that wounded then-representative Gabby Giffords and killed six others .\n\u201c The link to political incitement was clear , \u201d read the language Bennet added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting and a 2010 map produced by Palin \u2019 s PAC that featured gun crosshairs over the districts of vulnerable Democrats in Congress , including Giffords \u2019 .\nIn fact , there was no established link between that map and the gunman in the Giffords shooting , who had a mental illness .\nBennet described how hours after the piece was first published online he received an email late that night from Times columnist Ross Douthat , complaining about the false link between the Palin PAC and the 2011 shooting .\nBennet said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something unintended , but he then checked Twitter and observed others making the same criticism .\n\u201c That is not the message we intended to send , \u201d Bennet said .\nPalin attorney Shane Vogt asked Bennet why he didn \u2019 t immediately move to unpublish the piece , but Bennet said the newspaper has a policy against removing stories and that it had already been sent to the printers for the next day \u2019 s hard copy .\nInstead , Bennet testified , he emailed Williamson and a fact-checker around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researching the Arizona gunman \u2019 s motives and whether the map was involved in any way , so they could begin the process of correcting the piece if needed .\n\u201c We were really scrambling to try to address this , \u201d Bennet told the court .\nThe evidence previously shown to the jury included messages between Bennet and Williamson in which she apologized to him and wrote she \u201c should have read those [ paragraphs he had written ] more closely and asked more questions.\n\u201d \u201c No worries .\nI feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote .\n\u201c I just moved too fast .\nI \u2019 m sorry.\n\u201d He also responded again to Douthat via email , telling the columnist he felt \u201c lousy \u201d about the error , which he wrote \u201c reads like partisan scorekeeping.\n\u201d Under the law , for Palin to succeed in her case she must prove that Bennet and the newspaper acted with \u201c actual malice , \u201d meaning he acted either with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the statement \u2019 s falsity .\nGabe Rottman , the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , told BuzzFeed News that the so-called actual malice rule takes into consideration the idea that reporters may occasionally make unintentional mistakes when working against a deadline .\n`` I think the key thing is understanding the nature of news .\nIt \u2019 s a competitive business and competitiveness is actually good for public discourse , '' Rottman said .\n`` The free flow of information quickly is important for an informed electorate . ''\n`` If it were possible for an honest reporter who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit every time they do , then that will chill reporting .\nIt will mean fewer stories and less investigative journalism , '' Rottman said .\n`` That \u2019 s why the actual malice rule is there .

        "content": "While pandemic-related stress , anxiety , and grief due to the more than 900,000 COVID deaths in the US have had a well-documented impact on mental health , changes in daily life , like staying home for extended periods of time , can also affect other parts of your body , including your eyes , skin , and ability to focus .\nBuzzFeed News spoke to several doctors and experts about how spending more time at home can transform bodies in the short and long term .\nSpending more time indoors is known to increase the risk of nearsightedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in JAMA Ophthalmology suggested that during the pandemic , there were 1.4 to 3 times more cases of myopia in 2020 among children ages 6 to 8 than in the previous five years .\nThat wasn \u2019 t the case for kids ages 9 to 13 , who didn \u2019 t experience increases in myopia diagnoses .\nThe link is less studied in adults , but Dr. Mika Moy , an eye doctor and health sciences clinical professor at the University of California , Berkeley School of Optometry , said she isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients .\nHowever , close work ( spending hours reading or looking at something less than 20 centimeters , or about 7 to 8 inches distance from your face ) coupled with low light levels are thought to play a role in increased myopia risk .\n\u201c There 's other sort of generalizations , like people who live in cities tend to be more nearsighted than people who live in the country , and we think that 's because we 're finding there 's a protective connection with the outdoors , \u201d Moy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only eye-related problem that \u2019 s occurring during the pandemic .\nFor eyes , lockdowns in March 2020 were like having to \u201c run marathons without any training , \u201d Moy told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Your meetings are on the screen , your work is on the screen , and now everyone 's leisure time seems to also be on these screens.\n\u201d Often people forget to blink when staring at a screen for a long time , which deprives their eyes of moisturizing tears .\nWe \u2019 re also stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that secrete oil into our tears every time we blink .\nBlinking less can cause the glands to \u201c shrink away , \u201d Moy said , which isn \u2019 t good in the long run .\nEye drops called artificial tears can help relieve dryness , but they may not work as well as warm compresses .\nMoy suggests placing a warm washcloth over your eyes for 10 minutes about two times a day to feel relief .\nYou can also develop eye fatigue , which occurs when the muscles that control your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ; some people may get headaches or experience blurry vision as a result , Moy said .\nBlue light exposure is another factor to consider , which electronic devices emit .\nIt has one of the shorter yet higher energy wavelengths on the visible light spectrum , but experts agree there isn \u2019 t strong scientific evidence that shows it actually causes eye fatigue or damage .\n( Too much of it at night can make it harder for you to fall asleep , though , Moy said . )\nSo yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from staring at your computer all day , but the infamous blue light probably isn \u2019 t the culprit here .\nIn fact , the sun produces at least 100 times more blue light than a typical smartphone , the American Optometric Association says .\nThis means your fancy blue light glasses may not be doing much ; the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn \u2019 t recommend them .\nAnecdotally , however , Moy said her patients think they \u2019 re helpful ( personally , I think so , too , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne pair of glasses that might help are computer glasses , or \u201c occupational lenses , \u201d which are prescription frames that correct your vision specifically for computer-length distance , preventing your eyes from working too hard .\nThere are also some nonprescription reading glasses that are specifically made for computer work .\nOne of the best things you can do is give your eyes a break and try the 20-20-20 rule : every 20 minutes look 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds .\nOtherwise , take some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more ways than one .\nAlthough being indoors can protect you from sunburns and major risks of skin cancer from exposure to ultraviolet light , your vitamin D levels can drop because you \u2019 re not absorbing sunlight that helps your body produce it , notes Dr. Elizabeth Bahar Houshmand , a double board-certified dermatologist in Texas .\nVitamin D supports immune health , muscle function , brain activity , and the absorption of important minerals such as calcium , magnesium , and phosphate .\nStudies show vitamin D deficiency is associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone and muscle issues ( more on that later ) , and other health problems .\nA lack of sunlight exposure , darker skin , and older age increase your chances of having a deficiency .\nThe good news is that at least one 2021 study published in the European Journal of Public Health found that vitamin D deficiency was no more common in patients in Italy during 2020 lockdowns compared with previous years , suggesting it may not always be an issue for those of us spending extra time at home during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of sun exposure is necessary for your body to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D. Stepping outside for \u201c a few minutes a day is enough , \u201d Dr. Joshua Zeichner , director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , told BuzzFeed News .\nYou can also get your vitamin D from fortified foods , supplements , and certain foods like salmon and egg yolks .\nWhat both dermatologists have noticed during the pandemic is more patients coming in with rashes , acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes facial redness and pimplelike bumps on the skin .\nZeichner blames face masks , stress , and poor eating habits ( namely , eating too much sugar ) .\nSugar can promote inflammation in the body and drive oil production that can lead to acne breakouts , he said .\nOver time , excess sugar can trigger glycation \u2014 when sugar molecules attach to proteins in your skin called collagen \u2014 which can contribute to wrinkles , he said .\nRegular exercise can help .\nIt keeps your skin cells functioning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeichner said .\n\u201c The days may seem long and repetitive , but keep up with your skincare routine , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What you do now certainly will have an impact on your skin in the future.\n\u201d Then there \u2019 s a less obvious but still insidious impact on your body ( and mind ) .\nPeople are spending more time in Zoom meetings where staring at themselves in the harsh glare of a computer is making them more self-conscious about the way they look .\nBoth dermatologists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get rid of dark spots , wrinkles , and undereye bags .\nZeichner recommends wearing sunscreen , even indoors because harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can still pierce through windows and penetrate your skin .\nVarious stress-inducing pollutants also exist inside your home , Houshmand said , especially in the winter when central heating and lack of fresh air can dry your skin ; she recommends setting up a humidifier in your home to help .\nIf you \u2019 re anything like Michel , the 23-year-old with back trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains associated with turning your home into a workspace .\nDr. Charla Fischer , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News she \u2019 s seeing more patients come in with back pain related to poor posture while working from home .\n\u201c We sit in a bad position all day , hunched over a laptop , and the muscles get overstretched and microtears develop .\nThen the muscle starts to cramp because of this injury , and we get pain , \u201d Fischer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just an achy back .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c as dangerous for your health as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day , \u201d Dr. Nicholas DiNubile , an orthopedic surgeon at Premier Orthopedics And Sports Medicine in Pennsylvania and American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons spokesperson , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c We already have a big problem in our nation with this , and the pandemic only made it worse.\n\u201d Add inactivity with a lack of vitamin D and you have a \u201c real issue , \u201d DiNubile said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone health , but also muscle injuries , and tears are more common when levels are low.\n\u201d Kids , for example , are getting more injuries now that they \u2019 re returning to physical activities after about two years of home confinement .\n\u201c Never in my entire career have I gone two weeks without seeing an ACL injury , \u201d DiNubile said , yet at the beginning of the pandemic , about five months passed with no injured kid in sight .\n\u201c Now it \u2019 s payback .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being sedentary could lead to loss of muscle , too , which could slow metabolism and contribute to weight gain and obesity , he added .\nAnd over two-plus years , osteoporosis , or bone thinning , could become an issue , which is particularly worrisome for white and Asian women , postmenopausal women , and teenagers ( given bone health is built in teen years ) , DiNubile said .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important to make sure your home is equipped to support your body as best as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ergonomically appropriate equipment , like a monitor , adjustable office chair , keyboard , computer mouse , and proper back support .\nYou should set your monitor at eye level , keyboard at lap level , and both knees at a 90-degree angle , Fischer suggests , and incorporate standing breaks , short walks , and stretching into your daily routine to prevent future pain .\nSeating arrangements without cushions and solid back support will allow your body to slouch and form a \u201c C \u201d curve , said Fischer , who \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dining chair instead ( you can buy lumbar support pillows that fit any chair ) , and only use your bed for sleeping , she said .\n\u201c Mattresses are not designed for us to sit and do work on them.\n\u201d Our brains are incredibly adaptive , constantly adjusting to their surroundings .\nBut for some , shifting workplaces and social situations can have some surprising and unexpected impacts on daily life .\nJohn Redding , 46 , of Texas , said his inability to focus even for short periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor nuisance to a major issue , \u201d even with the help of medication .\n\u201c I used to be a voracious reader , but I have n't read an entire book since the pandemic started.\n\u201d Sam Ling , an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University , told BuzzFeed News some people may be less productive at home because there are more distractions there .\nHowever , that \u2019 s not the case for everyone .\nSereena Millward , 28 , told us she struggles to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office again .\n\u201c The sounds of people talking and eating at their desk grate on me , but I also can \u2019 t concentrate if it \u2019 s deadly silent.\n\u201d ( This feeling is called misophonia . )\nThat \u2019 s because a shift in how people interact from in person to online \u2014 and then back again \u2014 can be a bit of adjustment .\n\u201c There \u2019 s exhaustion that \u2019 s involved in monitoring social cues when there \u2019 s so little information available , \u201d Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimuli overload when we return to face-to-face interactions that may be overwhelming for some .\nLing noted that retraining our brains to socialize as we used to could take some time .\nThe brain is a muscle ; the parts we don \u2019 t exercise regularly will get a little wonky .\n\u201c COVID has promoted this hermitlike life , \u201d he said , although he doesn \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve permanently rewired our \u201c pretty plastic \u201d brains to solely tolerate the comfort of our homes .\n\u201c On so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest experiments that has ever been done on the human brain.\n\u201d Pandemic home life has been a blessing in disguise for some people .\nIt helped Abby Adesanya , 29 , experience a specific ( and pleasurable ) bodily sensation for the first time in April 2020 as she was listening to Dua Lipa \u2019 s Future Nostalgia album alone in her New York apartment .\n\u201c I was blasting the album , throwing my hands in the air , wishing I could be dancing in the clubs to this .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders start to vibrate , and it spread down my arms.\n\u201d Adesanya was experiencing frisson : the chills and goosebumps often felt after listening to music or watching something in synchrony .\nAnywhere between 55 % to 86 % of people experience frisson , yet Adesanya had never felt it .\n\u201c I can not believe my body suddenly just unlocked this ability .\nI do n't know if it was trying to fill in the blanks for missing stimuli .\nBut the fact it 's here is so cool , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really dark time.\n\u201d Ling said he isn \u2019 t surprised by Adesanya \u2019 s breakthrough .\nIt \u2019 s possible when going from a hyperstimulated environment such as life in New York City to a quiet apartment that the reduction in stimuli helped unbusy her mind .\nIt \u2019 s what meditation does for many people , he said .\nAnother body part that might have suffered during the pandemic is your teeth .\nThe cost and need for insurance normally prevents many people from going to the dentist , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dental work , added another barrier to routine checkups .\nKelly Holst , an assistant professor at Temple University \u2019 s Kornberg School of Dentistry in Pennsylvania , told BuzzFeed News this worsened dental problems for many people .\n\u201c There 's only so much you can do at home .\nYou can \u2019 t scrape off the plaque , food debris , and bacteria that harden and calcify on your teeth \u201d without a dentists \u2019 help , said Holst , who also noticed an uptick in patients with preexisting dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse boat.\n\u201d Pandemic-related stress and missed appointments have left some people with jaw pain associated with teeth grinding , too , she added .\nExtra time at home also means more , often unnecessary , snacking , which is \u201c notoriously bad for your oral health \u201d and clears the way for cavities to form , Holst said .\n\u201c At work , you 're sort of more regimented with your food intake .\nAt home , you kind of have that freedom to graze.\n\u201d Certain acidic foods and drinks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sports drinks , soda , and alcohol ) can contribute to demineralization in your enamel \u2014 the outer layer of your teeth and strongest tissue in your body \u2014 and make your mouth more acidic by throwing off your oral pH level , Holst said .\nDon \u2019 t want to put down the snacks ?\nHolst suggests you eat or drink them right away and avoid nibbling or sipping throughout the day .\nThat way you give your mouth time to naturally recalibrate itself .\nOtherwise , use fluoride toothpaste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine cleanings , and use an electric toothbrush , she said .\nSeveral people we spoke to said their body size experienced the most change during the pandemic .\nSome people lost weight , others gained .\nPatr\u00edcia Romano , 26 , used to struggle to gain weight ( she blames genetics and stress ) , but when her job became remote in 2020 , she stopped walking to and from work and gained 11 pounds .\nInstead of skipping lunch and dinner on the regular , she started eating more homemade meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to .\nBut the weight gain was rough for Romano , who \u2019 s a lawyer in Brazil .\nShe became obsessed with analyzing her body in the mirror and noticing flaws that many others likely couldn \u2019 t notice .\nIt got so bad that Romano took regular pregnancy tests because she would \u201c see a huge stomach , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c Now that some time has passed , it does n't bother me as much anymore , \u201d Romano said .\n\u201c I gave up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing it as this new body that has endured the delicate time of a worldwide stressful situation.\n\u201d Heidi ( who didn \u2019 t feel comfortable sharing her last name ) told us she got so tired of cooking for herself at home that she \u201c ended up eating less and losing a bunch of weight , which triggered some weird fatigue issues that were made worse with pandemic burnout and work-from-home/isolation.\n\u201d In general , you shouldn \u2019 t feel bad about weight changes during the pandemic .\nWe \u2019 ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nOne part of your body may have been particularly sensitive to all the changes related to your diet , mental health , and activity levels during the pandemic \u2014 your gastrointestinal tract .\nDr. Sarah McGill , an associate professor of medicine specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , told BuzzFeed News many patients say added stress and loneliness during the pandemic has led to an increase in abdominal pain , diarrhea , and nausea .\n\u201c The GI tract has even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we feel can cause GI distress , \u201d McGill said .\nWhat \u2019 s more , people increased their drinking during the pandemic , which isn \u2019 t a positive trend given alcohol is directly toxic to your GI tract , can cause fat to accumulate in your liver , and contribute to liver damage , McGill said .\nA Johns Hopkins survey of 832 adults over 21 found 60 % reported increased drinking in May 2020 compared to pre-COVID times and 34 % reported binge drinking .\nStress , alcohol availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers for increased drinking .\nFor Beth Boardman , 61 , a writer and retired nurse in California , regular afternoon wine on an empty stomach led her to develop acute gastritis and esophagitis , or inflammation of the lining of the stomach and esophagus .\nMcGill said you should avoid alcohol as much as you can , and exercise regularly , which will keep your bowel movements flowing as they should , help you maintain a stable weight , and keep your heart healthy .\nSpeaking of bowel movements , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending more time at home .\nWhile some people may have experienced more constipation from a suddenly sedentary lifestyle , others may have seen an improvement from an increased ability to listen to body cues \u2014 and easier access to a bathroom .\nHolding back bowel movements \u2014 for example , because you \u2019 re commuting or working in a busy office \u2014 can make constipation more likely , McGill said .\nSo , it \u2019 s safe to say spending more time at home may have made going to the bathroom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced diet consisting of fruits , vegetables , and fiber-rich whole grains is important to keep things running smoothly , whether you are spending time at home or more time out of the house .\n\u201c Fiber directly contributes to gut health by feeding the trillions of microorganisms we have there , which in turn help us with our mood , metabolism , and lots of other aspects of health , \u201d McGill said .",

        "content": "When New York \u2019 s attorney general was accused of abusing women , one friend decided that instead of cutting him out of her life , she would try to make him reckon with the harm he inflicted .\nThe experiment they undertook underscores the tantalizing promise \u2014 and the painful limitations \u2014 of moral redemption for men outed by # MeToo .\nEric Schneiderman paced around his prewar Upper West Side apartment in what he would later call a \u201c crazed bunker mentality , \u201d trying to make sense of the past few days .\nAs New York \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero to liberals nationwide for his leading role in the anti-Trump resistance .\nThat changed when the New Yorker reported that multiple women had accused him of physical and emotional abuse .\nWithin hours , Schneiderman learned his longtime rival , then-governor Andrew Cuomo , had ordered a criminal investigation , after which Schneiderman felt compelled to resign .\nSince then he had cloistered himself inside , taking covert house calls from his psychiatrist and hiding from the reporters who camped out in lawn chairs on the street below .\nHis lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements , but privately he obsessed over the injustices he felt he had suffered , from the article , which he thought was unfair , to the political allies who had hastily abandoned him .\nAs Schneiderman stewed in denial and resentment , he got a message from a friend , Anna Graham Hunter , that shook him out of his bitter reverie .\nOn May 7 , 2018 , the day Schneiderman \u2019 s life changed forever , Hunter was sitting at her computer , wrapping up an article for the Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence-breakers \u201d were struggling after coming forward .\nShe was one of them .\n\u201c Why have I been so angry ?\n\u201d she wrote .\n\u201c Shouldn \u2019 t I be feeling better now that my story is out there ?\n\u201d He wasn \u2019 t the only one .\nThroughout her life Hunter had had a variety of upsetting experiences with men , some of which she now categorized as sexual assault .\nOther women could commiserate with her , but it usually concluded with \u201c men are trash , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorphin hit of self-righteousness , those aren \u2019 t fun thoughts to have , and I don \u2019 t know that they ultimately lead to lasting change.\n\u201d Therapists only wanted to talk about childhood trauma , and other men she knew were too defensive to engage .\nHunter wanted to know why all these guys were the way they were .\nShe craved thornier conversations around abuse , sex , and power , but so far she hadn \u2019 t been able to find anyone who wanted to wade into what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Schneiderman would go there with her .\nHunter believed the women who had accused Schneiderman , and she felt deeply conflicted about reaching out to the man who hurt them , but perhaps , she told herself , their dialogue could serve a larger purpose .\nShe figured she couldn \u2019 t be the only one with questions that # MeToo had not been able to resolve \u2014 questions that felt necessary to explore if the movement was to lead to enduring cultural transformation .\nHunter certainly didn \u2019 t think abusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims had any obligation to them whatsoever .\nBut she did wonder if it was ever possible for someone who was capable of such terrible acts to change .\nIt was impossible to know , since almost none of the prominent men outed by # MeToo appeared to have seriously tried .\nWhat would a genuine apology sound like ?\nWhat would constitute true remorse ?\nWas rehabilitation a realistic goal , and , if so , what would that process entail ?\n\u201c Right now I care about the feelings of everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about your feelings , \u201d Hunter wrote to Schneiderman four days later .\n\u201c You have no idea how this has gutted so many , many people , people that I care about and love .\nNo idea .\nThis is by far the worst # MeToo story to come out in many ways.\n\u201d She laid into him for what she saw as sexual entitlement and publicly masked misogyny : \u201c You have some serious fucking reckoning to do.\n\u201d \u201c I will continue to have many ups and downs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote .\n\u201c You 're still my friend , and I still love you , but I am not going to be an easy shoulder for you.\n\u201d \u201c I had to sleep on this one , \u201d Schneiderman wrote Hunter back the next day .\n\u201c I accept the hard shoulder role you are uniquely qualified to play , but it may take a little time before I can fully lean into this conversation .\nYou may not care about my feelings , but I am still reeling from the multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mental state is pretty fragile right now .\nAlthough I go way up and way down .\nI know the path forward includes taking full responsibility for everything I have done , but I am only capable of taking things day by day right now .\nI hope you can understand that , even if you think less of me because of it .\nHaving said all that , this conversation is very important to me .\nI hope we can take it up again when I am better equipped to engage.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ had over the next three and a half years \u2014 on the phone , in emails , over meals , and during long walks through Manhattan \u2019 s Riverside Park \u2014 were at times revelatory .\nThey helped Hunter better understand the harm men had done to her and how it had shaped her .\nAnd they helped Schneiderman understand that he did not deserve to hold a position of power again .\nIt took Hunter a few days to contact him .\n\u201c I went around in torturous loops , \u201d she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any point in spending my energy talking to Eric when I could be supporting women instead.\n\u201d Schneiderman \u2019 s press team had advance notice that the New Yorker was investigating his relationships , but he had told them not to worry \u2014 back then he was so \u201c oblivious , \u201d he said , that he didn \u2019 t feel his personal life would interest a journalist .\nHe knew he had problems : alcoholism , workaholism , maybe even narcissism .\nBut although as attorney general he had pursued high-profile # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see a connection between what he felt were simply personal shortcomings and the crimes he was accused of .\nHe had never interrogated why he enjoyed what he then thought of as \u201c rough sex , \u201d he said .\nThe way he saw it , some of the women he dated were into choking , slapping , and dark role-play , and some weren \u2019 t .\nIn his mind , he tested their boundaries , but he didn \u2019 t force anyone who told him to stop , which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe had other exes who backed that up .\nOne former girlfriend , Lorna Brett , who dated Schneiderman between Manning Barish and Selvaratnam , told me that in her experience he clearly understood that \u201c no means no.\n\u201d His ex-wife , Jennifer Cunningham , issued a statement at the time saying she didn \u2019 t believe the allegations , which were \u201c completely inconsistent \u201d with the man she had known for 35 years .\nThe New Yorker gave Schneiderman three and a half hours to respond to the claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy of intimate relationships , \u201d he said in a statement , \u201c I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity .\nI have not assaulted anyone .\nI have never engaged in nonconsensual sex , which is a line I would not cross.\n\u201d He also denied ever threatening to kill anyone .\nWhen Schneiderman \u2019 s attorneys were preparing him for the criminal investigation Cuomo ordered , they recovered messages that they believed showed the women had not just consented but pursued relationships with him after the alleged abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have the opportunity to show the New Yorker this evidence .\nHe was eager to tell Hunter about the other ex-partners who still supported him and the holes he saw in the story , using what she called his \u201c politician voice.\n\u201d \u201c He wanted me on his side , and he considered being on his side believing that he was wronged , \u201d Hunter said .\nThose early conversations were maddening for her , and she often raged at him .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what you didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .\n\u201c I care what you did do.\n\u201d Despite his bitterness , Schneiderman said , he didn \u2019 t want to follow in the footsteps of the many other famous men who refused to resign from their jobs or otherwise accept any responsibility after being called out .\nNor did he want to take refuge in one of the numerous safe spaces , from men \u2019 s rights forums to right-wing podcasts , for resentful men who want to nurse their grievances about # MeToo .\nHunter had told Schneiderman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his therapist but impossible to deal with after a meeting with his lawyers .\nSo he devised a code word , \u201c criminal defense loop , \u201d that Hunter could wield whenever Schneiderman started arguing his case , after which they would move on to more productive ground .\nOver those first six months , Schneiderman completed an in-patient alcohol rehabilitation program , committed to sobriety , and started weekly therapy .\nHe had always been drawn to meditation , and he revived his practice and Dharma study , which allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It helped me to be in my body , to get out of my jabbering mind , and to really be able to identify difficult feelings , and instead of running away from them , be able to sit with them , \u201d he said .\nDuring our interviews , he sometimes fingered the 108 Buddhist mala beads he wears on his wrist to remind him \u201c to breathe.\n\u201d He and Hunter also started a \u201c feminist book club , \u201d discussing challenging work by writers from New York magazine \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Wilber .\nThey read Moira Donegan on why she started the \u201c Shitty Media Men \u201d list and Tarana Burke on # MeToo \u2019 s origin story .\nThey cast a wide net , covering the Black women left out of the suffrage movement , sexual abuse in the Catholic Church , and research on false memories .\nBy approaching these topics intellectually , Schneiderman began to understand \u201c the scope of misogyny and sexism and patriarchy , how it permeated my life , how it permeated our culture , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to apply what he was learning to himself .\nIn September , four months after Schneiderman resigned , millions of Americans watched as Christine Blasey Ford testified that she had been sexually assaulted by prospective Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when they were both in high school .\nAs they continued their wide-ranging discussions , Hunter , on edge from the hearings , started to feel that Schneiderman was showing more interest in the possibilities for abusers \u2019 redemption than in victims \u2019 pain .\n\u201c I know that the hardest part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think what I think , \u201d she wrote him in an email .\n\u201c And you want me to understand your experience .\nBut for fuck 's sake , it 's been all about men and their pain and anger for centuries .\nI 'm over it .\nEvery woman I know is over it.\n\u201d \u201c I appreciate your honesty , but what you seem to be saying is that right now you can \u2019 t muster up much in the way of compassion for men , \u201d Schneiderman wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nDoes that feel ok ?\nIt sounds like for you it does .\nBut in my experience , you can \u2019 t hear or see someone you have no compassion for , which probably makes any meaningful dialogue impossible.\n\u201d \u201c To have you ask how I feel about not having compassion for men ... just wow , \u201d Hunter wrote back .\n\u201c You may not want to talk to me right now .\nBut what I may have meant is I don \u2019 t want to talk to you.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exhausted by how \u201c the public credibility \u201d of the # MeToo movement \u201c seems to rest on individual stories.\n\u201d The \u201c constant cross examination of every woman \u2019 s account \u201d made it difficult for her to be interested in the nuances of Schneiderman \u2019 s own experiences or care at all about the feelings of men in his position .\n\u201c I \u2019 m terrified that one tiny chink will make the whole thing come tumbling down , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c The Kavanaugh hearings felt like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026 I don \u2019 t think you understand the collective experience of women who \u2019 ve been abused by men and had our experiences be invisible for our entire lives until a year ago .\nHow could you ?\n\u201d Schneiderman replied , thanking Hunter for her honesty and conceding that he had been ignoring that collective experience : \u201c Looking at women \u2019 s stories as the tales of individuals with agency ( and who must take responsibility for their own roles in any situation ) misses the overwhelming , crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every situation.\n\u201d At first , Schneiderman felt disgusted by Kavanaugh , who struck him as \u201c the big WASP-y jock \u201d who would have bullied him in school .\nBut in therapy , he had been unpacking his upbringing \u2014 private school in Manhattan , followed by Amherst and Harvard \u2014 and his relationships with his mother and his father , who , like Schneiderman , was a powerful attorney and a \u201c functional alcoholic.\n\u201d When he later read an essay on Kavanaugh \u2019 s privilege , the similarities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharper focus .\nThey both had \u201c benefitted from the American patriarchal structure , \u201d Schneiderman said , and were both brought up to think they could \u201c make the rules and therefore break the rules and prosper.\n\u201d When I asked Hunter why she kept speaking to Schneiderman even when he upset her , she cited dialogues like the one above .\nShe was intrigued by his willingness to be honest with himself \u2014 even if it was a slow and difficult process \u2014 and to keep reading what made him uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cathartic .\n\u201c I felt like so much of the # MeToo conversation was just women talking to other women and talking about what we wanted to say to men who had done bad things , and now I could actually say it to his face and he had to listen to every word , \u201d Hunter said .\nMeanwhile , Manning Barish and Selvaratnam were writing through their trauma \u2014 Manning Barish on social media , Selvaratnam for the New York Times .\nSelvaratnam began working on a memoir about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrast between Schneiderman \u2019 s actions and his do-gooder persona .\n\u201c His outward-facing spirituality was a mask for the torment beneath the surface , \u201d she later wrote .\n\u201c His outward-facing feminism was a mask for his misogyny.\n\u201d Hunter and Schneiderman were exploring similar themes together .\nWhen they read \u201c The Rub of Rough Sex \u201d by Chelsea Summers \u2014 an essay that focused on Schneiderman himself and considered how progressive men have used \u201c kink as a cover for abuse \u201d \u2014 he felt seen in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The essay \u201c really got me to look at my sexual activity , and say , OK , is there something deeper going on here that I \u2019 m missing ?\n\u201d Schneiderman recalled .\nAfter months of reading and thinking , he said he realized he had sought to control the women in his life and felt entitled to sex not just because of the sexist culture he grew up in but because of the authority that his job conferred .\nEspecially during the Trump years , when he gained national stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean of power and privilege , but I didn \u2019 t even know I was underwater , \u201d Schneiderman told me .\nThe more his star rose , the more arrogant he became .\n\u201c Power creeps up on you , \u201d he said .\nHe came to see that it wasn \u2019 t right to have engaged in what he had thought of as \u201c rough sex \u201d without clear rules in advance , not to mention ongoing communication and trust \u2014 and that he \u201c had consent wrong \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing to them , that meant they were OK with it .\n\u201c While in some senses that may be legal consent , it \u2019 s not ethical consent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And the ethical consent requires me to make an inquiry into what a partner really wants and really likes .\nAnd I \u2019 m very much ashamed of the fact that I gave that so little thought.\n\u201d In November 2018 , Madeline Singas , then the district attorney who Cuomo had appointed to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to pursue charges against him , citing \u201c legal impediments , \u201d including statutes of limitation .\nIt was a huge relief for Schneiderman .\n\u201c I was able to get out of my \u2018 criminal defense loop , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nThe public statement he put out was very different from his previous denials .\n\u201c I recognize that District Attorney Singas \u2019 decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong , \u201d it said .\n\u201c I accept full responsibility for my conduct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the impact it had on them .\nAfter spending time in a rehab facility , I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed .\nI apologize for any and all pain that I have caused , and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me . ''\nThat recognition was not lost on the women who said Schneiderman had abused them .\nSelvaratnam later wrote that she found the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even further .\n\u201c I feel completely vindicated by Eric Schneiderman \u2019 s admission that he engaged in the abuse to which he subjected me and the other women , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted .\n\u201c I wish him well in his recovery process.\n\u201d In early 2019 , Schneiderman was at lunch with a friend who called # MeToo overreaching and intolerant and questioned whether there was anything men could ever do to appease their accusers .\nActually , Schneiderman told them , Time \u2019 s Up had recently offered simple instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform your behavior .\nMake restitution to those harmed .\n( His friend confirmed this exchange . )\nAfterward , Schneiderman emailed Hunter about the conversation .\n\u201c Oddly enough , I found myself in the role of defending the movement , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c It felt kind of good to be able to lay all of this out .\nAnd I felt somewhat calmer.\n\u201d Along with meditation , Schneiderman had been consulting with his rabbi , J. Rolando Matalon , who told me that there \u2019 s biblical precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAn elaborate priestly ritual described in the Book of Leviticus reintegrated people who had been separated from their community due to contagious skin diseases .\nMatalon thought that , similarly , there could be a ritual that would publicly reintroduce people who had been excluded because of moral offenses if they were able to make amends .\nHowever , Matalon counseled Schneiderman , Judaism makes clear \u201c that a pariah can not return without a serious process of repentance and personal transformation , and directly apologizing to those he has harmed.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction .\nAll she had ever wanted from Hoffman was for him to acknowledge and empathize with his accusers \u2019 claims .\nBut \u201c in the absence of any genuine apology , we were out for vengeance , \u201d she said .\nHunter and Schneiderman looked together for meaningful examples of apologies that sought to actively make things right , not just to individual survivors but to the larger public , but couldn \u2019 t find many .\nOne study of over 200 statements by people accused of sexual misconduct amid the # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included an apology of any kind .\nAnother found that even the highest-quality apologies \u2014 detailed , not defensive \u2014 left the public dissatisfied .\nThere was a single apology that Hunter and Schneiderman found inspiring .\nIn January 2018 , TV writer Dan Harmon apologized on his podcast to his former employee Megan Ganz , saying he realized he lacked respect for women , had hidden behind his progressive politics , and never would have changed his behavior if she hadn \u2019 t accused him publicly on Twitter .\nAfterward , Ganz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneiderman was nervous he \u2019 d get it wrong .\nAfter he graduated earlier that year from a meditation class in Manhattan , the studio posted a photo of its newly certified students .\nWhen Manning Barish found out , she was outraged .\nSchneiderman was \u201c an untreated sexual assaulter and predator , \u201d she tweeted .\n\u201c He has no business teaching meditation .\nHe has not even been rehabilitated yet.\n\u201d He told me he had no intention of teaching and that the class was for anyone who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the story , and he was banned from the studio .\nThe experience made him feel like it would be easier to stay silent .\n\u201c My male friends often say to me : don \u2019 t even try to apologize , \u201d he once wrote to Hunter in an email .\n\u201c Whatever you say won \u2019 t be enough .\nYou will be attacked all over again and will have admitted to wrongdoing.\n\u201d Hunter encouraged Schneiderman to push past his anxieties \u2014 if he had apologized earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing progress , maybe the meditation class incident would never have happened .\nIn February , she suggested he start with Selvaratnam .\nThe night before , Hunter and Schneiderman had discussed Selvaratnam \u2019 s New York Times article , in which she said he had \u201c tested \u201d her by giving her little slaps .\n\u201c I have never heard you understand Tanya \u2019 s point of view like you did last night , \u201d Hunter wrote to him .\n\u201c How it \u2019 s a slippery slope of giving in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for the sake of staying with someone.\n\u201d \u201c I am now clear : I am very , very sorry for my appalling conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote in a draft version .\n\u201c I have a lot more work to do and amends to make , but I felt that it was important to reach out as a work in progress and to tell you that I am sorry.\n\u201d It was brutally hard to face up to what he had done , he wrote , and for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what he did with any clarity .\n\u201c None of this excuses my conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c From the beginning , I bossed you around .\nMaybe lightheartedly at first , but over time , I became less and less considerate and more and more nasty and controlling .\nAnd I pushed you to go along with things in bed that I now recognize you did not want to do.\n\u201d He never asked her whether their relationship worked for her , he wrote .\nInstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply ashamed .\n\u201c I have a long way to go , but I am committed to doing the work I need to do to become a better , healthier human being , and to ensure that I never behave the way I did with you with anyone else ever again , \u201d he wrote .\nHunter was overcome after she read the draft .\n\u201c I think I \u2019 ve been honest about how emotional this is for me \u2014 that the weight I \u2019 m putting on this apology goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote to him .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not saying that \u2019 s right or healthy , but I haven \u2019 t spent the last 10 months talking to you so intensely just because you \u2019 re my friend and I care about you \u2026 Having you get to the point where you could even write a letter like this is all I have wanted since we started talking .\nFor you to GET IT .\nAs I said ... in many ways you \u2019 re a stand-in for all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , because they won \u2019 t even try.\n\u201d Schneiderman never sent the letter .\nShortly after he drafted it , he learned that a state committee that investigates wrongdoing by Manhattan attorneys was conducting a probe into the allegations against him .\nIf the First Department appellate court found him responsible , he could be suspended or disbarred from practicing law .\nThat wasn \u2019 t a consequence Schneiderman was willing to accept .\nHe shelved his apology plans , convinced that if he reached out to the women it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lawyered up again , reentering the \u201c criminal defense loop \u201d he had worked so hard to overcome .\nRecords show that his attorney \u2019 s response to the committee did not reflect Schneiderman \u2019 s newfound understanding of consent .\nInstead , it reiterated his old arguments , protesting that his \u201c consensual relationships with his romantic partners in the confines of his bedroom \u201d should not be subject to further scrutiny .\nWhen Schneiderman was deposed for the investigation in January 2020 , he said Manning Barish and Selvaratnam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c dominant-submissive \u201d sex life , according to the committee records .\n\u201c I \u2019 m confident that neither one of them ever after sex or the next morning said \u2018 I don \u2019 t like what you did , don \u2019 t do that anymore \u2019 or any words to that effect , \u201d he said .\nAll those emails and texts that Schneiderman had worked hard not to dwell on were deployed in an attempt to discredit the women .\nHe said in his deposition that , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her life , she had fought to stay together when he broke things off , \u201c devastated \u201d to lose him not \u201c just as a romantic partner but as a teammate for her career.\n\u201d He argued that the New Yorker was wrong that the anonymous woman in the Hamptons rebuffed him after he slapped her , and that the magazine had failed to report that they had stayed in \u201c warm and flirtatious \u201d touch afterward .\nAs for Manning Barish , the records cited emails from her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him she loved him , missed him , and wanted to marry him .\nReferencing allegations that former New York governor Eliot Spitzer had choked a woman , she said she felt sorry he hadn \u2019 t met the right girl yet .\n\u201c Too soon for you to give him my number ?\n\u201d she quipped .\nUntil Schneiderman , \u201c no one ever understood my darkness , \u201d she wrote to him .\n\u201c I miss that part of me being controlled and celebrated.\n\u201d In his deposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrite statement he had released after the DA declined to prosecute .\nFor the women who said he \u2019 d abused them , that statement had been validating and vindicating .\nFor Schneiderman himself , it had represented crucial progress forward on his path toward self-improvement .\nBut it was the committee \u2019 s job to assess whether he had committed professional misconduct and should be disciplined , not to ensure the women got what they needed to heal .\nAnd to the committee lawyer , it seemed , that statement was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf his relationships with the women were as \u201c vibrant and consensual \u201d as he had just described , the lawyer asked , \u201c for what were you apologizing ?\n\u201d Hunter grew frustrated as she watched from the sidelines .\nShe still held out hope that one day Schneiderman would make full amends to the women , and that they would get the reckoning she herself had never received .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bI was vengeful \u201d toward Hoffman , \u201c but mostly I wanted all of us to stop hurting so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the adversarial legal proceeding made that hope an increasingly distant possibility .\nExperts in restorative justice insist there is a better approach in these types of situations .\nWhether administered through the legal system or outside of it , restorative justice is at its heart a community-based process that seeks to honor the needs of those hurt and ensure accountability for those who caused them harm , instead of asking who broke the law and how they should be penalized .\n\u201c It can be difficult to come to the realization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished in order for you to heal , \u201d said Sonya Shah , a restorative justice practitioner who is also a sexual assault survivor .\nThe practitioners who spoke with me said restorative justice , which is inspired by the conflict-resolution practices of some Indigenous cultures , is most crucial for people in marginalized communities .\nThey are the ones who face disproportionate punishment in the justice system , not privileged white men ( or in Schneiderman \u2019 s case , a privileged white former law enforcement officer ) .\nBut some restorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a closer look at # MeToo .\nThey said they understood the valid anger the movement unleashed , but that harsher retribution wasn \u2019 t the answer .\nResearch has shown prison does not effectively rehabilitate offenders , and the criminal justice system can retraumatize and disempower survivors , who often say they want their assailant to change but not to be locked up .\nMost sexual assault and harassment claims are never even referred for prosecution \u2014 which is more evidence that other options are needed , experts said .\nFiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it doesn \u2019 t necessarily prevent them from getting another job where they hurt more people .\nPublic shaming can spread awareness , but on its own it provides no road map for ending the cycles of harm , experts said , especially since plenty of the most high-profile # MeToo men seem like they \u2019 re doing just fine and have no regrets other than getting called out .\nPractitioners said restorative justice doesn \u2019 t let offenders off easy \u2014 in order to participate in the process , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept responsibility \u2014 and that it always centers survivors \u2019 needs .\nIt also allows the parties to make progress even if they don \u2019 t agree on all of the facts .\nShah said she has counseled men who committed sexual assault who were willing to apologize for some but not all of what they were accused of , and she has worked with survivors who felt that a partial apology could still be beneficial .\n\u201c We come down so hard on people when they cause harm that they learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is to remain silent , defend themselves , and admit nothing , \u201d said Erika Sasson , a former litigator and long-standing restorative justice practitioner .\nThis fundamental right to a defense is important in court , she said , but it makes it harder for people to be honest with each other and break the silence and secrecy of abuse .\nTelling the truth , she said , takes \u201c courage , communication , and support.\n\u201d In April 2021 , the First Department appellate court issued its ruling : Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , conditioned upon continuing therapy and supervision .\nThe decision included a statement of facts that didn \u2019 t substantiate all of the claims against him , but Schneiderman admitted that he had slapped Selvaratnam and Manning Barish and placed his hands on their necks and applied pressure without first obtaining consent .\nHe also admitted to emotionally abusing them , and to slapping the anonymous woman from the Hamptons twice .\nThese avowals , however , were part of a legal settlement that didn \u2019 t seem to fully satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women learned that Schneiderman had tried to protect himself by blaming them .\nThe validation they expressed after his earlier statement of remorse was demolished .\n\u201c I initially chose not to participate in this after having to keep testifying over and over again , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted after the decision .\n\u201c But they went after Eric anyway , and he chose to compose a complete lie of a narrative to defend himself , and discredit me .\nSo I fought back.\n\u201d Schneiderman , she wrote , \u201c belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her book about Schneiderman at the time , and she spoke about how she believed in redemption if an abuser \u201c acknowledges the harm that they have committed and does the hard work to root out their abusive behavior.\n\u201d But the one-year suspension was \u201c not enough \u201d to reform Schneiderman , she said .\nThough they were not in contact , she was confident he hadn \u2019 t changed , because she had heard from other professed victims of his , including someone who said he abused her after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selvaratnam \u2019 s book , her evidence for that claim was an email she received from a woman who said Schneiderman was a \u201c sadist and predator \u201d who had \u201c targeted \u201d her .\nShe didn \u2019 t include more details .\nSelvaratnam acknowledged that she did not speak to the woman and couldn \u2019 t \u201c vouch for her experience.\n\u201d Still , the note felt like \u201c an affirmation.\n\u201d \u201c It also sparked the first time I felt rage toward Eric , \u201d she wrote .\nWhen I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allegation and said he hadn \u2019 t been romantically involved with a woman since May 2018 .\nHe said Selvaratnam didn \u2019 t reach out to him before publishing her book or before repeating the claim to the press .\nAfter the ruling , the anonymous Hamptons woman identified herself as Danya Perry , a prominent attorney who used to work for the Southern District of New York .\nPerry told me she was horrified and distraught when Schneiderman slapped her during a romantic encounter after a party , and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , she said , it seemed like Schneiderman had genuinely misread the situation .\nHe told her he had dated other women who enjoyed being slapped , and she believed him when he said he had made a drunken mistake .\nBut when Perry heard that journalists were looking into a possible pattern , she decided to tell them about her experience .\nShe wasn \u2019 t interested in prosecuting Schneiderman , and at first she didn \u2019 t want any role in the committee proceeding either .\nLosing his job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learned that he had defended himself by minimizing the fact that he slapped her and exaggerating her forgiveness .\n\u201c If he had acknowledged and apologized , I would have said , Why do we need to punish this guy anymore ?\n\u201d she told me .\nPerry decided to cooperate .\nI also reached out to Jess McIntosh , who in 2018 wrote an essay for Elle about going on an unsettling date with Schneiderman in the early 2000s .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what happens to Eric Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have any power over the women of New York anymore , \u201d McIntosh said .\n\u201c I very much care about taking away power from people who don \u2019 t treat women as human beings and are somehow surprised that acting physically violent is wrong.\n\u201d She was skeptical and unimpressed when I told her about his conversations with Hunter .\n\u201c I hope he stays woke , \u201d she said , \u201c and I hope he stays quiet.\n\u201d None of the women who spoke out in 2018 seemed satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists .\nThe criminal justice system couldn \u2019 t address his harm .\nThe committee decision didn \u2019 t appease them , and in some ways the process seemed to make matters worse .\nPublic awareness pushed Schneiderman out of power but hasn \u2019 t held him accountable for whatever he has or hasn \u2019 t done since .\nOver the last four years , post- # MeToo efforts toward systemic progress have delivered mixed results .\nLawmakers have introduced a wave of carceral bills that some experts say will do more harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed by # MeToo have been replaced by women in the workplace \u2014 for example , Letitia James holds Schneiderman \u2019 s former position \u2014 but many others have scored new jobs and been nominated for fancy awards .\nMeanwhile , Time \u2019 s Up , the prominent anti-harassment charity that was supposed to tackle structural # MeToo issues , fell into crisis because of its ties to Cuomo .\nThere has been scant funding or research to determine how restorative justice might address these issues on a larger scale , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act has a proposal set aside for restorative practices .\nAlthough it \u2019 s been nearly three years since Schneiderman said he knew his path forward included amends and restitution , he still has yet to directly apologize to Selvaratnam , Manning Barish , or Perry .\nAs for restitution , he said , he plans on asking them for their input at some point in the future .\nHe hasn \u2019 t yet donated any of his own money for that purpose \u2014 \u201c I \u2019 ve been unemployed for three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of prospects , \u201d he said \u2014 but he has donated millions to charity from his old campaign fund , which he can only legally withdraw from for a few purposes .\n( He also returned money to donors who asked for it back and used some to cover his legal fees . )\nSelvaratnam has written that she thought it wrong of him to launder his reputation with charitable donations , while Manning Barish recently posted online that she thought it was disgusting he hadn \u2019 t donated more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer for progressive causes .\nBefore his license was suspended , he reached out to a number of groups , but no one wanted to be publicly associated with him , he said , not even a nonprofit that works with formerly incarcerated people who have committed murder and rape .\nEventually he realized that if he swore never to disclose his participation \u2014 if he \u201c worked like a blacklisted screenwriter in the 1950s \u201d \u2014 he could do interesting and useful work , such as advising organizations on legal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soup kitchen through his synagogue .\nRabbi Matalon told me that egoless community service is an important part of repentance : \u201c Atonement requires humility.\n\u201d Schneiderman insisted that his journey is ongoing and that he has already made meaningful amends to some people in his life .\nHe repeatedly said that he still hopes to do so to the women who participated in the committee investigation , but he can \u2019 t consider it until he gets his law license back \u2014 which could take a while , since he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up \u2014 lest he seem to be interfering in the legal process , since there might a hearing where the women could be called to testify .\nThere \u2019 s another factor , too .\nHe wouldn \u2019 t speak about the details of his sobriety , but in many programs , such as Alcoholics Anonymous , making amends is a step that comes later on , after committing a \u201c searching and fearless moral inventory \u201d of oneself .\nBut neither reason explains why he agreed to give me the draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or why he wouldn \u2019 t reach out to Perry even after I shared what she told me about her willingness to engage .\nDoes he deserve more patience and support , or is he a lost cause who , despite all claims to the contrary , cares only about restoring his public image ?\nIn the absence of any formalized process that might thoroughly hold Schneiderman accountable , he \u2019 s decided to try his luck in the court of public opinion , leaving it up to the readers of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .\n\u201c I \u2019 m trying to do the next right thing every day , \u201d Schneiderman said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m still working on fully understanding the consequences of my conduct.\n\u201d He added , \u201c I \u2019 ve come to understand that the process I \u2019 m in now requires me to take some time before making certain amends , and I \u2019 m respecting that process and trying to do it the right way.\n\u201d Part of her is afraid to go public with their friendship because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s an enabler or betraying the movement .\nWhen I saw them both recently and asked Schneiderman to triple-confirm he would never run for office again , which he did , she quipped to him , \u201c If you did , I wouldn \u2019 t be your friend , \u201d and then followed up with me to say that she was serious and hoped I \u2019 d include that in the story : \u201c Running for office again would be the worst possible move for a recovering narcissist !\n\u201d There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .\n\u201c How do we make men care ?\n\u201d she asked me one day .\n\u201c Does a fear of being disgraced have to be part of the incentive ?\n\u201d But as long as Schneiderman keeps digging into his past and trying to make things right for the future \u2014 and as long as their exchanges continue to fascinate and challenge her \u2014 she \u2019 ll take walks and share meals with him , continuing their conversations about sex , power , and abuse .\nHunter always felt that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Schneiderman for her own benefit as much as for his .\nBut in August 2021 , Hunter read a New York magazine article about a form of restorative justice called \u201c surrogate dialogue \u201d in which survivors work through their trauma not with their own assailant but with someone else who committed similar offenses .\nHunter was shocked to realize that she and Schneiderman had , in their own unsupervised , extremely ad hoc way , been engaging in a version of that .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate that word , \u201d Hunter said .\n\u201c But having this extended conversation with Eric over three years where I have seen him deepen his own understanding and also deepen mine in a way , has \u2014 in the absence of any genuine reckoning or apology I \u2019 m going to get from any man who has hurt me \u2014 been the next best thing.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "While pandemic-related stress , anxiety , and grief due to the more than 900,000 COVID deaths in the US have had a well-documented impact on mental health , changes in daily life , like staying home for extended periods of time , can also affect other parts of your body , including your eyes , skin , and ability to focus .\nBuzzFeed News spoke to several doctors and experts about how spending more time at home can transform bodies in the short and long term .\nSpending more time indoors is known to increase the risk of nearsightedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in JAMA Ophthalmology suggested that during the pandemic , there were 1.4 to 3 times more cases of myopia in 2020 among children ages 6 to 8 than in the previous five years .\nThat wasn \u2019 t the case for kids ages 9 to 13 , who didn \u2019 t experience increases in myopia diagnoses .\nThe link is less studied in adults , but Dr. Mika Moy , an eye doctor and health sciences clinical professor at the University of California , Berkeley School of Optometry , said she isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients .\nHowever , close work ( spending hours reading or looking at something less than 20 centimeters , or about 7 to 8 inches distance from your face ) coupled with low light levels are thought to play a role in increased myopia risk .\n\u201c There 's other sort of generalizations , like people who live in cities tend to be more nearsighted than people who live in the country , and we think that 's because we 're finding there 's a protective connection with the outdoors , \u201d Moy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only eye-related problem that \u2019 s occurring during the pandemic .\nFor eyes , lockdowns in March 2020 were like having to \u201c run marathons without any training , \u201d Moy told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Your meetings are on the screen , your work is on the screen , and now everyone 's leisure time seems to also be on these screens.\n\u201d Often people forget to blink when staring at a screen for a long time , which deprives their eyes of moisturizing tears .\nWe \u2019 re also stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that secrete oil into our tears every time we blink .\nBlinking less can cause the glands to \u201c shrink away , \u201d Moy said , which isn \u2019 t good in the long run .\nEye drops called artificial tears can help relieve dryness , but they may not work as well as warm compresses .\nMoy suggests placing a warm washcloth over your eyes for 10 minutes about two times a day to feel relief .\nYou can also develop eye fatigue , which occurs when the muscles that control your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ; some people may get headaches or experience blurry vision as a result , Moy said .\nBlue light exposure is another factor to consider , which electronic devices emit .\nIt has one of the shorter yet higher energy wavelengths on the visible light spectrum , but experts agree there isn \u2019 t strong scientific evidence that shows it actually causes eye fatigue or damage .\n( Too much of it at night can make it harder for you to fall asleep , though , Moy said . )\nSo yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from staring at your computer all day , but the infamous blue light probably isn \u2019 t the culprit here .\nIn fact , the sun produces at least 100 times more blue light than a typical smartphone , the American Optometric Association says .\nThis means your fancy blue light glasses may not be doing much ; the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn \u2019 t recommend them .\nAnecdotally , however , Moy said her patients think they \u2019 re helpful ( personally , I think so , too , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne pair of glasses that might help are computer glasses , or \u201c occupational lenses , \u201d which are prescription frames that correct your vision specifically for computer-length distance , preventing your eyes from working too hard .\nThere are also some nonprescription reading glasses that are specifically made for computer work .\nOne of the best things you can do is give your eyes a break and try the 20-20-20 rule : every 20 minutes look 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds .\nOtherwise , take some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more ways than one .\nAlthough being indoors can protect you from sunburns and major risks of skin cancer from exposure to ultraviolet light , your vitamin D levels can drop because you \u2019 re not absorbing sunlight that helps your body produce it , notes Dr. Elizabeth Bahar Houshmand , a double board-certified dermatologist in Texas .\nVitamin D supports immune health , muscle function , brain activity , and the absorption of important minerals such as calcium , magnesium , and phosphate .\nStudies show vitamin D deficiency is associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone and muscle issues ( more on that later ) , and other health problems .\nA lack of sunlight exposure , darker skin , and older age increase your chances of having a deficiency .\nThe good news is that at least one 2021 study published in the European Journal of Public Health found that vitamin D deficiency was no more common in patients in Italy during 2020 lockdowns compared with previous years , suggesting it may not always be an issue for those of us spending extra time at home during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of sun exposure is necessary for your body to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D. Stepping outside for \u201c a few minutes a day is enough , \u201d Dr. Joshua Zeichner , director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , told BuzzFeed News .\nYou can also get your vitamin D from fortified foods , supplements , and certain foods like salmon and egg yolks .\nWhat both dermatologists have noticed during the pandemic is more patients coming in with rashes , acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes facial redness and pimplelike bumps on the skin .\nZeichner blames face masks , stress , and poor eating habits ( namely , eating too much sugar ) .\nSugar can promote inflammation in the body and drive oil production that can lead to acne breakouts , he said .\nOver time , excess sugar can trigger glycation \u2014 when sugar molecules attach to proteins in your skin called collagen \u2014 which can contribute to wrinkles , he said .\nRegular exercise can help .\nIt keeps your skin cells functioning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeichner said .\n\u201c The days may seem long and repetitive , but keep up with your skincare routine , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What you do now certainly will have an impact on your skin in the future.\n\u201d Then there \u2019 s a less obvious but still insidious impact on your body ( and mind ) .\nPeople are spending more time in Zoom meetings where staring at themselves in the harsh glare of a computer is making them more self-conscious about the way they look .\nBoth dermatologists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get rid of dark spots , wrinkles , and undereye bags .\nZeichner recommends wearing sunscreen , even indoors because harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can still pierce through windows and penetrate your skin .\nVarious stress-inducing pollutants also exist inside your home , Houshmand said , especially in the winter when central heating and lack of fresh air can dry your skin ; she recommends setting up a humidifier in your home to help .\nIf you \u2019 re anything like Michel , the 23-year-old with back trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains associated with turning your home into a workspace .\nDr. Charla Fischer , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News she \u2019 s seeing more patients come in with back pain related to poor posture while working from home .\n\u201c We sit in a bad position all day , hunched over a laptop , and the muscles get overstretched and microtears develop .\nThen the muscle starts to cramp because of this injury , and we get pain , \u201d Fischer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just an achy back .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c as dangerous for your health as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day , \u201d Dr. Nicholas DiNubile , an orthopedic surgeon at Premier Orthopedics And Sports Medicine in Pennsylvania and American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons spokesperson , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c We already have a big problem in our nation with this , and the pandemic only made it worse.\n\u201d Add inactivity with a lack of vitamin D and you have a \u201c real issue , \u201d DiNubile said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone health , but also muscle injuries , and tears are more common when levels are low.\n\u201d Kids , for example , are getting more injuries now that they \u2019 re returning to physical activities after about two years of home confinement .\n\u201c Never in my entire career have I gone two weeks without seeing an ACL injury , \u201d DiNubile said , yet at the beginning of the pandemic , about five months passed with no injured kid in sight .\n\u201c Now it \u2019 s payback .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being sedentary could lead to loss of muscle , too , which could slow metabolism and contribute to weight gain and obesity , he added .\nAnd over two-plus years , osteoporosis , or bone thinning , could become an issue , which is particularly worrisome for white and Asian women , postmenopausal women , and teenagers ( given bone health is built in teen years ) , DiNubile said .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important to make sure your home is equipped to support your body as best as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ergonomically appropriate equipment , like a monitor , adjustable office chair , keyboard , computer mouse , and proper back support .\nYou should set your monitor at eye level , keyboard at lap level , and both knees at a 90-degree angle , Fischer suggests , and incorporate standing breaks , short walks , and stretching into your daily routine to prevent future pain .\nSeating arrangements without cushions and solid back support will allow your body to slouch and form a \u201c C \u201d curve , said Fischer , who \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dining chair instead ( you can buy lumbar support pillows that fit any chair ) , and only use your bed for sleeping , she said .\n\u201c Mattresses are not designed for us to sit and do work on them.\n\u201d Our brains are incredibly adaptive , constantly adjusting to their surroundings .\nBut for some , shifting workplaces and social situations can have some surprising and unexpected impacts on daily life .\nJohn Redding , 46 , of Texas , said his inability to focus even for short periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor nuisance to a major issue , \u201d even with the help of medication .\n\u201c I used to be a voracious reader , but I have n't read an entire book since the pandemic started.\n\u201d Sam Ling , an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University , told BuzzFeed News some people may be less productive at home because there are more distractions there .\nHowever , that \u2019 s not the case for everyone .\nSereena Millward , 28 , told us she struggles to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office again .\n\u201c The sounds of people talking and eating at their desk grate on me , but I also can \u2019 t concentrate if it \u2019 s deadly silent.\n\u201d ( This feeling is called misophonia . )\nThat \u2019 s because a shift in how people interact from in person to online \u2014 and then back again \u2014 can be a bit of adjustment .\n\u201c There \u2019 s exhaustion that \u2019 s involved in monitoring social cues when there \u2019 s so little information available , \u201d Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimuli overload when we return to face-to-face interactions that may be overwhelming for some .\nLing noted that retraining our brains to socialize as we used to could take some time .\nThe brain is a muscle ; the parts we don \u2019 t exercise regularly will get a little wonky .\n\u201c COVID has promoted this hermitlike life , \u201d he said , although he doesn \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve permanently rewired our \u201c pretty plastic \u201d brains to solely tolerate the comfort of our homes .\n\u201c On so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest experiments that has ever been done on the human brain.\n\u201d Pandemic home life has been a blessing in disguise for some people .\nIt helped Abby Adesanya , 29 , experience a specific ( and pleasurable ) bodily sensation for the first time in April 2020 as she was listening to Dua Lipa \u2019 s Future Nostalgia album alone in her New York apartment .\n\u201c I was blasting the album , throwing my hands in the air , wishing I could be dancing in the clubs to this .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders start to vibrate , and it spread down my arms.\n\u201d Adesanya was experiencing frisson : the chills and goosebumps often felt after listening to music or watching something in synchrony .\nAnywhere between 55 % to 86 % of people experience frisson , yet Adesanya had never felt it .\n\u201c I can not believe my body suddenly just unlocked this ability .\nI do n't know if it was trying to fill in the blanks for missing stimuli .\nBut the fact it 's here is so cool , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really dark time.\n\u201d Ling said he isn \u2019 t surprised by Adesanya \u2019 s breakthrough .\nIt \u2019 s possible when going from a hyperstimulated environment such as life in New York City to a quiet apartment that the reduction in stimuli helped unbusy her mind .\nIt \u2019 s what meditation does for many people , he said .\nAnother body part that might have suffered during the pandemic is your teeth .\nThe cost and need for insurance normally prevents many people from going to the dentist , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dental work , added another barrier to routine checkups .\nKelly Holst , an assistant professor at Temple University \u2019 s Kornberg School of Dentistry in Pennsylvania , told BuzzFeed News this worsened dental problems for many people .\n\u201c There 's only so much you can do at home .\nYou can \u2019 t scrape off the plaque , food debris , and bacteria that harden and calcify on your teeth \u201d without a dentists \u2019 help , said Holst , who also noticed an uptick in patients with preexisting dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse boat.\n\u201d Pandemic-related stress and missed appointments have left some people with jaw pain associated with teeth grinding , too , she added .\nExtra time at home also means more , often unnecessary , snacking , which is \u201c notoriously bad for your oral health \u201d and clears the way for cavities to form , Holst said .\n\u201c At work , you 're sort of more regimented with your food intake .\nAt home , you kind of have that freedom to graze.\n\u201d Certain acidic foods and drinks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sports drinks , soda , and alcohol ) can contribute to demineralization in your enamel \u2014 the outer layer of your teeth and strongest tissue in your body \u2014 and make your mouth more acidic by throwing off your oral pH level , Holst said .\nDon \u2019 t want to put down the snacks ?\nHolst suggests you eat or drink them right away and avoid nibbling or sipping throughout the day .\nThat way you give your mouth time to naturally recalibrate itself .\nOtherwise , use fluoride toothpaste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine cleanings , and use an electric toothbrush , she said .\nSeveral people we spoke to said their body size experienced the most change during the pandemic .\nSome people lost weight , others gained .\nPatr\u00edcia Romano , 26 , used to struggle to gain weight ( she blames genetics and stress ) , but when her job became remote in 2020 , she stopped walking to and from work and gained 11 pounds .\nInstead of skipping lunch and dinner on the regular , she started eating more homemade meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to .\nBut the weight gain was rough for Romano , who \u2019 s a lawyer in Brazil .\nShe became obsessed with analyzing her body in the mirror and noticing flaws that many others likely couldn \u2019 t notice .\nIt got so bad that Romano took regular pregnancy tests because she would \u201c see a huge stomach , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c Now that some time has passed , it does n't bother me as much anymore , \u201d Romano said .\n\u201c I gave up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing it as this new body that has endured the delicate time of a worldwide stressful situation.\n\u201d Heidi ( who didn \u2019 t feel comfortable sharing her last name ) told us she got so tired of cooking for herself at home that she \u201c ended up eating less and losing a bunch of weight , which triggered some weird fatigue issues that were made worse with pandemic burnout and work-from-home/isolation.\n\u201d In general , you shouldn \u2019 t feel bad about weight changes during the pandemic .\nWe \u2019 ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nOne part of your body may have been particularly sensitive to all the changes related to your diet , mental health , and activity levels during the pandemic \u2014 your gastrointestinal tract .\nDr. Sarah McGill , an associate professor of medicine specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , told BuzzFeed News many patients say added stress and loneliness during the pandemic has led to an increase in abdominal pain , diarrhea , and nausea .\n\u201c The GI tract has even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we feel can cause GI distress , \u201d McGill said .\nWhat \u2019 s more , people increased their drinking during the pandemic , which isn \u2019 t a positive trend given alcohol is directly toxic to your GI tract , can cause fat to accumulate in your liver , and contribute to liver damage , McGill said .\nA Johns Hopkins survey of 832 adults over 21 found 60 % reported increased drinking in May 2020 compared to pre-COVID times and 34 % reported binge drinking .\nStress , alcohol availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers for increased drinking .\nFor Beth Boardman , 61 , a writer and retired nurse in California , regular afternoon wine on an empty stomach led her to develop acute gastritis and esophagitis , or inflammation of the lining of the stomach and esophagus .\nMcGill said you should avoid alcohol as much as you can , and exercise regularly , which will keep your bowel movements flowing as they should , help you maintain a stable weight , and keep your heart healthy .\nSpeaking of bowel movements , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending more time at home .\nWhile some people may have experienced more constipation from a suddenly sedentary lifestyle , others may have seen an improvement from an increased ability to listen to body cues \u2014 and easier access to a bathroom .\nHolding back bowel movements \u2014 for example , because you \u2019 re commuting or working in a busy office \u2014 can make constipation more likely , McGill said .\nSo , it \u2019 s safe to say spending more time at home may have made going to the bathroom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced diet consisting of fruits , vegetables , and fiber-rich whole grains is important to keep things running smoothly , whether you are spending time at home or more time out of the house .\n\u201c Fiber directly contributes to gut health by feeding the trillions of microorganisms we have there , which in turn help us with our mood , metabolism , and lots of other aspects of health , \u201d McGill

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nCondoms get a bad rap .\nDespite

most people would agree that the trend isn \u2019 t a positive one .\nCDC data suggest that STI rates hit an all-time high in 2019 for the sixth consecutive year in a row .\nOne of the reasons people may not be that into condoms is they are using the wrong type or size .\nYes , fit matters !\n( When was a one-size-fits-all approach ever a good idea for anything ? )\nIf a condom is too small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn the other hand , if it \u2019 s too large , there could be spillage or it may simply fall off .\nAccording to Melissa White , founder and CEO of fit-focused condom purveyor Lucky Bloke , only about 50 % of people with penises should be wearing a medium or standard-fit condom , which is about 90 % of what you \u2019 ll see on the shelves in conventional retail stores .\nAnother 30 % to 35 % require a snugger , more secure fit , and the remaining 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger size or Magnum condom .\nAnd no , condom size is not actually related to length , so put away your ruler or measuring tape .\nInstead , grab an empty toilet paper roll and measure for girth ( if it fits nicely in there , you \u2019 re likely a standard fit ; too tight and you should go larger , too much space and you should go smaller ) .\nThough it may be tempting for people with penises to grab a box of Magnums more as a status symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise against using condoms that are too big .\nPeople probably aren \u2019 t talking enough about condoms All too often sex education in general is a fail in the US , and that can certainly apply to knowledge about condoms , said Ashley Townes , a postdoctoral research associate at the CDC who focuses on sexual health .\nA stigma against buying the correct size condom may be particularly pervasive in teenage boys who simply don \u2019 t know any better .\nTownes , who is a former sex educator , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they need to know about choosing and using the right condom .\n\u201c You get one lesson to talk about contraceptives , and condoms are only a sliver of all the different contraceptives available , \u201d she said .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t have a lot of time to dive into it , so it can be challenging even as an educator to really go in depth about , How do you choose one that fits ?\nHow do you choose one that feels good for you ?\n\u201d And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about condom use is more than some people get , including those at schools where sex ed isn \u2019 t covered at all .\n\u201c Sex education isn \u2019 t mandatory across the United States , \u201d said \u00c9va Goicochea , founder of sexual wellness company Maude .\n\u201c Even if it is , it 's not always medically accurate , and so what ends up happening is that when they 're teaching about condoms , often they \u2019 re not able to open them in the classroom , so it 's harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Condom use has fallen out of the conversation a bit as focus has shifted to consent and sexual assault prevention , social demographer Laura Lindberg said .\n\u201c What we see in sex education and health education more generally is as certain topics rise in importance , there \u2019 s less space and time to talk about other things that used to be discussed because nobody 's expanding the amount of time , \u201d she said .\nA 2021 study in the Journal of Adolescent Health of 2,291 college students found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about consent than condom use or STI prevention .\n\u201c In my era , I was literally the first group who was getting the , Here \u2019 s a banana .\nHere \u2019 s a condom .\nThis is important because everyone around you could have HIV , \u201d Lindberg said .\n\u201c Now the first talk you get your freshman week on a college campus is about consent .\nBut they \u2019 re not doing two talks , so you don \u2019 t get space to talk about condoms.\n\u201d Finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perk of wearing a properly fitting condom is that it \u2019 s also going to feel better , likely for both partners .\n\u201c A common response we get is that using a condom will interfere with your pleasure , \u201d said Lindberg , who is also a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute , referring to the answers they get on their surveys .\n\u201c I think we need to be honest that it may interfere with people \u2019 s sexual pleasure , and here are steps you can take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right fit , Lindberg had one main piece of advice when it comes to making sex with condoms feel better : \u201c Lubricate , lubricate , lubricate.\n\u201d Townes agreed , noting that people often don \u2019 t want to use lubricant even though it can increase pleasure and reduce the feeling of the condom itself .\nWhite added that using lubricant also makes the condom more effective from a safety perspective .\n\u201c Latex condoms in particular are naturally drying , \u201d White said .\n\u201c So your receiving partner is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes the condom less safe.\n\u201d White recommends putting a few drops inside the condom and a generous amount on the outside to help both parties feel more pleasure and reduce friction to maximize safety .\nTownes also recommended trying compatible sex toys with your condom to spice things up , like a vibrating cock ring or an external vibrator that won \u2019 t interfere with the effectiveness of the condom .\nPeople are still using condoms , just not often enough Despite the fact that there \u2019 s less consistency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , Lindberg feels it \u2019 s important to recognize how far we \u2019 ve come in making condoms more socially acceptable .\nHer research shows that condom use at first intercourse has gone up dramatically , and 9 out of 10 sexually active teenagers have used a condom at some point .\n\u201c There aren \u2019 t declines in contraceptive use overall , \u201d Lindberg said .\n\u201c So young people are replacing condom use with other methods of contraception , and I think that speaks to the increased availability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pill.\n\u201d As great as it is that there are so many other contraceptive methods available , only condoms can protect against both STIs and pregnancy .\nDepending on your access to healthcare , condoms may also be easier to get since they don \u2019 t require a prescription and are relatively inexpensive .\nThat can be particularly appealing if you \u2019 re not having consistent sex and don \u2019 t want to be on a contraceptive all the time .\nAnd on a very basic level , they make sex less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Lindberg assured that the best way for a condom to fail is to not use it .\n( In truth , condoms are 98 % effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly . )\nIf you find you have barriers to buying condoms IRL , such as a fear of judgmental drugstore clerks or running into your old English teacher , this guide should help .\nAll of these condoms are available online for an embarrassment-free buying experience .",

        "content": "At the heart of Palin \u2019 s lawsuit against the Times and former opinion editor James Bennet , is an editorial the newspaper ran on June 14 , 2017 , some 12 hours after a Bernie Sanders supporter opened fire on a group of Republican congressmen practicing at a Virginia baseball field , wounding Rep. Steve Scalise .\nThe editorial compared that shooting to the 2011 one in Arizona , which had seriously injured Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others .\n\u201c The link to political incitement was clear , \u201d read the language Bennet added to the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arizona shooting and a 2010 map produced by Palin \u2019 s PAC that featured gun crosshairs over the districts of Democrats like Giffords who had voted for Obamacare and were up for reelection in competitive races .\nBut , as critics of the paper soon pointed out after the editorial ran online that night , there was no established link between that map and the gunman in the Giffords shooting , who had a mental illness .\nIn his testimony on Wednesday , Bennet told the court he had inartfully expressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated political rhetoric in the runup to the Giffords shooting .\nOnly the gunman and his \u201c derangement \u201d were to blame for the attack , Bennet said , but the Palin PAC map was still indirectly connected to the incident because it expressly named and targeted Giffords .\n`` I \u2019 ve regretted this pretty much every day since I meant it was simply a connection to this larger environment , \u201d Bennet said Wednesday of his original choice of words .\n\u201c If I thought it caused the violence , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused.\n\u2019 It would have saved me a couple of words.\n\u201d The crosshairs map was criticized for its gun imagery when it was first published by Palin \u2019 s PAC and then again in the wake of the Giffords shooting .\nPalin told the court on Thursday she found those criticisms at the time to be \u201c mortifying \u201d and untruthful .\nThe Arizona shooting had particularly horrified her , she said , because one of the victims , 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green , was roughly the same age as Palin \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she conceded , could be viewed as being crosshairs , but could also be seen as \u201c emojis , \u201d \u201c surveyor \u2019 s markers , \u201d or \u201c bullseyes , \u201d she argued .\nIt was not , she said , urging violence .\n\u201c I took issue with the interpretation that anybody would have that it was some kind of call to violence , \u201d Palin said .\nWhen the Times referenced the map in its 2017 editorial , Palin said she felt the newspaper was politicizing a tragedy .\nEarlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview to the conservative website Breitbart ( which she then reposted to her own website ) warning the media and others against blaming Sanders for the actions of his supporter .\nNow , she said , the Times had done just that .\n\u201c The New York Times \u2014 the be all and end all , the loud voice in media \u2014 had already taken that knee jerk reaction and I felt was trying to score political points , \u201d she said .\nIn a confusing moment of testimony , Palin contended this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had printed the false assertion .\nWhen the Times attorneys objected , Judge Jed Rakoff felt compelled to intervene , asking Palin whether she was saying the newspaper had printed this falsehood before .\n\u201c Precisely , \u201d she said , accusing them of having \u201c led the charge \u201d in trying to connect the map and the Arizona shooting before the 2017 attack .\nBut in a moment that recalled the vague answers she famously gave to journalist Katie Couric in 2008 about what newspapers she read , Palin was again unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre testimony prompted an almost 20-minute break wherein the judge and opposing counsel conferred in a separate room , while Palin sat quietly in the witness box before the jury .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There was a burst of energy in the Senate last month to block future attempts to overturn electoral college votes and steal a presidential election .\nBut that momentum has stalled and no bill is expected anytime soon .\nA bipartisan group of senators has been negotiating how to prevent a vice president from overturning election results during the electoral college count .\nFormer president Donald Trump and his allies hoped to exploit legal ambiguities in January 2021 to overturn his loss to Joe Biden .\nThat plan ultimately went nowhere as then\u2013vice president Mike Pence and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot .\nAfter the Democrats failed to get enough votes to pass their voting rights bill last month , talks quickly began on a bipartisan bill to fix the process of certifying elections .\nBut early enthusiasm around finding bipartisan agreement to change election laws has now settled into a long slog of figuring out how to actually do it .\nThe timeline is now being talked about in terms of months or even years .\n\u201c Oh , it \u2019 s a long way to go , \u201d said Sen. Mitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c But it doesn \u2019 t get called into question until 2024 so we have plenty of time to work on it.\n\u201d Bipartisan efforts often collapse because of politics , but both sides are indicating that is not the case here .\nThe will is there , they say .\nThe problem is how complicated the issue is .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve still got a lot of research to do .\nIt \u2019 s a lot of work .\nWe \u2019 re meeting regularly , we \u2019 re talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut it \u2019 s a ways to go , \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins , who is leading the Republican side .\nSenators are looking to amend the Electoral Count Act , a 135-year-old arcane and often confusing document that lays out how election disputes are settled .\nThe law states that the sitting vice president will preside over the Senate when it counts electoral college votes on Jan. 6 .\nTraditionally , this role has been ceremonial .\nBut Trump argued \u2014 and continues to argue \u2014 that the vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reject electors sent by the states .\nThere seems to be clearly enough support across both parties to amend the law to clarify that the vice president \u2019 s role is only symbolic .\nEven Sen. Ron Johnson , a Republican who frequently repeated unverified claims about voter fraud , told BuzzFeed News he supports such a measure .\nThe problem is what else gets included .\nPoliticians are trying to balance the powers , responsibilities , and limitations of three separate entities in a way that will avoid a constitutional crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the states , which are in charge of running elections , certifying the results , and sending slates of electors to Congress .\nThese electors , making up the electoral college , ultimately select the next president .\nYou have Congress , whose role is to certify and count those electors .\nThen you have the courts , which have been regularly brought in to moderate disputes in recent history , but which could be overruled by Congress .\nLet \u2019 s say a state elects one party locally , but votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a presidential election .\nWhat happens if the state government overturns those results , citing \u201c fraud \u201d or \u201c irregularities , \u201d and sends a slate of electors that supports their candidate ?\nCan Congress overrule a state legislature ?\n\u201c It depends , \u201d said Republican Sen. Todd Young , one senator involved in talks .\nAppearing to realize this wasn \u2019 t the most reassuring answer , Young added , \u201c Sorry , but it \u2019 s true , though.\n\u201d Trump has spent the last weeks railing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any Republican supportive of the process .\n\u201c The reason they want it changed is because they now say they don \u2019 t want the Vice President to have the right to ensure an honest vote , \u201d he said in a statement on Feb. 4 .\n\u201c In other words , I was right and everyone knows it.\n\u201d Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said that the reform bill , whenever it gets written , is expected to go through regular order .\nThat means going before the Senate Rules Committee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo one involved is giving a timeline for when even the first stage could be complete .\n\u201c A lot of discussion , research going on , \u201d said Angus King , the lead Democrat on the bipartisan talks .",

Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) told Politico ahead of the vote .\n\u201c I \u2019 m quite an arbitration supporter , but in this particular instance , I think that it \u2019 s easy to cover up sexual harassment , sexual assault .\n\u2026 And women \u2019 s issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ought to be.\n\u201d The issue has attracted Republican support in part due to the advocacy of former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson , who filed a lawsuit against former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes in 2016 .\n\u201c We would have sued Fox News instead of only suing Roger Ailes , \u201d Carlson told the New York Times about how forced arbitration affected her case .\n\u201c I did not understand the ramifications of that clause .\nTons of people have no idea they have the clauses.\n\u201d The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , in part to attract Republican support , including focusing specifically on sexual assault and harassment , rather than other employment issues , including discrimination .\nBut some supporters , including Sen. Elizabeth Warren , hope it \u2019 s a first step toward eliminating mandatory arbitration across the board .\n\u201c I have wanted to get rid of mandatory arbitration and all consumer contracts for well over a decade , \u201d she told Politico .\n\u201c We \u2019 re getting action right now because it \u2019 s focused on sexual assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration is a way for giant corporations to squeeze consumers and make sure that they don \u2019 t have access to the courts , to exercise their legal rights .\n\u201d",

        "content": "When New York \u2019 s attorney general was accused of abusing women , one friend decided that instead of cutting him out of her life , she would try to make him reckon with the harm he inflicted .\nThe experiment they undertook underscores the tantalizing promise \u2014 and the painful limitations \u2014 of moral redemption for men outed by # MeToo .\nEric Schneiderman paced around his prewar Upper West Side apartment in what he would later call a \u201c crazed bunker mentality , \u201d trying to make sense of the past few days .\nAs New York \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero to liberals nationwide for his leading role in the anti-Trump resistance .\nThat changed when the New Yorker reported that multiple women had accused him of physical and emotional abuse .\nWithin hours , Schneiderman learned his longtime rival , then-governor Andrew Cuomo , had ordered a criminal investigation , after which Schneiderman felt compelled to resign .\nSince then he had cloistered himself inside , taking covert house calls from his psychiatrist and hiding from the reporters who camped out in lawn chairs on the street below .\nHis lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements , but privately he obsessed over the injustices he felt he had suffered , from the article , which he thought was unfair , to the political allies who had hastily abandoned him .\nAs Schneiderman stewed in denial and resentment , he got a message from a friend , Anna Graham Hunter , that shook him out of his bitter reverie .\nOn May 7 , 2018 , the day Schneiderman \u2019 s life changed forever , Hunter was sitting at her computer , wrapping up an article for the Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence-breakers \u201d were struggling after coming forward .\nShe was one of them .\n\u201c Why have I been so angry ?\n\u201d she wrote .\n\u201c Shouldn \u2019 t I be feeling better now that my story is out there ?\n\u201d He wasn \u2019 t the only one .\nThroughout her life Hunter had had a variety of upsetting experiences with men , some of which she now categorized as sexual assault .\nOther women could commiserate with her , but it usually concluded with \u201c men are trash , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorphin hit of self-righteousness , those aren \u2019 t fun thoughts to have , and I don \u2019 t know that they ultimately lead to lasting change.\n\u201d Therapists only wanted to talk about childhood trauma , and other men she knew were too defensive to engage .\nHunter wanted to know why all these guys were the way they were .\nShe craved thornier conversations around abuse , sex , and power , but so far she hadn \u2019 t been able to find anyone who wanted to wade into what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Schneiderman would go there with her .\nHunter believed the women who had accused Schneiderman , and she felt deeply conflicted about reaching out to the man who hurt them , but perhaps , she told herself , their dialogue could serve a larger purpose .\nShe figured she couldn \u2019 t be the only one with questions that # MeToo had not been able to resolve \u2014 questions that felt necessary to explore if the movement was to lead to enduring cultural transformation .\nHunter certainly didn \u2019 t think abusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims had any obligation to them whatsoever .\nBut she did wonder if it was ever possible for someone who was capable of such terrible acts to change .\nIt was impossible to know , since almost none of the prominent men outed by # MeToo appeared to have seriously tried .\nWhat would a genuine apology sound like ?\nWhat would constitute true remorse ?\nWas rehabilitation a realistic goal , and , if so , what would that process entail ?\n\u201c Right now I care about the feelings of everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about your feelings , \u201d Hunter wrote to Schneiderman four days later .\n\u201c You have no idea how this has gutted so many , many people , people that I care about and love .\nNo idea .\nThis is by far the worst # MeToo story to come out in many ways.\n\u201d She laid into him for what she saw as sexual entitlement and publicly masked misogyny : \u201c You have some serious fucking reckoning to do.\n\u201d \u201c I will continue to have many ups and downs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote .\n\u201c You 're still my friend , and I still love you , but I am not going to be an easy shoulder for you.\n\u201d \u201c I had to sleep on this one , \u201d Schneiderman wrote Hunter back the next day .\n\u201c I accept the hard shoulder role you are uniquely qualified to play , but it may take a little time before I can fully lean into this conversation .\nYou may not care about my feelings , but I am still reeling from the multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mental state is pretty fragile right now .\nAlthough I go way up and way down .\nI know the path forward includes taking full responsibility for everything I have done , but I am only capable of taking things day by day right now .\nI hope you can understand that , even if you think less of me because of it .\nHaving said all that , this conversation is very important to me .\nI hope we can take it up again when I am better equipped to engage.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ had over the next three and a half years \u2014 on the phone , in emails , over meals , and during long walks through Manhattan \u2019 s Riverside Park \u2014 were at times revelatory .\nThey helped Hunter better understand the harm men had done to her and how it had shaped her .\nAnd they helped Schneiderman understand that he did not deserve to hold a position of power again .\nIt took Hunter a few days to contact him .\n\u201c I went around in torturous loops , \u201d she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any point in spending my energy talking to Eric when I could be supporting women instead.\n\u201d Schneiderman \u2019 s press team had advance notice that the New Yorker was investigating his relationships , but he had told them not to worry \u2014 back then he was so \u201c oblivious , \u201d he said , that he didn \u2019 t feel his personal life would interest a journalist .\nHe knew he had problems : alcoholism , workaholism , maybe even narcissism .\nBut although as attorney general he had pursued high-profile # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see a connection between what he felt were simply personal shortcomings and the crimes he was accused of .\nHe had never interrogated why he enjoyed what he then thought of as \u201c rough sex , \u201d he said .\nThe way he saw it , some of the women he dated were into choking , slapping , and dark role-play , and some weren \u2019 t .\nIn his mind , he tested their boundaries , but he didn \u2019 t force anyone who told him to stop , which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe had other exes who backed that up .\nOne former girlfriend , Lorna Brett , who dated Schneiderman between Manning Barish and Selvaratnam , told me that in her experience he clearly understood that \u201c no means no.\n\u201d His ex-wife , Jennifer Cunningham , issued a statement at the time saying she didn \u2019 t believe the allegations , which were \u201c completely inconsistent \u201d with the man she had known for 35 years .\nThe New Yorker gave Schneiderman three and a half hours to respond to the claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy of intimate relationships , \u201d he said in a statement , \u201c I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity .\nI have not assaulted anyone .\nI have never engaged in nonconsensual sex , which is a line I would not cross.\n\u201d He also denied ever threatening to kill anyone .\nWhen Schneiderman \u2019 s attorneys were preparing him for the criminal investigation Cuomo ordered , they recovered messages that they believed showed the women had not just consented but pursued relationships with him after the alleged abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have the opportunity to show the New Yorker this evidence .\nHe was eager to tell Hunter about the other ex-partners who still supported him and the holes he saw in the story , using what she called his \u201c politician voice.\n\u201d \u201c He wanted me on his side , and he considered being on his side believing that he was wronged , \u201d Hunter said .\nThose early conversations were maddening for her , and she often raged at him .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what you didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him .\n\u201c I care what you did do.\n\u201d Despite his bitterness , Schneiderman said , he didn \u2019 t want to follow in the footsteps of the many other famous men who refused to resign from their jobs or otherwise accept any responsibility after being called out .\nNor did he want to take refuge in one of the numerous safe spaces , from men \u2019 s rights forums to right-wing podcasts , for resentful men who want to nurse their grievances about # MeToo .\nHunter had told Schneiderman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his therapist but impossible to deal with after a meeting with his lawyers .\nSo he devised a code word , \u201c criminal defense loop , \u201d that Hunter could wield whenever Schneiderman started arguing his case , after which they would move on to more productive ground .\nOver those first six months , Schneiderman completed an in-patient alcohol rehabilitation program , committed to sobriety , and started weekly therapy .\nHe had always been drawn to meditation , and he revived his practice and Dharma study , which allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It helped me to be in my body , to get out of my jabbering mind , and to really be able to identify difficult feelings , and instead of running away from them , be able to sit with them , \u201d he said .\nDuring our interviews , he sometimes fingered the 108 Buddhist mala beads he wears on his wrist to remind him \u201c to breathe.\n\u201d He and Hunter also started a \u201c feminist book club , \u201d discussing challenging work by writers from New York magazine \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Wilber .\nThey read Moira Donegan on why she started the \u201c Shitty Media Men \u201d list and Tarana Burke on # MeToo \u2019 s origin story .\nThey cast a wide net , covering the Black women left out of the suffrage movement , sexual abuse in the Catholic Church , and research on false memories .\nBy approaching these topics intellectually , Schneiderman began to understand \u201c the scope of misogyny and sexism and patriarchy , how it permeated my life , how it permeated our culture , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to apply what he was learning to himself .\nIn September , four months after Schneiderman resigned , millions of Americans watched as Christine Blasey Ford testified that she had been sexually assaulted by prospective Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when they were both in high school .\nAs they continued their wide-ranging discussions , Hunter , on edge from the hearings , started to feel that Schneiderman was showing more interest in the possibilities for abusers \u2019 redemption than in victims \u2019 pain .\n\u201c I know that the hardest part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think what I think , \u201d she wrote him in an email .\n\u201c And you want me to understand your experience .\nBut for fuck 's sake , it 's been all about men and their pain and anger for centuries .\nI 'm over it .\nEvery woman I know is over it.\n\u201d \u201c I appreciate your honesty , but what you seem to be saying is that right now you can \u2019 t muster up much in the way of compassion for men , \u201d Schneiderman wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nDoes that feel ok ?\nIt sounds like for you it does .\nBut in my experience , you can \u2019 t hear or see someone you have no compassion for , which probably makes any meaningful dialogue impossible.\n\u201d \u201c To have you ask how I feel about not having compassion for men ... just wow , \u201d Hunter wrote back .\n\u201c You may not want to talk to me right now .\nBut what I may have meant is I don \u2019 t want to talk to you.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exhausted by how \u201c the public credibility \u201d of the # MeToo movement \u201c seems to rest on individual stories.\n\u201d The \u201c constant cross examination of every woman \u2019 s account \u201d made it difficult for her to be interested in the nuances of Schneiderman \u2019 s own experiences or care at all about the feelings of men in his position .\n\u201c I \u2019 m terrified that one tiny chink will make the whole thing come tumbling down , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c The Kavanaugh hearings felt like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026 I don \u2019 t think you understand the collective experience of women who \u2019 ve been abused by men and had our experiences be invisible for our entire lives until a year ago .\nHow could you ?\n\u201d Schneiderman replied , thanking Hunter for her honesty and conceding that he had been ignoring that collective experience : \u201c Looking at women \u2019 s stories as the tales of individuals with agency ( and who must take responsibility for their own roles in any situation ) misses the overwhelming , crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every situation.\n\u201d At first , Schneiderman felt disgusted by Kavanaugh , who struck him as \u201c the big WASP-y jock \u201d who would have bullied him in school .\nBut in therapy , he had been unpacking his upbringing \u2014 private school in Manhattan , followed by Amherst and Harvard \u2014 and his relationships with his mother and his father , who , like Schneiderman , was a powerful attorney and a \u201c functional alcoholic.\n\u201d When he later read an essay on Kavanaugh \u2019 s privilege , the similarities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharper focus .\nThey both had \u201c benefitted from the American patriarchal structure , \u201d Schneiderman said , and were both brought up to think they could \u201c make the rules and therefore break the rules and prosper.\n\u201d When I asked Hunter why she kept speaking to Schneiderman even when he upset her , she cited dialogues like the one above .\nShe was intrigued by his willingness to be honest with himself \u2014 even if it was a slow and difficult process \u2014 and to keep reading what made him uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cathartic .\n\u201c I felt like so much of the # MeToo conversation was just women talking to other women and talking about what we wanted to say to men who had done bad things , and now I could actually say it to his face and he had to listen to every word , \u201d Hunter said .\nMeanwhile , Manning Barish and Selvaratnam were writing through their trauma \u2014 Manning Barish on social media , Selvaratnam for the New York Times .\nSelvaratnam began working on a memoir about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrast between Schneiderman \u2019 s actions and his do-gooder persona .\n\u201c His outward-facing spirituality was a mask for the torment beneath the surface , \u201d she later wrote .\n\u201c His outward-facing feminism was a mask for his misogyny.\n\u201d Hunter and Schneiderman were exploring similar themes together .\nWhen they read \u201c The Rub of Rough Sex \u201d by Chelsea Summers \u2014 an essay that focused on Schneiderman himself and considered how progressive men have used \u201c kink as a cover for abuse \u201d \u2014 he felt seen in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The essay \u201c really got me to look at my sexual activity , and say , OK , is there something deeper going on here that I \u2019 m missing ?\n\u201d Schneiderman recalled .\nAfter months of reading and thinking , he said he realized he had sought to control the women in his life and felt entitled to sex not just because of the sexist culture he grew up in but because of the authority that his job conferred .\nEspecially during the Trump years , when he gained national stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean of power and privilege , but I didn \u2019 t even know I was underwater , \u201d Schneiderman told me .\nThe more his star rose , the more arrogant he became .\n\u201c Power creeps up on you , \u201d he said .\nHe came to see that it wasn \u2019 t right to have engaged in what he had thought of as \u201c rough sex \u201d without clear rules in advance , not to mention ongoing communication and trust \u2014 and that he \u201c had consent wrong \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing to them , that meant they were OK with it .\n\u201c While in some senses that may be legal consent , it \u2019 s not ethical consent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And the ethical consent requires me to make an inquiry into what a partner really wants and really likes .\nAnd I \u2019 m very much ashamed of the fact that I gave that so little thought.\n\u201d In November 2018 , Madeline Singas , then the district attorney who Cuomo had appointed to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to pursue charges against him , citing \u201c legal impediments , \u201d including statutes of limitation .\nIt was a huge relief for Schneiderman .\n\u201c I was able to get out of my \u2018 criminal defense loop , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nThe public statement he put out was very different from his previous denials .\n\u201c I recognize that District Attorney Singas \u2019 decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong , \u201d it said .\n\u201c I accept full responsibility for my conduct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the impact it had on them .\nAfter spending time in a rehab facility , I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed .\nI apologize for any and all pain that I have caused , and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me . ''\nThat recognition was not lost on the women who said Schneiderman had abused them .\nSelvaratnam later wrote that she found the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even further .\n\u201c I feel completely vindicated by Eric Schneiderman \u2019 s admission that he engaged in the abuse to which he subjected me and the other women , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted .\n\u201c I wish him well in his recovery process.\n\u201d In early 2019 , Schneiderman was at lunch with a friend who called # MeToo overreaching and intolerant and questioned whether there was anything men could ever do to appease their accusers .\nActually , Schneiderman told them , Time \u2019 s Up had recently offered simple instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform your behavior .\nMake restitution to those harmed .\n( His friend confirmed this exchange . )\nAfterward , Schneiderman emailed Hunter about the conversation .\n\u201c Oddly enough , I found myself in the role of defending the movement , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c It felt kind of good to be able to lay all of this out .\nAnd I felt somewhat calmer.\n\u201d Along with meditation , Schneiderman had been consulting with his rabbi , J. Rolando Matalon , who told me that there \u2019 s biblical precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAn elaborate priestly ritual described in the Book of Leviticus reintegrated people who had been separated from their community due to contagious skin diseases .\nMatalon thought that , similarly , there could be a ritual that would publicly reintroduce people who had been excluded because of moral offenses if they were able to make amends .\nHowever , Matalon counseled Schneiderman , Judaism makes clear \u201c that a pariah can not return without a serious process of repentance and personal transformation , and directly apologizing to those he has harmed.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction .\nAll she had ever wanted from Hoffman was for him to acknowledge and empathize with his accusers \u2019 claims .\nBut \u201c in the absence of any genuine apology , we were out for vengeance , \u201d she said .\nHunter and Schneiderman looked together for meaningful examples of apologies that sought to actively make things right , not just to individual survivors but to the larger public , but couldn \u2019 t find many .\nOne study of over 200 statements by people accused of sexual misconduct amid the # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included an apology of any kind .\nAnother found that even the highest-quality apologies \u2014 detailed , not defensive \u2014 left the public dissatisfied .\nThere was a single apology that Hunter and Schneiderman found inspiring .\nIn January 2018 , TV writer Dan Harmon apologized on his podcast to his former employee Megan Ganz , saying he realized he lacked respect for women , had hidden behind his progressive politics , and never would have changed his behavior if she hadn \u2019 t accused him publicly on Twitter .\nAfterward , Ganz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneiderman was nervous he \u2019 d get it wrong .\nAfter he graduated earlier that year from a meditation class in Manhattan , the studio posted a photo of its newly certified students .\nWhen Manning Barish found out , she was outraged .\nSchneiderman was \u201c an untreated sexual assaulter and predator , \u201d she tweeted .\n\u201c He has no business teaching meditation .\nHe has not even been rehabilitated yet.\n\u201d He told me he had no intention of teaching and that the class was for anyone who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the story , and he was banned from the studio .\nThe experience made him feel like it would be easier to stay silent .\n\u201c My male friends often say to me : don \u2019 t even try to apologize , \u201d he once wrote to Hunter in an email .\n\u201c Whatever you say won \u2019 t be enough .\nYou will be attacked all over again and will have admitted to wrongdoing.\n\u201d Hunter encouraged Schneiderman to push past his anxieties \u2014 if he had apologized earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing progress , maybe the meditation class incident would never have happened .\nIn February , she suggested he start with Selvaratnam .\nThe night before , Hunter and Schneiderman had discussed Selvaratnam \u2019 s New York Times article , in which she said he had \u201c tested \u201d her by giving her little slaps .\n\u201c I have never heard you understand Tanya \u2019 s point of view like you did last night , \u201d Hunter wrote to him .\n\u201c How it \u2019 s a slippery slope of giving in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for the sake of staying with someone.\n\u201d \u201c I am now clear : I am very , very sorry for my appalling conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote in a draft version .\n\u201c I have a lot more work to do and amends to make , but I felt that it was important to reach out as a work in progress and to tell you that I am sorry.\n\u201d It was brutally hard to face up to what he had done , he wrote , and for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what he did with any clarity .\n\u201c None of this excuses my conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c From the beginning , I bossed you around .\nMaybe lightheartedly at first , but over time , I became less and less considerate and more and more nasty and controlling .\nAnd I pushed you to go along with things in bed that I now recognize you did not want to do.\n\u201d He never asked her whether their relationship worked for her , he wrote .\nInstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply ashamed .\n\u201c I have a long way to go , but I am committed to doing the work I need to do to become a better , healthier human being , and to ensure that I never behave the way I did with you with anyone else ever again , \u201d he wrote .\nHunter was overcome after she read the draft .\n\u201c I think I \u2019 ve been honest about how emotional this is for me \u2014 that the weight I \u2019 m putting on this apology goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote to him .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not saying that \u2019 s right or healthy , but I haven \u2019 t spent the last 10 months talking to you so intensely just because you \u2019 re my friend and I care about you \u2026 Having you get to the point where you could even write a letter like this is all I have wanted since we started talking .\nFor you to GET IT .\nAs I said ... in many ways you \u2019 re a stand-in for all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , because they won \u2019 t even try.\n\u201d Schneiderman never sent the letter .\nShortly after he drafted it , he learned that a state committee that investigates wrongdoing by Manhattan attorneys was conducting a probe into the allegations against him .\nIf the First Department appellate court found him responsible , he could be suspended or disbarred from practicing law .\nThat wasn \u2019 t a consequence Schneiderman was willing to accept .\nHe shelved his apology plans , convinced that if he reached out to the women it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lawyered up again , reentering the \u201c criminal defense loop \u201d he had worked so hard to overcome .\nRecords show that his attorney \u2019 s response to the committee did not reflect Schneiderman \u2019 s newfound understanding of consent .\nInstead , it reiterated his old arguments , protesting that his \u201c consensual relationships with his romantic partners in the confines of his bedroom \u201d should not be subject to further scrutiny .\nWhen Schneiderman was deposed for the investigation in January 2020 , he said Manning Barish and Selvaratnam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c dominant-submissive \u201d sex life , according to the committee records .\n\u201c I \u2019 m confident that neither one of them ever after sex or the next morning said \u2018 I don \u2019 t like what you did , don \u2019 t do that anymore \u2019 or any words to that effect , \u201d he said .\nAll those emails and texts that Schneiderman had worked hard not to dwell on were deployed in an attempt to discredit the women .\nHe said in his deposition that , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her life , she had fought to stay together when he broke things off , \u201c devastated \u201d to lose him not \u201c just as a romantic partner but as a teammate for her career.\n\u201d He argued that the New Yorker was wrong that the anonymous woman in the Hamptons rebuffed him after he slapped her , and that the magazine had failed to report that they had stayed in \u201c warm and flirtatious \u201d touch afterward .\nAs for Manning Barish , the records cited emails from her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him she loved him , missed him , and wanted to marry him .\nReferencing allegations that former New York governor Eliot Spitzer had choked a woman , she said she felt sorry he hadn \u2019 t met the right girl yet .\n\u201c Too soon for you to give him my number ?\n\u201d she quipped .\nUntil Schneiderman , \u201c no one ever understood my darkness , \u201d she wrote to him .\n\u201c I miss that part of me being controlled and celebrated.\n\u201d In his deposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrite statement he had released after the DA declined to prosecute .\nFor the women who said he \u2019 d abused them , that statement had been validating and vindicating .\nFor Schneiderman himself , it had represented crucial progress forward on his path toward self-improvement .\nBut it was the committee \u2019 s job to assess whether he had committed professional misconduct and should be disciplined , not to ensure the women got what they needed to heal .\nAnd to the committee lawyer , it seemed , that statement was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf his relationships with the women were as \u201c vibrant and consensual \u201d as he had just described , the lawyer asked , \u201c for what were you apologizing ?\n\u201d Hunter grew frustrated as she watched from the sidelines .\nShe still held out hope that one day Schneiderman would make full amends to the women , and that they would get the reckoning she herself had never received .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bI was vengeful \u201d toward Hoffman , \u201c but mostly I wanted all of us to stop hurting so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the adversarial legal proceeding made that hope an increasingly distant possibility .\nExperts in restorative justice insist there is a better approach in these types of situations .\nWhether administered through the legal system or outside of it , restorative justice is at its heart a community-based process that seeks to honor the needs of those hurt and ensure accountability for those who caused them harm , instead of asking who broke the law and how they should be penalized .\n\u201c It can be difficult to come to the realization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished in order for you to heal , \u201d said Sonya Shah , a restorative justice practitioner who is also a sexual assault survivor .\nThe practitioners who spoke with me said restorative justice , which is inspired by the conflict-resolution practices of some Indigenous cultures , is most crucial for people in marginalized communities .\nThey are the ones who face disproportionate punishment in the justice system , not privileged white men ( or in Schneiderman \u2019 s case , a privileged white former law enforcement officer ) .\nBut some restorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a closer look at # MeToo .\nThey said they understood the valid anger the movement unleashed , but that harsher retribution wasn \u2019 t the answer .\nResearch has shown prison does not effectively rehabilitate offenders , and the criminal justice system can retraumatize and disempower survivors , who often say they want their assailant to change but not to be locked up .\nMost sexual assault and harassment claims are never even referred for prosecution \u2014 which is more evidence that other options are needed , experts said .\nFiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it doesn \u2019 t necessarily prevent them from getting another job where they hurt more people .\nPublic shaming can spread awareness , but on its own it provides no road map for ending the cycles of harm , experts said , especially since plenty of the most high-profile # MeToo men seem like they \u2019 re doing just fine and have no regrets other than getting called out .\nPractitioners said restorative justice doesn \u2019 t let offenders off easy \u2014 in order to participate in the process , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept responsibility \u2014 and that it always centers survivors \u2019 needs .\nIt also allows the parties to make progress even if they don \u2019 t agree on all of the facts .\nShah said she has counseled men who committed sexual assault who were willing to apologize for some but not all of what they were accused of , and she has worked with survivors who felt that a partial apology could still be beneficial .\n\u201c We come down so hard on people when they cause harm that they learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is to remain silent , defend themselves , and admit nothing , \u201d said Erika Sasson , a former litigator and long-standing restorative justice practitioner .\nThis fundamental right to a defense is important in court , she said , but it makes it harder for people to be honest with each other and break the silence and secrecy of abuse .\nTelling the truth , she said , takes \u201c courage , communication , and support.\n\u201d In April 2021 , the First Department appellate court issued its ruling : Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , conditioned upon continuing therapy and supervision .\nThe decision included a statement of facts that didn \u2019 t substantiate all of the claims against him , but Schneiderman admitted that he had slapped Selvaratnam and Manning Barish and placed his hands on their necks and applied pressure without first obtaining consent .\nHe also admitted to emotionally abusing them , and to slapping the anonymous woman from the Hamptons twice .\nThese avowals , however , were part of a legal settlement that didn \u2019 t seem to fully satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women learned that Schneiderman had tried to protect himself by blaming them .\nThe validation they expressed after his earlier statement of remorse was demolished .\n\u201c I initially chose not to participate in this after having to keep testifying over and over again , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted after the decision .\n\u201c But they went after Eric anyway , and he chose to compose a complete lie of a narrative to defend himself , and discredit me .\nSo I fought back.\n\u201d Schneiderman , she wrote , \u201c belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her book about Schneiderman at the time , and she spoke about how she believed in redemption if an abuser \u201c acknowledges the harm that they have committed and does the hard work to root out their abusive behavior.\n\u201d But the one-year suspension was \u201c not enough \u201d to reform Schneiderman , she said .\nThough they were not in contact , she was confident he hadn \u2019 t changed , because she had heard from other professed victims of his , including someone who said he abused her after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selvaratnam \u2019 s book , her evidence for that claim was an email she received from a woman who said Schneiderman was a \u201c sadist and predator \u201d who had \u201c targeted \u201d her .\nShe didn \u2019 t include more details .\nSelvaratnam acknowledged that she did not speak to the woman and couldn \u2019 t \u201c vouch for her experience.\n\u201d Still , the note felt like \u201c an affirmation.\n\u201d \u201c It also sparked the first time I felt rage toward Eric , \u201d she wrote .\nWhen I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allegation and said he hadn \u2019 t been romantically involved with a woman since May 2018 .\nHe said Selvaratnam didn \u2019 t reach out to him before publishing her book or before repeating the claim to the press .\nAfter the ruling , the anonymous Hamptons woman identified herself as Danya Perry , a prominent attorney who used to work for the Southern District of New York .\nPerry told me she was horrified and distraught when Schneiderman slapped her during a romantic encounter after a party , and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , she said , it seemed like Schneiderman had genuinely misread the situation .\nHe told her he had dated other women who enjoyed being slapped , and she believed him when he said he had made a drunken mistake .\nBut when Perry heard that journalists were looking into a possible pattern , she decided to tell them about her experience .\nShe wasn \u2019 t interested in prosecuting Schneiderman , and at first she didn \u2019 t want any role in the committee proceeding either .\nLosing his job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learned that he had defended himself by minimizing the fact that he slapped her and exaggerating her forgiveness .\n\u201c If he had acknowledged and apologized , I would have said , Why do we need to punish this guy anymore ?\n\u201d she told me .\nPerry decided to cooperate .\nI also reached out to Jess McIntosh , who in 2018 wrote an essay for Elle about going on an unsettling date with Schneiderman in the early 2000s .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what happens to Eric Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have any power over the women of New York anymore , \u201d McIntosh said .\n\u201c I very much care about taking away power from people who don \u2019 t treat women as human beings and are somehow surprised that acting physically violent is wrong.\n\u201d She was skeptical and unimpressed when I told her about his conversations with Hunter .\n\u201c I hope he stays woke , \u201d she said , \u201c and I hope he stays quiet.\n\u201d None of the women who spoke out in 2018 seemed satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists .\nThe criminal justice system couldn \u2019 t address his harm .\nThe committee decision didn \u2019 t appease them , and in some ways the process seemed to make matters worse .\nPublic awareness pushed Schneiderman out of power but hasn \u2019 t held him accountable for whatever he has or hasn \u2019 t done since .\nOver the last four years , post- # MeToo efforts toward systemic progress have delivered mixed results .\nLawmakers have introduced a wave of carceral bills that some experts say will do more harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed by # MeToo have been replaced by women in the workplace \u2014 for example , Letitia James holds Schneiderman \u2019 s former position \u2014 but many others have scored new jobs and been nominated for fancy awards .\nMeanwhile , Time \u2019 s Up , the prominent anti-harassment charity that was supposed to tackle structural # MeToo issues , fell into crisis because of its ties to Cuomo .\nThere has been scant funding or research to determine how restorative justice might address these issues on a larger scale , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act has a proposal set aside for restorative practices .\nAlthough it \u2019 s been nearly three years since Schneiderman said he knew his path forward included amends and restitution , he still has yet to directly apologize to Selvaratnam , Manning Barish , or Perry .\nAs for restitution , he said , he plans on asking them for their input at some point in the future .\nHe hasn \u2019 t yet donated any of his own money for that purpose \u2014 \u201c I \u2019 ve been unemployed for three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of prospects , \u201d he said \u2014 but he has donated millions to charity from his old campaign fund , which he can only legally withdraw from for a few purposes .\n( He also returned money to donors who asked for it back and used some to cover his legal fees . )\nSelvaratnam has written that she thought it wrong of him to launder his reputation with charitable donations , while Manning Barish recently posted online that she thought it was disgusting he hadn \u2019 t donated more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer for progressive causes .\nBefore his license was suspended , he reached out to a number of groups , but no one wanted to be publicly associated with him , he said , not even a nonprofit that works with formerly incarcerated people who have committed murder and rape .\nEventually he realized that if he swore never to disclose his participation \u2014 if he \u201c worked like a blacklisted screenwriter in the 1950s \u201d \u2014 he could do interesting and useful work , such as advising organizations on legal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soup kitchen through his synagogue .\nRabbi Matalon told me that egoless community service is an important part of repentance : \u201c Atonement requires humility.\n\u201d Schneiderman insisted that his journey is ongoing and that he has already made meaningful amends to some people in his life .\nHe repeatedly said that he still hopes to do so to the women who participated in the committee investigation , but he can \u2019 t consider it until he gets his law license back \u2014 which could take a while , since he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up \u2014 lest he seem to be interfering in the legal process , since there might a hearing where the women could be called to testify .\nThere \u2019 s another factor , too .\nHe wouldn \u2019 t speak about the details of his sobriety , but in many programs , such as Alcoholics Anonymous , making amends is a step that comes later on , after committing a \u201c searching and fearless moral inventory \u201d of oneself .\nBut neither reason explains why he agreed to give me the draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or why he wouldn \u2019 t reach out to Perry even after I shared what she told me about her willingness to engage .\nDoes he deserve more patience and support , or is he a lost cause who , despite all claims to the contrary , cares only about restoring his public image ?\nIn the absence of any formalized process that might thoroughly hold Schneiderman accountable , he \u2019 s decided to try his luck in the court of public opinion , leaving it up to the readers of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .\n\u201c I \u2019 m trying to do the next right thing every day , \u201d Schneiderman said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m still working on fully understanding the consequences of my conduct.\n\u201d He added , \u201c I \u2019 ve come to understand that the process I \u2019 m in now requires me to take some time before making certain amends , and I \u2019 m respecting that process and trying to do it the right way.\n\u201d Part of her is afraid to go public with their friendship because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s an enabler or betraying the movement .\nWhen I saw them both recently and asked Schneiderman to triple-confirm he would never run for office again , which he did , she quipped to him , \u201c If you did , I wouldn \u2019 t be your friend , \u201d and then followed up with me to say that she was serious and hoped I \u2019 d include that in the story : \u201c Running for office again would be the worst possible move for a recovering narcissist !\n\u201d There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .\n\u201c How do we make men care ?\n\u201d she asked me one day .\n\u201c Does a fear of being disgraced have to be part of the incentive ?\n\u201d But as long as Schneiderman keeps digging into his past and trying to make things right for the future \u2014 and as long as their exchanges continue to fascinate and challenge her \u2014 she \u2019 ll take walks and share meals with him , continuing their conversations about sex , power , and abuse .\nHunter always felt that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Schneiderman for her own benefit as much as for his .\nBut in August 2021 , Hunter read a New York magazine article about a form of restorative justice called \u201c surrogate dialogue \u201d in which survivors work through their trauma not with their own assailant but with someone else who committed similar offenses .\nHunter was shocked to realize that she and Schneiderman had , in their own unsupervised , extremely ad hoc way , been engaging in a version of that .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate that word , \u201d Hunter said .\n\u201c But having this extended conversation with Eric over three years where I have seen him deepen his own understanding and also deepen mine in a way , has \u2014 in the absence of any genuine reckoning or apology I \u2019 m going to get from any man who has hurt me \u2014 been the next best thing.\n\u201d \u25cf",

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nCondoms get a bad rap .\nDespite being around since the dawn of time ( well , modern condoms were invented in the 1800s ) and being a pretty reliable and safe way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been on the decline since roughly 2015 .\nI think most people would agree that the trend isn \u2019 t a positive one .\nCDC data suggest that STI rates hit an all-time high in 2019 for the sixth consecutive year in a row .\nOne of the reasons people may not be that into condoms is they are using the wrong type or size .\nYes , fit matters !\n( When was a one-size-fits-all approach ever a good idea for anything ? )\nIf a condom is too small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn the other hand , if it \u2019 s too large , there could be spillage or it may simply fall off .\nAccording to Melissa White , founder and CEO of fit-focused condom purveyor Lucky Bloke , only about 50 % of people with penises should be wearing a medium or standard-fit condom , which is about 90 % of what you \u2019 ll see on the shelves in conventional retail stores .\nAnother 30 % to 35 % require a snugger , more secure fit , and the remaining 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger size or Magnum condom .\nAnd no , condom size is not actually related to length , so put away your ruler or measuring tape .\nInstead , grab an empty toilet paper roll and measure for girth ( if it fits nicely in there , you \u2019 re likely a standard fit ; too tight and you should go larger , too much space and you should go smaller ) .\nThough it may be tempting for people with penises to grab a box of Magnums more as a status symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise against using condoms that are too big .\nPeople probably aren \u2019 t talking enough about condoms All too often sex education in general is a fail in the US , and that can certainly apply to knowledge about condoms , said Ashley Townes , a postdoctoral research associate at the CDC who focuses on sexual health .\nA stigma against buying the correct size condom may be particularly pervasive in teenage boys who simply don \u2019 t know any better .\nTownes , who is a former sex educator , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they need to know about choosing and using the right condom .\n\u201c You get one lesson to talk about contraceptives , and condoms are only a sliver of all the different contraceptives available , \u201d she said .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t have a lot of time to dive into it , so it can be challenging even as an educator to really go in depth about , How do you choose one that fits ?\nHow do you choose one that feels good for you ?\n\u201d And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about condom use is more than some people get , including those at schools where sex ed isn \u2019 t covered at all .\n\u201c Sex education isn \u2019 t mandatory across the United States , \u201d said \u00c9va Goicochea , founder of sexual wellness company Maude .\n\u201c Even if it is , it 's not always medically accurate , and so what ends up happening is that when they 're teaching about condoms , often they \u2019 re not able to open them in the classroom , so it 's harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Condom use has fallen out of the conversation a bit as focus has shifted to consent and sexual assault prevention , social demographer Laura Lindberg said .\n\u201c What we see in sex education and health education more generally is as certain topics rise in importance , there \u2019 s less space and time to talk about other things that used to be discussed because nobody 's expanding the amount of time , \u201d she said .\nA 2021 study in the Journal of Adolescent Health of 2,291 college students found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about consent than condom use or STI prevention .\n\u201c In my era , I was literally the first group who was getting the , Here \u2019 s a banana .\nHere \u2019 s a condom .\nThis is important because everyone around you could have HIV , \u201d Lindberg said .\n\u201c Now the first talk you get your freshman week on a college campus is about consent .\nBut they \u2019 re not doing two talks , so you don \u2019 t get space to talk about condoms.\n\u201d Finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perk of wearing a properly fitting condom is that it \u2019 s also going to feel better , likely for both partners .\n\u201c A common response we get is that using a condom will interfere with your pleasure , \u201d said Lindberg , who is also a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute , referring to the answers they get on their surveys .\n\u201c I think we need to be honest that it may interfere with people \u2019 s sexual pleasure , and here are steps you can take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right fit , Lindberg had one main piece of advice when it comes to making sex with condoms feel better : \u201c Lubricate , lubricate , lubricate.\n\u201d Townes agreed , noting that people often don \u2019 t want to use lubricant even though it can increase pleasure and reduce the feeling of the condom itself .\nWhite added that using lubricant also makes the condom more effective from a safety perspective .\n\u201c Latex condoms in particular are naturally drying , \u201d White said .\n\u201c So your receiving partner is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes the condom less safe.\n\u201d White recommends putting a few drops inside the condom and a generous amount on the outside to help both parties feel more pleasure and reduce friction to maximize safety .\nTownes also recommended trying compatible sex toys with your condom to spice things up , like a vibrating cock ring or an external vibrator that won \u2019 t interfere with the effectiveness of the condom .\nPeople are still using condoms , just not often enough Despite the fact that there \u2019 s less consistency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , Lindberg feels it \u2019 s important to recognize how far we \u2019 ve come in making condoms more socially acceptable .\nHer research shows that condom use at first intercourse has gone up dramatically , and 9 out of 10 sexually active teenagers have used a condom at some point .\n\u201c There aren \u2019 t declines in contraceptive use overall , \u201d Lindberg said .\n\u201c So young people are replacing condom use with other methods of contraception , and I think that speaks to the increased availability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pill.\n\u201d As great as it is that there are so many other contraceptive methods available , only condoms can protect against both STIs and pregnancy .\nDepending on your access to healthcare , condoms may also be easier to get since they don \u2019 t require a prescription and are relatively inexpensive .\nThat can be particularly appealing if you \u2019 re not having consistent sex and don \u2019 t want to be on a contraceptive all the time .\nAnd on a very basic level , they make sex less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Lindberg assured that the best way for a condom to fail is to not use it .\n( In truth , condoms are 98 % effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly . )\nIf you find you have barriers to buying condoms IRL , such as a fear of judgmental drugstore clerks or running into your old English teacher , this guide should help .\nAll of these condoms are available online for an embarrassment-free buying experience .",

        "content": "While pandemic-related stress , anxiety , and grief due to the more than 900,000 COVID deaths in the US have had a well-documented impact on mental health , changes in daily life , like staying home for extended periods of time , can also affect other parts of your body , including your eyes , skin , and ability to focus .\nBuzzFeed News spoke to several doctors and experts about how spending more time at home can transform bodies in the short and long term .\nSpending more time indoors is known to increase the risk of nearsightedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in JAMA Ophthalmology suggested that during the pandemic , there were 1.4 to 3 times more cases of myopia in 2020 among children ages 6 to 8 than in the previous five years .\nThat wasn \u2019 t the case for kids ages 9 to 13 , who didn \u2019 t experience increases in myopia diagnoses .\nThe link is less studied in adults , but Dr. Mika Moy , an eye doctor and health sciences clinical professor at the University of California , Berkeley School of Optometry , said she isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients .\nHowever , close work ( spending hours reading or looking at something less than 20 centimeters , or about 7 to 8 inches distance from your face ) coupled with low light levels are thought to play a role in increased myopia risk .\n\u201c There 's other sort of generalizations , like people who live in cities tend to be more nearsighted than people who live in the country , and we think that 's because we 're finding there 's a protective connection with the outdoors , \u201d Moy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only eye-related problem that \u2019 s occurring during the pandemic .\nFor eyes , lockdowns in March 2020 were like having to \u201c run marathons without any training , \u201d Moy told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Your meetings are on the screen , your work is on the screen , and now everyone 's leisure time seems to also be on these screens.\n\u201d Often people forget to blink when staring at a screen for a long time , which deprives their eyes of moisturizing tears .\nWe \u2019 re also stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that secrete oil into our tears every time we blink .\nBlinking less can cause the glands to \u201c shrink away , \u201d Moy said , which isn \u2019 t good in the long run .\nEye drops called artificial tears can help relieve dryness , but they may not work as well as warm compresses .\nMoy suggests placing a warm washcloth over your eyes for 10 minutes about two times a day to feel relief .\nYou can also develop eye fatigue , which occurs when the muscles that control your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ; some people may get headaches or experience blurry vision as a result , Moy said .\nBlue light exposure is another factor to consider , which electronic devices emit .\nIt has one of the shorter yet higher energy wavelengths on the visible light spectrum , but experts agree there isn \u2019 t strong scientific evidence that shows it actually causes eye fatigue or damage .\n( Too much of it at night can make it harder for you to fall asleep , though , Moy said . )\nSo yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from staring at your computer all day , but the infamous blue light probably isn \u2019 t the culprit here .\nIn fact , the sun produces at least 100 times more blue light than a typical smartphone , the American Optometric Association says .\nThis means your fancy blue light glasses may not be doing much ; the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn \u2019 t recommend them .\nAnecdotally , however , Moy said her patients think they \u2019 re helpful ( personally , I think so , too , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne pair of glasses that might help are computer glasses , or \u201c occupational lenses , \u201d which are prescription frames that correct your vision specifically for computer-length distance , preventing your eyes from working too hard .\nThere are also some nonprescription reading glasses that are specifically made for computer work .\nOne of the best things you can do is give your eyes a break and try the 20-20-20 rule : every 20 minutes look 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds .\nOtherwise , take some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more ways than one .\nAlthough being indoors can protect you from sunburns and major risks of skin cancer from exposure to ultraviolet light , your vitamin D levels can drop because you \u2019 re not absorbing sunlight that helps your body produce it , notes Dr. Elizabeth Bahar Houshmand , a double board-certified dermatologist in Texas .\nVitamin D supports immune health , muscle function , brain activity , and the absorption of important minerals such as calcium , magnesium , and phosphate .\nStudies show vitamin D deficiency is associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone and muscle issues ( more on that later ) , and other health problems .\nA lack of sunlight exposure , darker skin , and older age increase your chances of having a deficiency .\nThe good news is that at least one 2021 study published in the European Journal of Public Health found that vitamin D deficiency was no more common in patients in Italy during 2020 lockdowns compared with previous years , suggesting it may not always be an issue for those of us spending extra time at home during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of sun exposure is necessary for your body to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D. Stepping outside for \u201c a few minutes a day is enough , \u201d Dr. Joshua Zeichner , director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , told BuzzFeed News .\nYou can also get your vitamin D from fortified foods , supplements , and certain foods like salmon and egg yolks .\nWhat both dermatologists have noticed during the pandemic is more patients coming in with rashes , acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes facial redness and pimplelike bumps on the skin .\nZeichner blames face masks , stress , and poor eating habits ( namely , eating too much sugar ) .\nSugar can promote inflammation in the body and drive oil production that can lead to acne breakouts , he said .\nOver time , excess sugar can trigger glycation \u2014 when sugar molecules attach to proteins in your skin called collagen \u2014 which can contribute to wrinkles , he said .\nRegular exercise can help .\nIt keeps your skin cells functioning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeichner said .\n\u201c The days may seem long and repetitive , but keep up with your skincare routine , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What you do now certainly will have an impact on your skin in the future.\n\u201d Then there \u2019 s a less obvious but still insidious impact on your body ( and mind ) .\nPeople are spending more time in Zoom meetings where staring at themselves in the harsh glare of a computer is making them more self-conscious about the way they look .\nBoth dermatologists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get rid of dark spots , wrinkles , and undereye bags .\nZeichner recommends wearing sunscreen , even indoors because harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can still pierce through windows and penetrate your skin .\nVarious stress-inducing pollutants also exist inside your home , Houshmand said , especially in the winter when central heating and lack of fresh air can dry your skin ; she recommends setting up a humidifier in your home to help .\nIf you \u2019 re anything like Michel , the 23-year-old with back trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains associated with turning your home into a workspace .\nDr. Charla Fischer , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News she \u2019 s seeing more patients come in with back pain related to poor posture while working from home .\n\u201c We sit in a bad position all day , hunched over a laptop , and the muscles get overstretched and microtears develop .\nThen the muscle starts to cramp because of this injury , and we get pain , \u201d Fischer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just an achy back .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c as dangerous for your health as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day , \u201d Dr. Nicholas DiNubile , an orthopedic surgeon at Premier Orthopedics And Sports Medicine in Pennsylvania and American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons spokesperson , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c We already have a big problem in our nation with this , and the pandemic only made it worse.\n\u201d Add inactivity with a lack of vitamin D and you have a \u201c real issue , \u201d DiNubile said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone health , but also muscle injuries , and tears are more common when levels are low.\n\u201d Kids , for example , are getting more injuries now that they \u2019 re returning to physical activities after about two years of home confinement .\n\u201c Never in my entire career have I gone two weeks without seeing an ACL injury , \u201d DiNubile said , yet at the beginning of the pandemic , about five months passed with no injured kid in sight .\n\u201c Now it \u2019 s payback .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being sedentary could lead to loss of muscle , too , which could slow metabolism and contribute to weight gain and obesity , he added .\nAnd over two-plus years , osteoporosis , or bone thinning , could become an issue , which is particularly worrisome for white and Asian women , postmenopausal women , and teenagers ( given bone health is built in teen years ) , DiNubile said .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important to make sure your home is equipped to support your body as best as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ergonomically appropriate equipment , like a monitor , adjustable office chair , keyboard , computer mouse , and proper back support .\nYou should set your monitor at eye level , keyboard at lap level , and both knees at a 90-degree angle , Fischer suggests , and incorporate standing breaks , short walks , and stretching into your daily routine to prevent future pain .\nSeating arrangements without cushions and solid back support will allow your body to slouch and form a \u201c C \u201d curve , said Fischer , who \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dining chair instead ( you can buy lumbar support pillows that fit any chair ) , and only use your bed for sleeping , she said .\n\u201c Mattresses are not designed for us to sit and do work on them.\n\u201d Our brains are incredibly adaptive , constantly adjusting to their surroundings .\nBut for some , shifting workplaces and social situations can have some surprising and unexpected impacts on daily life .\nJohn Redding , 46 , of Texas , said his inability to focus even for short periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor nuisance to a major issue , \u201d even with the help of medication .\n\u201c I used to be a voracious reader , but I have n't read an entire book since the pandemic started.\n\u201d Sam Ling , an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University , told BuzzFeed News some people may be less productive at home because there are more distractions there .\nHowever , that \u2019 s not the case for everyone .\nSereena Millward , 28 , told us she struggles to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office again .\n\u201c The sounds of people talking and eating at their desk grate on me , but I also can \u2019 t concentrate if it \u2019 s deadly silent.\n\u201d ( This feeling is called misophonia . )\nThat \u2019 s because a shift in how people interact from in person to online \u2014 and then back again \u2014 can be a bit of adjustment .\n\u201c There \u2019 s exhaustion that \u2019 s involved in monitoring social cues when there \u2019 s so little information available , \u201d Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimuli overload when we return to face-to-face interactions that may be overwhelming for some .\nLing noted that retraining our brains to socialize as we used to could take some time .\nThe brain is a muscle ; the parts we don \u2019 t exercise regularly will get a little wonky .\n\u201c COVID has promoted this hermitlike life , \u201d he said , although he doesn \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve permanently rewired our \u201c pretty plastic \u201d brains to solely tolerate the comfort of our homes .\n\u201c On so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest experiments that has ever been done on the human brain.\n\u201d Pandemic home life has been a blessing in disguise for some people .\nIt helped Abby Adesanya , 29 , experience a specific ( and pleasurable ) bodily sensation for the first time in April 2020 as she was listening to Dua Lipa \u2019 s Future Nostalgia album alone in her New York apartment .\n\u201c I was blasting the album , throwing my hands in the air , wishing I could be dancing in the clubs to this .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders start to vibrate , and it spread down my arms.\n\u201d Adesanya was experiencing frisson : the chills and goosebumps often felt after listening to music or watching something in synchrony .\nAnywhere between 55 % to 86 % of people experience frisson , yet Adesanya had never felt it .\n\u201c I can not believe my body suddenly just unlocked this ability .\nI do n't know if it was trying to fill in the blanks for missing stimuli .\nBut the fact it 's here is so cool , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really dark time.\n\u201d Ling said he isn \u2019 t surprised by Adesanya \u2019 s breakthrough .\nIt \u2019 s possible when going from a hyperstimulated environment such as life in New York City to a quiet apartment that the reduction in stimuli helped unbusy her mind .\nIt \u2019 s what meditation does for many people , he said .\nAnother body part that might have suffered during the pandemic is your teeth .\nThe cost and need for insurance normally prevents many people from going to the dentist , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dental work , added another barrier to routine checkups .\nKelly Holst , an assistant professor at Temple University \u2019 s Kornberg School of Dentistry in Pennsylvania , told BuzzFeed News this worsened dental problems for many people .\n\u201c There 's only so much you can do at home .\nYou can \u2019 t scrape off the plaque , food debris , and bacteria that harden and calcify on your teeth \u201d without a dentists \u2019 help , said Holst , who also noticed an uptick in patients with preexisting dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse boat.\n\u201d Pandemic-related stress and missed appointments have left some people with jaw pain associated with teeth grinding , too , she added .\nExtra time at home also means more , often unnecessary , snacking , which is \u201c notoriously bad for your oral health \u201d and clears the way for cavities to form , Holst said .\n\u201c At work , you 're sort of more regimented with your food intake .\nAt home , you kind of have that freedom to graze.\n\u201d Certain acidic foods and drinks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sports drinks , soda , and alcohol ) can contribute to demineralization in your enamel \u2014 the outer layer of your teeth and strongest tissue in your body \u2014 and make your mouth more acidic by throwing off your oral pH level , Holst said .\nDon \u2019 t want to put down the snacks ?\nHolst suggests you eat or drink them right away and avoid nibbling or sipping throughout the day .\nThat way you give your mouth time to naturally recalibrate itself .\nOtherwise , use fluoride toothpaste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine cleanings , and use an electric toothbrush , she said .\nSeveral people we spoke to said their body size experienced the most change during the pandemic .\nSome people lost weight , others gained .\nPatr\u00edcia Romano , 26 , used to struggle to gain weight ( she blames genetics and stress ) , but when her job became remote in 2020 , she stopped walking to and from work and gained 11 pounds .\nInstead of skipping lunch and dinner on the regular , she started eating more homemade meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to .\nBut the weight gain was rough for Romano , who \u2019 s a lawyer in Brazil .\nShe became obsessed with analyzing her body in the mirror and noticing flaws that many others likely couldn \u2019 t notice .\nIt got so bad that Romano took regular pregnancy tests because she would \u201c see a huge stomach , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c Now that some time has passed , it does n't bother me as much anymore , \u201d Romano said .\n\u201c I gave up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing it as this new body that has endured the delicate time of a worldwide stressful situation.\n\u201d Heidi ( who didn \u2019 t feel comfortable sharing her last name ) told us she got so tired of cooking for herself at home that she \u201c ended up eating less and losing a bunch of weight , which triggered some weird fatigue issues that were made worse with pandemic burnout and work-from-home/isolation.\n\u201d In general , you shouldn \u2019 t feel bad about weight changes during the pandemic .\nWe \u2019 ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nOne part of your body may have been particularly sensitive to all the changes related to your diet , mental health , and activity levels during the pandemic \u2014 your gastrointestinal tract .\nDr. Sarah McGill , an associate professor of medicine specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , told BuzzFeed News many patients say added stress and loneliness during the pandemic has led to an increase in abdominal pain , diarrhea , and nausea .\n\u201c The GI tract has even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we feel can cause GI distress , \u201d McGill said .\nWhat \u2019 s more , people increased their drinking during the pandemic , which isn \u2019 t a positive trend given alcohol is directly toxic to your GI tract , can cause fat to accumulate in your liver , and contribute to liver damage , McGill said .\nA Johns Hopkins survey of 832 adults over 21 found 60 % reported increased drinking in May 2020 compared to pre-COVID times and 34 % reported binge drinking .\nStress , alcohol availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers for increased drinking .\nFor Beth Boardman , 61 , a writer and retired nurse in California , regular afternoon wine on an empty stomach led her to develop acute gastritis and esophagitis , or inflammation of the lining of the stomach and esophagus .\nMcGill said you should avoid alcohol as much as you can , and exercise regularly , which will keep your bowel movements flowing as they should , help you maintain a stable weight , and keep your heart healthy .\nSpeaking of bowel movements , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending more time at home .\nWhile some people may have experienced more constipation from a suddenly sedentary lifestyle , others may have seen an improvement from an increased ability to listen to body cues \u2014 and easier access to a bathroom .\nHolding back bowel movements \u2014 for example , because you \u2019 re commuting or working in a busy office \u2014 can make constipation more likely , McGill said .\nSo , it \u2019 s safe to say spending more time at home may have made going to the bathroom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced diet consisting of fruits , vegetables , and fiber-rich whole grains is important to keep things running smoothly , whether you are spending time at home or more time out of the house .\n\u201c Fiber directly contributes to gut health by feeding the trillions of microorganisms we have there , which in turn help us with our mood , metabolism , and lots of other aspects of health , \u201d McGill said .",

        "content": "At the heart of Palin \u2019 s lawsuit against the Times and former opinion editor James Bennet is an editorial the newspaper ran on June 14 , 2017 , some 12 hours after a Bernie Sanders supporter opened fire on a group of Republican members of Congres practicing at a Virginia baseball field , wounding Rep. Steve Scalise .\nThe editorial compared that shooting to another one in Arizona in 2011 , in which a man seriously injured Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others .\n\u201c The link to political incitement was clear , \u201d read the language Bennet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , referring to the Arizona shooting and a 2010 map produced by Palin \u2019 s PAC that featured gun crosshairs over the districts of Democrats like Giffords who had voted for Obamacare and were up for reelection in competitive races .\nBut as critics of the paper soon pointed out after the editorial ran online that night , there was no established link between that map and the gunman in the Giffords shooting , who had a mental illness .\nIn his testimony on Wednesday , Bennet told the court he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make about heated political rhetoric in the runup to the Giffords shooting .\nOnly the shooter and his \u201c derangement \u201d were to blame for the attack , Bennet said , but the Palin PAC map was still indirectly connected to the incident because it expressly named and targeted Giffords .\n`` I \u2019 ve regretted this pretty much every day since I meant it was simply a connection to this larger environment , \u201d Bennet said Wednesday of his original choice of words .\n\u201c If I thought it caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word \u2018 caused.\n\u2019 It would have saved me a couple of words.\n\u201d The crosshairs map was criticized for its gun imagery when it was first published by Palin \u2019 s PAC and then again in the wake of the Giffords shooting .\nPalin told the court on Thursday she found those criticisms at the time to be \u201c mortifying \u201d and untruthful .\nThe Arizona shooting had particularly horrified her , she said , because one of the victims , 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green , was roughly the same age as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols map , she conceded , could be viewed as being crosshairs , but could also be seen as \u201c emojis , \u201d \u201c surveyor \u2019 s markers , \u201d or \u201c bull 's eyes , \u201d she argued .\nIt was not , she said , urging violence .\n\u201c I took issue with the interpretation that anybody would have that it was some kind of call to violence , \u201d Palin said .\nWhen the Times referenced the map in its 2017 editorial , Palin said she felt the newspaper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had given an interview to the conservative website Breitbart ( which she then reposted to her own website ) warning the media and others against blaming Sanders for the actions of his supporter .\nNow , she said , the Times had done just that .\n\u201c The New York Times \u2014 the be-all and end-all , the loud voice in media \u2014 had already taken that knee-jerk reaction and I felt was trying to score political points , \u201d she said .\nIn a confusing moment of testimony , Palin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper had printed the false assertion .\nWhen the Times attorneys objected , Judge Jed Rakoff felt compelled to intervene , asking Palin whether she was saying the newspaper had printed this falsehood before .\n\u201c Precisely , \u201d she said , accusing them of having \u201c led the charge \u201d in trying to connect the map and the Arizona shooting before the 2017 attack .\nBut in a moment that recalled the vague answers she famously gave to journalist Katie Couric in 2008 about what newspapers she read , Palin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis bizarre testimony prompted an almost 20-minute break wherein the judge and opposing counsel conferred in a separate room , while Palin sat quietly in the witness box before the jury .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There was a burst of energy in the Senate last month to block future attempts to overturn electoral college votes and steal a presidential election .\nBut that momentum has stalled and no bill is expected anytime soon .\nA bipartisan group of senators has been negotiating how to prevent a vice president from overturning election results during the electoral college count .\nFormer president Donald Trump and his allies hoped to exploit legal ambiguities in January 2021 to overturn his loss to Joe Biden .\nThat plan ultimately went nowhere as then\u2013vice president Mike Pence and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot .\nAfter the Democrats failed to get enough votes to pass their voting rights bill last month , talks quickly began on a bipartisan bill to fix the process of certifying elections .\nBut early enthusiasm around finding bipartisan agreement to change election laws has now settled into a long slog of figuring out how to actually do it .\nThe timeline is now being talked about in terms of months or even years .\n\u201c Oh , it \u2019 s a long way to go , \u201d said Sen. Mitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c But it doesn \u2019 t get called into question until 2024 so we have plenty of time to work on it.\n\u201d Bipartisan efforts often collapse because of politics , but both sides are indicating that is not the case here .\nThe will is there , they say .\nThe problem is how complicated the issue is .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve still got a lot of research to do .\nIt \u2019 s a lot of work .\nWe \u2019 re meeting regularly , we \u2019 re talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut it \u2019 s a ways to go , \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins , who is leading the Republican side .\nSenators are looking to amend the Electoral Count Act , a 135-year-old arcane and often confusing document that lays out how election disputes are settled .\nThe law states that the sitting vice president will preside over the Senate when it counts electoral college votes on Jan. 6 .\nTraditionally , this role has been ceremonial .\nBut Trump argued \u2014 and continues to argue \u2014 that the vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reject electors sent by the states .\nThere seems to be clearly enough support across both parties to amend the law to clarify that the vice president \u2019 s role is only symbolic .\nEven Sen. Ron Johnson , a Republican who frequently repeated unverified claims about voter fraud , told BuzzFeed News he supports such a measure .\nThe problem is what else gets included .\nPoliticians are trying to balance the powers , responsibilities , and limitations of three separate entities in a way that will avoid a constitutional crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the states , which are in charge of running elections , certifying the results , and sending slates of electors to Congress .\nThese electors , making up the electoral college , ultimately select the next president .\nYou have Congress , whose role is to certify and count those electors .\nThen you have the courts , which have been regularly brought in to moderate disputes in recent history , but which could be overruled by Congress .\nLet \u2019 s say a state elects one party locally , but votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a presidential election .\nWhat happens if the state government overturns those results , citing \u201c fraud \u201d or \u201c irregularities , \u201d and sends a slate of electors that supports their candidate ?\nCan Congress overrule a state legislature ?\n\u201c It depends , \u201d said Republican Sen. Todd Young , one senator involved in talks .\nAppearing to realize this wasn \u2019 t the most reassuring answer , Young added , \u201c Sorry , but it \u2019 s true , though.\n\u201d Trump has spent the last weeks railing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any Republican supportive of the process .\n\u201c The reason they want it changed is because they now say they don \u2019 t want the Vice President to have the right to ensure an honest vote , \u201d he said in a statement on Feb. 4 .\n\u201c In other words , I was right and everyone knows it.\n\u201d Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said that the reform bill , whenever it gets written , is expected to go through regular order .\nThat means going before the Senate Rules Committee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo one involved is giving a timeline for when even the first stage could be complete .\n\u201c A lot of discussion , research going on , \u201d said Angus King , the lead Democrat on the bipartisan talks .",

        "content": "A # MeToo era bill that will change how private companies handle sexual harassment and assault is headed to President Joe Biden \u2019 s desk after easily passing the Senate on Thursday .\nThe bill will end the use of a secretive legal process known as forced arbitration , which prevents many people from bringing sexual misconduct claims to court .\nIt was first introduced in 2017 at the height of the # MeToo movement by Sens .\nKirsten Gillibrand , a New York Democrat , and Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican .\nHistorically , forced arbitration has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process keeps claims out of the public and offers no structure for appeals , often silencing people who are harmed \u2014 but it \u2019 s a common requirement of many employment contracts .\nThe legislation marks a significant change to employment law by giving people the option of suing in state , tribal , or federal courts and retroactively invalidating contracts that eliminated the possibility of doing so .\nAhead of the Senate vote , Gillibrand said in a statement that the legislation was \u201c one of the most significant workplace reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage now \u2014 four years after it was first introduced \u2014 to Democrats being in the majority .\nBut the bill has significant and rare bipartisan support .\nIt passed the Senate on Thursday by voice vote , meaning the chamber skipped the long process of each member voting individually , a sign of how uncontroversial the legislation has become .\nThe bill passed the House of Representatives in a similar fashion earlier this week by a 335\u201397 vote .\n\u201c For far too long , Americans who experience sexual harassment or assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows , compelled to sign secretive arbitration agreements that protect their employers from liability and often shield offenders from accountability , \u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement following the bill \u2019 s passage .\n\u201c Employers prevail over their workers in more than 98 percent of these cases \u2014 and by 2024 , an estimated 80 percent of private-sector workers will be forced into these unfair agreements.\n\u201d Moments of significant bipartisan agreement in Congress have been few and far between since Biden took office last year , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in large part to the 60-vote filibuster threshold to move most legislation through the Senate , which is currently split 50-50 .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of publicity about sexual harassment and about people not getting justice through the present process , \u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley , an Iowa Republican , told Politico ahead of the vote .\n\u201c I \u2019 m quite an arbitration supporter , but in this particular instance , I think that it \u2019 s easy to cover up sexual harassment , sexual assault .\n\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot issue right now too , and ought to be.\n\u201d The issue has attracted Republican support in part due to the advocacy of former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson , who filed a lawsuit against former Fox News chair Roger Ailes in 2016 .\n\u201c We would have sued Fox News instead of only suing Roger Ailes , \u201d Carlson told the New York Times about how forced arbitration affected her case .\n\u201c I did not understand the ramifications of that clause .\nTons of people have no idea they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it was first introduced , however , in part to attract Republican support , including focusing specifically on sexual assault and harassment , rather than other employment issues , including discrimination .\nBut some supporters , including Sen. Elizabeth Warren , hope it \u2019 s a first step toward eliminating mandatory arbitration across the board .\n\u201c I have wanted to get rid of mandatory arbitration and all consumer contracts for well over a decade , \u201d she told Politico .\n\u201c We \u2019 re getting action right now because it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no mistake : Mandatory arbitration is a way for giant corporations to squeeze consumers and make sure that they don \u2019 t have access to the courts , to exercise their legal rights .\n\u201d",

        "content": "Full House star and stand-up comedian Bob Saget died unexpectedly last month at age 65 in a hotel in Florida , while he was traveling for a comedy tour .\nThe cause of death was accidental blunt trauma to the head .\nSaget \u201c hit the back of his head on something , thought nothing of it and went to sleep , \u201d according to a statement from his family .\nAn autopsy report that the Orange County Medical Examiner \u2019 s Office sent to BuzzFeed News said he had fractures at the base of his skull and near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fall .\nDrugs and alcohol were not factors in Saget \u2019 s death , the report said , but clonazepam \u2014 a medication used to treat seizures , panic attacks , and anxiety \u2014 as well as the antidepressant trazodone were found in his system .\nSaget also was positive for COVID , according to the report .\nHis death is a reminder that potentially life-threatening brain injuries can happen to anyone and they are not always easy to spot , Dr. Gregory Zipfel , head of the department of neurosurgery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c This is a time to pause and think about how big a problem head trauma is , both severe head traumas like this and also milder forms that have cumulative effects over time , and the toll that that takes on our communities , \u201d Zipfel said .\nTraumatic brain injuries killed nearly 61,000 people in the US in 2019 alone , according to the CDC \u2014 that \u2019 s about 166 people a day .\nThere were more than 223,000 TBI-related hospitalizations in 2018 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head injuries are dangerous because they are often unpredictable and invisible to the naked eye .\nLet \u2019 s say you slip in your bathtub and hit your head .\nYou \u2019 ll definitely feel some pain and see a bruise or bump appear .\nBut while your brain has neurons that sense and feel pain to your skin and surrounding tissues , you can \u2019 t feel any injury to the brain itself , Zipfel said .\nSo even a serious injury may not feel dramatic ; you could still be conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .\nOver time , however , things can change .\nAs 30 minutes to an hour passes , internal bleeding can occur , which can build pressure \u201c in such a way that you don \u2019 t have a lot of pain associated with it , \u201d Zipfel said .\nBecause the brain is trapped inside the confines of the bony skull , it has nowhere to expand when it swells .\n\u201c When you injure your brain , it \u2019 s not like when you injure your ankle and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Dr. Beth McQuiston , a neurologist who conducts research for the global health technology company Abbott in Chicago , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t see it .\nSo it becomes an invisible injury lurking beneath the surface that can be extremely dangerous.\n\u201d All it takes is a minor blow to a very specific part of the brain to cause serious damage , Zipfel said .\nFor example , hits to the temple region are particularly dangerous because that \u2019 s where the thinnest part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right where an important blood vessel , your middle meningeal artery , sits .\nSo even low-impact injuries like falls can fracture the skull , tear the artery , and cause a brain bleed , he said .\nNot to mention , symptoms may look the same following mild or severe traumas , both Zipfel and McQuiston said .\nWhat symptoms to look for and what to do Generally , there are three main types of traumatic brain injuries : mild ( concussions ) , moderate , and severe .\nConcussions are typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits to the body that make your brain suddenly bounce or twist in your skull , which can damage brain cells .\nThey \u2019 re usually not life-threatening and can resolve at home \u2014 after you \u2019 ve been diagnosed .\nZipfel said it \u2019 s better to take caution and get a diagnosis than letting a potentially dangerous injury worsen under the radar .\nSome serious symptoms to look out for include : \u2022 Enlarged pupils , especially if it \u2019 s just one \u2022 A headache that progressively gets worse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior , such as confusion , agitation , or restlessness Otherwise , be wary of sensitivity to light , blurred vision , ringing in the ears , and change in sleep patterns after a head injury .\nBesides being aware of these common symptoms after head trauma , it \u2019 s always a good idea to observe anyone who injured their head for at least a couple of hours , Zipfel said .\n\u201c People can initially look good , but something severe or something serious may be happening inside their skull in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become apparent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And if there 's nobody around , things can go bad fairly quickly.\n\u201d Zipfel added , \u201c If no one is around to see that this person is changing and getting sleepier , then the bleeding can continue until they go into a coma and die.\n\u201d It \u2019 s generally safe to go to sleep after a mild concussion or relatively minor head injury , but \u201c it is often prudent \u201d to wake someone up every couple of hours to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms , Zipfel said .\nThis is especially important in the first few hours after an injury .\nHowever , you should get any symptoms checked by a doctor before going to sleep , especially if you live alone .\nZipfel said you can call your primary care doctor first or go straight to an emergency department depending on how you feel .\nHe recommends calling 911 after a head injury that occurs in a high-speed accident such as falling off a ladder or experiencing a motorcycle or car crash .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses consciousness or has a seizure right after an injury , or if they develop neurological symptoms such as confusion , lethargy , weakness , numbness , or vision and speech problems , Zipfel said .\nEven minor injuries can manifest symptoms weeks later ( though the more serious the trauma , the more likely you \u2019 ll experience severe symptoms that clearly warrant a trip to the hospital ) .\nZipfel said neurologists are often able to treat these delayed consequences from mild brain injuries and prevent further damage .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the difference between a minor or major head injury , it \u2019 s best to seek help .\nSome people are at higher risk than others Older adults , particularly those over 75 , are at greater risk from seemingly minor head injuries ; they have the highest rates of TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths , the CDC says .\nThat \u2019 s because they are more prone to slips and falls and have smaller brains than younger adults , meaning there \u2019 s more room for the brain and its blood vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull .\nAnother reason why older adults are more likely to experience head trauma is that they are more likely to be taking blood thinners , such as warfarin ( sold as Coumadin ) , aspirin , clopidogrel ( Plavix ) , and rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ) .\nThese medications can increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following any trauma , which means you could have a pretty mild head injury , but have a very severe bleed if you are taking blood thinners , Zipfel said .\nSome groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military members and veterans , survivors of domestic violence , people of color , people experiencing homelessness , and those in correctional facilities , are more likely to die from and have long-term consequences after traumatic brain injuries , the CDC says .\nThe reasons revolve around poor access to healthcare , a history of substance abuse , and higher rates of car crashes and other injuries .\nMen are also about two times more likely to require hospitalization than women , and three times more likely to die from traumatic brain injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their high injury risks , simple slips and falls account for nearly half of brain injury\u2013related hospitalizations .\nCar crashes , assaults , and firearm-related suicide are other common causes of head trauma .\nWhile some accidents are unavoidable , there are steps you can take to reduce the risk of a traumatic brain injury .\n\u201c Prevention is key , \u201d McQuiston said .\nMake sure you wear helmets when appropriate and necessary , and use handrails on stairs , especially when outdoors in the winter .\n\u201c The best injury is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d she said .",

        "content": "\u201c I feel like I 'm an informed person , but in the heat of the moment , it 's just hard to be like , let 's use logic right now , \u201d a 22-year-old college student living in Michigan told me over the phone last month , talking about her sporadic use of condoms during sex .\n\u201c I know what I should be doing , but I still do n't do that.\n\u201d Like many of the people interviewed for this story , this individual wanted to remain anonymous .\nThe student , who is studying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sex with two regular partners , hooking up about two or three times a week .\n\u201c With one of them , I always use a condom , and with one of them I do n't .\nThe one that I am not using a condom with , we have an agreement that we will use a condom with everyone else , if we 're hooking up with other people , but between us it 's OK , \u201d she said .\nHer sentiments echo how other people I spoke to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining , according to the Guttmacher Institute .\nThe institute published a report last April documenting adolescent trends around safe sex from 2006 to 2019 .\nThe report found that contraceptive use overall had increased , but consistent condom use declined over time .\nThis particular progression isn \u2019 t only unique among teens , as older adults have started flouting condom use as well , per a Cosmopolitan article from 2019 .\nThe gradual shift away from condoms as the primary means of protection against STIs and pregnancy aligns with individual stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSome chalked up their irregular condom use to forgetfulness or a creeping angst about spoiling a hot and steamy moment , while others said it simply just feels better to participate in sex without a barrier .\nBut with declining condom use comes a steady increase in STIs .\n`` Though 2021 case numbers for sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) are still being collected , there are worrying signs ; initial reports show that gonorrhea cases have climbed , and the CDC reports that there were more cases of infants with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' reported National Geographic in January .\nThe upward tick \u201c of STDs increased overall and across many groups , \u201d according to the CDC , but \u201c hit racial and ethnic minority groups , gay and bisexual men , and youth the hardest , \u201d the report stated , and STI rates among Black people \u201c were 5\u20138 times that of non-Hispanic White people.\n\u201d And gay and bisexual men made up nearly half \u201c of all 2019 primary and secondary syphilis cases.\n\u201d The pandemic has exacerbated the problems .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus growing of medical professionals becoming burned out , things like STI care and testing have fallen by the wayside .\n\u201c Many people have a limited understanding of STI given lacking sexual health education in the US .\nCondom use , a core component of preventing STIs , is also in decline amid already low rates , \u201d according to a Guardian article from last October .\nBuzzFeed News published a callout in early January asking readers about their safe sex habits .\nThousands of participants responded , with a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToward the end of our phone conversation , the Michigan-based engineering student said she had \u201c been researching rates of infection \u201d and was \u201c getting more and more worried.\n\u201d Though she has two consistent sexual partners at the moment , she says moving forward , \u201c when I am having sex with a new partner for the first time , I 'll definitely be a bit more like , maybe we should use a condom , maybe let 's both get tested before we decide on condomless sex.\n\u201d For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lack of adequate sex education made them reluctant to use condoms regularly .\n\u201c I grew up mostly Christian , so I really did n't learn anything about sex until I was in like ninth grade , \u201d a 23-year-old woman living in Ohio told me .\n\u201c And we did n't really have any discussions [ about sex ] with my parents .\nI did n't really have a sex-based health class either , \u201d she said .\nConsequently , she learned about sex from peers or from watching porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent of the time , though she is currently voluntarily celibate .\nIn college , she remembered using condoms \u201c religiously \u201d with an ex-boyfriend , and once rushed to take a Plan B pill after the condom broke .\nBut as she got older , her sexual interests evolved .\nShe entered a dominant/submissive relationship with a guy who had a breeding fetish .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bHe kind of introduced me to that , and I never really used one with anyone else after him , \u201d she said .\nWhile her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied up with specific kinks , as well as the fact that she has not yet knowingly contracted an STI , she did say there \u2019 s also a bit of reluctance for fear of turning the guy off .\n\u201c I do n't wan na put too much pressure on it .\nI do n't wan na ruin the moment , \u201d she said .\nThis echoes how Colleen , 24 , feels , too .\n\u201c I think back to my most recent partner , and the first time we slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not ask him about a condom , and I think a lot of it stems from fear of rejection , \u201d she said .\nFor Colleen , standing her ground can be difficult in the bedroom because of past encounters that she described as \u201c nonconsensual , \u201d telling me , \u201c So now I just have this fear of bringing [ condom use ] up with people and I know better .\nThat 's the thing , like , I know better .\nAnd I 100 % know that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have serious consequences for me and any future partners down the road , but in the moment I find it really hard to say , \u2018 Hey , this is my body and I 'm not gon na let you do anything with it.\n\u2019 \u201d On the subject of feeling comfortable expressing your sexual boundaries , Raquel Savage , 31 , a therapist , sex worker , and educator , said a great entry point would be identifying and interrogating systemic constraints that make one feel as if broaching the topic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the reason that a woman would feel uncomfortable advocating for herself with her cishet male partner ?\nThat 's patriarchy , misogyny , that 's purity culture , that 's whorephobia , \u201d she said during our video call .\n\u201c That 's all these systems at play that we have been socialized into make us feel uncomfortable , because realistically , we ought to not feel uncomfortable saying , \u2018 I do n't want this .\nI do want this.\n\u2019 \u201d How your family either engaged or decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informs the way you may navigate those topics as you get older .\n\u201c That can often \u2014 and often does \u2014 lead to some kind of a trauma or negative experience that is compounded with the societal , and the cultural shit , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And then it becomes like , \u2018 Well , when I was a kid , I tried to advocate for myself in this way and I got yelled at , so I have this really ugly , uncomfortable body experience that I wan na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means just going along with the thing , I 'll go along with the thing.\n\u2019 \u201d So there \u2019 s a trifold way of looking at this specific kind of discomfort in the bedroom \u2014 cultural , interpersonal , and traumatic .\nAnd if the person or people you \u2019 re sleeping with typify those things , it \u2019 s understandable why advocating for oneself would seem daunting .\n\u201c It \u2019 s scary , it \u2019 s too much , \u201d Savage said , but ultimately getting over this requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c feel ethical and safe and reciprocal , and that all of that is just so much fucking work so most of us end up in relationships where that \u2019 s just not happening.\n\u201d New York City sex therapist Stephen Snyder , author of Love Worth Making : How to Have Ridiculously Great Sex in a Long-Lasting Relationship , told me via email , \u201c If you 're not feeling secure enough to insist he use a condom , then you probably should n't be in bed with him.\n\u201d He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered a bit of advice about making the most of the moment .\n\u201c Let 's be honest \u2014 when you recall the best sex of your life , was physical sensation the biggest ingredient ?\nMore likely , it was the sight and feel of your partner 's body \u2014 or the erotic connection between the two of you , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c Do n't let the presence of a condom distract you from those other things !\n\u201d Eddie , 24 , lives in Seattle and works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he never had a problem with wearing condoms during sex \u2014 in fact , he would often be \u201c adamant \u201d about using contraception .\nEddie , who identifies as pansexual , said he \u2019 s never experienced men who wouldn \u2019 t sleep with him because of his dedicated condom use , \u201c but there were certain guys who would say , \u2018 Oh , I really prefer , you know , not to use a condom , you know ?\n\u2019 But I would say , \u2018 You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with other people , but not with me.\n\u2019 \u201d Fear of contracting an STI compelled his allegiance to condoms , but since he started taking PrEP , an HIV prevention medicine , he \u2019 s begun having a more relaxed approach to sex .\n( PrEP does not prevent people from contracting other STIs . )\n\u201c I did not have sex for the first time without a condom until like , two and a half years ago , \u201d said Eddie , who is now in a monogamous relationship .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c one particular sexual partner who I was just like ridiculously attracted to , and they preferred to not use a condom .\nFinally I said , all right , and that was the first person I ever had sex with without a condom , and I was like , \u2018 Whoa , this is an entirely different experience , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nShould he ever become single again , Eddie said he doesn \u2019 t know if he would immediately adopt his former condom-wearing habits .\nAnother person I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who opted to stay anonymous because of the industry they work in , started using PrEP last summer and described it as \u201c revolutionary.\n\u201d They continued : \u201c I do n't second guess as much as I used to , \u201d they said , recalling how they would be \u201c sweating bullets \u201d before going to get tested .\nA regular condom user , they added that there was a time when they were so riddled with anxiety that they didn \u2019 t get tested for eight years , fearing what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated risks , \u201d now using condoms for penetrative sex , but not for fellatio .\n( It \u2019 s still possible to contract STIs from giving and receiving oral sex . )\n\u201c I 'm a firm believer [ of ] do n't swallow , unless you 're in love , \u201d they said .\nA 2018 New York Times opinion piece titled , \u201c The End of Safe Gay Sex ?\n\u201d noted a precipitous decline in condom use among gay men , per an Australian study that noted the sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2014 to 2017 .\n\u201c While the number of H.I.V.-negative men who are on PrEP increased to 24 percent from 2 percent , the rate of condom use decreased to 31 percent from 46 percent , \u201d the Times article outlined .\nAccording to a 2019 BMC Public Health report that analyzed condom practices among HIV-negative gay men in Vancouver , Canada , men were less likely to use condoms , citing , in part , the rise in popularity of bareback sex and the sense that barriers used during sex inhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that three decades of condom-based prevention messaging and interventions have caused safer sex fatigue or burnout , leading to inconsistent condom use .\nNew interventions that focus solely on condoms may be viewed as ineffective or unrealistic , and may therefore be rejected , particularly among older gay men who are tired of prevention messaging focused primarily or exclusively on condoms , \u201d the study said .\nBut with infections like antibiotic-resistant Gonorrhea , also called \u201c Super Gonorrhea , \u201d which is close to incurable , becoming more common among men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s still plenty reason to wrap up during sex .\nAnd if you \u2019 re someone who typically refrains from using condoms , you may want to consider talking to your primary care physician about getting an HPV vaccine , too .\nOf course , not all queer-identifying people have the same blas\u00e9 attitude toward condoms , even with the popularity of PrEP , which has helped many queer men overcome trepidation about sex .\nNick , 35 , works as a painter and lives in Brooklyn .\nHe uses condoms consistently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooking up a priority because of the pandemic .\nIn the past , he dealt with a minor health scare that turned out to be a learning experience for him .\nHe hooked up with a guy on the dating app Scruff and later discovered upon rereading his profile that he was HIV positive .\nNick said he \u201c didn \u2019 t freak out a ton \u201d and added that the two didn \u2019 t discuss their statuses prior to hooking up .\nHe spoke with a friend who allayed his worries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant to be HIV positive and have an undetectable viral load .\nThat means the virus is so low in a person \u2019 s body that it can \u2019 t be transmitted through sex .\n\u201c That totally changed my whole idea of somebody that was positive and my interaction [ with them ] , \u201d he said .\nNow when he does hook up , Nick said his approach to wearing condoms is mainly about prioritizing his own well-being .\n\u201c I 'm not interested in going back on my health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condom .\nIf they say no , great , I 'll find somebody else .\nI 'm not that hard up for sex , \u201d he said .\nWhile condoms have proven to be effective in protecting against STIs , some people simply don \u2019 t wear them \u2014 or ask their partners to \u2014 because they are uncomfortable .\n\u201c If I 'm in a long-term relationship , I wo n't use condoms , \u201d a woman named Audrey , 22 , living in Tennessee said .\nEven with proper lubricants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t seem to be compatible with her body .\n\u201c Condoms rub me raw , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I prefer to use a form of birth control and stick to one partner at a time .\nIt also doesn \u2019 t help that the first time I had sex with my current boyfriend , the condom got stuck inside of me and we had to get Plan B the next day.\n\u201d Like Audrey , Altair , a 33-year-old who lives in New Jersey , doesn \u2019 t particularly like condoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual partners desire it .\n\u201c Condoms are uncomfortable ; maybe I have n't found the right [ fit ] for me , or like the best condoms that could work , \u201d he said .\nWhile Altair , who identifies as ethically non-monogamous , knows the reason why he forgoes condom use \u2014 because it feels better and he has a network of established sexual partners whom he trusts \u2014 he believes the overall decline of protection could also be attributed to people simply not having as much sex nowadays .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have started periods of celibacy by choice , some people may be entering into monogamous relationships \u2014 or in monogamous sexual relationships \u2014 and they only have one partner and choose not [ to use ] condoms.\n\u201d There \u2019 s some research that backs this idea .\nFewer people are having sex these days .\n\u201c People now in their early 20s are two and a half times as likely to be abstinent as Gen Xers were at that age ; 15 percent report having had no sex since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 .\nAnd although fewer people are having sex , STIs have increased due to a few factors : One reason , of course , is condomless sex , but also because of \u201c sexual behaviors associated with opioid use and addiction , \u201d as well as cuts to funding from public health programs .\nSavage , the therapist , looked at it another way , attributing reports about diminished sexual activity among younger generations to the ways in which queer and trans folks have disrupted longheld conceptions about relationships and sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural expectations to figure out what feels more authentic and affirming for them , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Meaning me as a cis woman , no longer having to rely on marriage and a man in order to do anything , I can do whatever the fuck I want .\nAnd so that means that in order to have a man in my life , they essentially have to be a luxury and men are in no way a fucking luxury .\nSo I 'm not gon na have 'em around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , period.\n\u201d Even with STI infection rates trending in a direction that concerns medical professionals , a fair amount of people seem OK with some level of risk .\nWhen asked about her thoughts on condoms seemingly going out of style , the anonymous Ohio resident who was introduced to the breeding kink from a former partner told me , \u201c I think people should do as I say and not as I do , for sure.\n\u201d The best approach , according to Savage , would be focusing on harm reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around sex practices to understand that there is no safe sex removes the moral piece to it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c No one \u2019 s having safe sex \u2014 we can all attempt to have safer sex , though.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "Full House star and stand-up comedian Bob Saget died unexpectedly last month at age 65 in a hotel in Florida , while he was traveling for a comedy tour .\nThe cause of death was accidental blunt trauma to the head .\nSaget \u201c hit the back of his head on something , thought nothing of it and went to sleep , \u201d according to a statement from his family .\nAn autopsy report that the Orange County Medical Examiner \u2019 s Office sent to BuzzFeed News said he had fractures at the base of his skull and near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fall .\nDrugs and alcohol were not factors in Saget \u2019 s death , the report said , but clonazepam \u2014 a medication used to treat seizures , panic attacks , and anxiety \u2014 as well as the antidepressant trazodone were found in his system .\nSaget also was positive for COVID , according to the report .\nHis death is a reminder that potentially life-threatening brain injuries can happen to anyone and they are not always easy to spot , Dr. Gregory Zipfel , head of the department of neurosurgery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c This is a time to pause and think about how big a problem head trauma is , both severe head traumas like this and also milder forms that have cumulative effects over time , and the toll that that takes on our communities , \u201d Zipfel said .\nTraumatic brain injuries killed nearly 61,000 people in the US in 2019 alone , according to the CDC \u2014 that \u2019 s about 166 people a day .\nThere were more than 223,000 TBI-related hospitalizations in 2018 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head injuries are dangerous because they are often unpredictable and invisible to the naked eye .\nLet \u2019 s say you slip in your bathtub and hit your head .\nYou \u2019 ll definitely feel some pain and see a bruise or bump appear .\nBut while your brain has neurons that sense and feel pain to your skin and surrounding tissues , you can \u2019 t feel any injury to the brain itself , Zipfel said .\nSo even a serious injury may not feel dramatic ; you could still be conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .\nOver time , however , things can change .\nAs 30 minutes to an hour passes , internal bleeding can occur , which can build pressure \u201c in such a way that you don \u2019 t have a lot of pain associated with it , \u201d Zipfel said .\nBecause the brain is trapped inside the confines of the bony skull , it has nowhere to expand when it swells .\n\u201c When you injure your brain , it \u2019 s not like when you injure your ankle and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Dr. Beth McQuiston , a neurologist who conducts research for the global health technology company Abbott in Chicago , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t see it .\nSo it becomes an invisible injury lurking beneath the surface that can be extremely dangerous.\n\u201d All it takes is a minor blow to a very specific part of the brain to cause serious damage , Zipfel said .\nFor example , hits to the temple region are particularly dangerous because that \u2019 s where the thinnest part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right where an important blood vessel , your middle meningeal artery , sits .\nSo even low-impact injuries like falls can fracture the skull , tear the artery , and cause a brain bleed , he said .\nNot to mention , symptoms may look the same following mild or severe traumas , both Zipfel and McQuiston said .\nWhat symptoms to look for and what to do Generally , there are three main types of traumatic brain injuries : mild ( concussions ) , moderate , and severe .\nConcussions are typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits to the body that make your brain suddenly bounce or twist in your skull , which can damage brain cells .\nThey \u2019 re usually not life-threatening and can resolve at home \u2014 after you \u2019 ve been diagnosed .\nZipfel said it \u2019 s better to take caution and get a diagnosis than letting a potentially dangerous injury worsen under the radar .\nSome serious symptoms to look out for include : \u2022 Enlarged pupils , especially if it \u2019 s just one \u2022 A headache that progressively gets worse or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior , such as confusion , agitation , or restlessness Otherwise , be wary of sensitivity to light , blurred vision , ringing in the ears , and change in sleep patterns after a head injury .\nBesides being aware of these common symptoms after head trauma , it \u2019 s always a good idea to observe anyone who injured their head for at least a couple of hours , Zipfel said .\n\u201c People can initially look good , but something severe or something serious may be happening inside their skull in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become apparent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And if there 's nobody around , things can go bad fairly quickly.\n\u201d Zipfel added , \u201c If no one is around to see that this person is changing and getting sleepier , then the bleeding can continue until they go into a coma and die.\n\u201d It \u2019 s generally safe to go to sleep after a mild concussion or relatively minor head injury , but \u201c it is often prudent \u201d to wake someone up every couple of hours to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms , Zipfel said .\nThis is especially important in the first few hours after an injury .\nHowever , you should get any symptoms checked by a doctor before going to sleep , especially if you live alone .\nZipfel said you can call your primary care doctor first or go straight to an emergency department depending on how you feel .\nHe recommends calling 911 after a head injury that occurs in a high-speed accident such as falling off a ladder or experiencing a motorcycle or car crash .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses consciousness or has a seizure right after an injury , or if they develop neurological symptoms such as confusion , lethargy , weakness , numbness , or vision and speech problems , Zipfel said .\nEven minor injuries can manifest symptoms weeks later ( though the more serious the trauma , the more likely you \u2019 ll experience severe symptoms that clearly warrant a trip to the hospital ) .\nZipfel said neurologists are often able to treat these delayed consequences from mild brain injuries and prevent further damage .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the difference between a minor or major head injury , it \u2019 s best to seek help .\nSome people are at higher risk than others Older adults , particularly those over 75 , are at greater risk from seemingly minor head injuries ; they have the highest rates of TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths , the CDC says .\nThat \u2019 s because they are more prone to slips and falls and have smaller brains than younger adults , meaning there \u2019 s more room for the brain and its blood vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull .\nAnother reason why older adults are more likely to experience head trauma is that they are more likely to be taking blood thinners , such as warfarin ( sold as Coumadin ) , aspirin , clopidogrel ( Plavix ) , and rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ) .\nThese medications can increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following any trauma , which means you could have a pretty mild head injury , but have a very severe bleed if you are taking blood thinners , Zipfel said .\nSome groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military members and veterans , survivors of domestic violence , people of color , people experiencing homelessness , and those in correctional facilities , are more likely to die from and have long-term consequences after traumatic brain injuries , the CDC says .\nThe reasons revolve around poor access to healthcare , a history of substance abuse , and higher rates of car crashes and other injuries .\nMen are also about two times more likely to require hospitalization than women , and three times more likely to die from traumatic brain injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their high injury risks , simple slips and falls account for nearly half of brain injury\u2013related hospitalizations .\nCar crashes , assaults , and firearm-related suicide are other common causes of head trauma .\nWhile some accidents are unavoidable , there are steps you can take to reduce the risk of a traumatic brain injury .\n\u201c Prevention is key , \u201d McQuiston said .\nMake sure you wear helmets when appropriate and necessary , and use handrails on stairs , especially when outdoors in the winter .\n\u201c The best injury is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d she said .",

        "content": "\u201c I feel like I 'm an informed person , but in the heat of the moment , it 's just hard to be like , let 's use logic right now , \u201d a 22-year-old college student living in Michigan told me over the phone last month , talking about her sporadic use of condoms during sex .\n\u201c I know what I should be doing , but I still do n't do that.\n\u201d Like many of the people interviewed for this story , this individual wanted to remain anonymous .\nThe student , who is studying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sex with two regular partners , hooking up about two or three times a week .\n\u201c With one of them , I always use a condom , and with one of them I do n't .\nThe one that I am not using a condom with , we have an agreement that we will use a condom with everyone else , if we 're hooking up with other people , but between us it 's OK , \u201d she said .\nHer sentiments echo how other people I spoke to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining , according to the Guttmacher Institute .\nThe institute published a report last April documenting adolescent trends around safe sex from 2006 to 2019 .\nThe report found that contraceptive use overall had increased , but consistent condom use declined over time .\nThis particular progression isn \u2019 t only unique among teens , as older adults have started flouting condom use as well , per a Cosmopolitan article from 2019 .\nThe gradual shift away from condoms as the primary means of protection against STIs and pregnancy aligns with individual stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSome chalked up their irregular condom use to forgetfulness or a creeping angst about spoiling a hot and steamy moment , while others said it simply just feels better to participate in sex without a barrier .\nBut with declining condom use comes a steady increase in STIs .\n`` Though 2021 case numbers for sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) are still being collected , there are worrying signs ; initial reports show that gonorrhea cases have climbed , and the CDC reports that there were more cases of infants with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' reported National Geographic in January .\nThe upward tick \u201c of STDs increased overall and across many groups , \u201d according to the CDC , but \u201c hit racial and ethnic minority groups , gay and bisexual men , and youth the hardest , \u201d the report stated , and STI rates among Black people \u201c were 5\u20138 times that of non-Hispanic White people.\n\u201d And gay and bisexual men made up nearly half \u201c of all 2019 primary and secondary syphilis cases.\n\u201d The pandemic has exacerbated the problems .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus growing of medical professionals becoming burned out , things like STI care and testing have fallen by the wayside .\n\u201c Many people have a limited understanding of STI given lacking sexual health education in the US .\nCondom use , a core component of preventing STIs , is also in decline amid already low rates , \u201d according to a Guardian article from last October .\nBuzzFeed News published a callout in early January asking readers about their safe sex habits .\nThousands of participants responded , with a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToward the end of our phone conversation , the Michigan-based engineering student said she had \u201c been researching rates of infection \u201d and was \u201c getting more and more worried.\n\u201d Though she has two consistent sexual partners at the moment , she says moving forward , \u201c when I am having sex with a new partner for the first time , I 'll definitely be a bit more like , maybe we should use a condom , maybe let 's both get tested before we decide on condomless sex.\n\u201d For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lack of adequate sex education made them reluctant to use condoms regularly .\n\u201c I grew up mostly Christian , so I really did n't learn anything about sex until I was in like ninth grade , \u201d a 23-year-old woman living in Ohio told me .\n\u201c And we did n't really have any discussions [ about sex ] with my parents .\nI did n't really have a sex-based health class either , \u201d she said .\nConsequently , she learned about sex from peers or from watching porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent of the time , though she is currently voluntarily celibate .\nIn college , she remembered using condoms \u201c religiously \u201d with an ex-boyfriend , and once rushed to take a Plan B pill after the condom broke .\nBut as she got older , her sexual interests evolved .\nShe entered a dominant/submissive relationship with a guy who had a breeding fetish .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bHe kind of introduced me to that , and I never really used one with anyone else after him , \u201d she said .\nWhile her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied up with specific kinks , as well as the fact that she has not yet knowingly contracted an STI , she did say there \u2019 s also a bit of reluctance for fear of turning the guy off .\n\u201c I do n't wan na put too much pressure on it .\nI do n't wan na ruin the moment , \u201d she said .\nThis echoes how Colleen , 24 , feels , too .\n\u201c I think back to my most recent partner , and the first time we slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not ask him about a condom , and I think a lot of it stems from fear of rejection , \u201d she said .\nFor Colleen , standing her ground can be difficult in the bedroom because of past encounters that she described as \u201c nonconsensual , \u201d telling me , \u201c So now I just have this fear of bringing [ condom use ] up with people and I know better .\nThat 's the thing , like , I know better .\nAnd I 100 % know that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have serious consequences for me and any future partners down the road , but in the moment I find it really hard to say , \u2018 Hey , this is my body and I 'm not gon na let you do anything with it.\n\u2019 \u201d On the subject of feeling comfortable expressing your sexual boundaries , Raquel Savage , 31 , a therapist , sex worker , and educator , said a great entry point would be identifying and interrogating systemic constraints that make one feel as if broaching the topic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the reason that a woman would feel uncomfortable advocating for herself with her cishet male partner ?\nThat 's patriarchy , misogyny , that 's purity culture , that 's whorephobia , \u201d she said during our video call .\n\u201c That 's all these systems at play that we have been socialized into make us feel uncomfortable , because realistically , we ought to not feel uncomfortable saying , \u2018 I do n't want this .\nI do want this.\n\u2019 \u201d How your family either engaged or decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informs the way you may navigate those topics as you get older .\n\u201c That can often \u2014 and often does \u2014 lead to some kind of a trauma or negative experience that is compounded with the societal , and the cultural shit , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And then it becomes like , \u2018 Well , when I was a kid , I tried to advocate for myself in this way and I got yelled at , so I have this really ugly , uncomfortable body experience that I wan na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means just going along with the thing , I 'll go along with the thing.\n\u2019 \u201d So there \u2019 s a trifold way of looking at this specific kind of discomfort in the bedroom \u2014 cultural , interpersonal , and traumatic .\nAnd if the person or people you \u2019 re sleeping with typify those things , it \u2019 s understandable why advocating for oneself would seem daunting .\n\u201c It \u2019 s scary , it \u2019 s too much , \u201d Savage said , but ultimately getting over this requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c feel ethical and safe and reciprocal , and that all of that is just so much fucking work so most of us end up in relationships where that \u2019 s just not happening.\n\u201d New York City sex therapist Stephen Snyder , author of Love Worth Making : How to Have Ridiculously Great Sex in a Long-Lasting Relationship , told me via email , \u201c If you 're not feeling secure enough to insist he use a condom , then you probably should n't be in bed with him.\n\u201d He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered a bit of advice about making the most of the moment .\n\u201c Let 's be honest \u2014 when you recall the best sex of your life , was physical sensation the biggest ingredient ?\nMore likely , it was the sight and feel of your partner 's body \u2014 or the erotic connection between the two of you , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c Do n't let the presence of a condom distract you from those other things !\n\u201d Eddie , 24 , lives in Seattle and works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he never had a problem with wearing condoms during sex \u2014 in fact , he would often be \u201c adamant \u201d about using contraception .\nEddie , who identifies as pansexual , said he \u2019 s never experienced men who wouldn \u2019 t sleep with him because of his dedicated condom use , \u201c but there were certain guys who would say , \u2018 Oh , I really prefer , you know , not to use a condom , you know ?\n\u2019 But I would say , \u2018 You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with other people , but not with me.\n\u2019 \u201d Fear of contracting an STI compelled his allegiance to condoms , but since he started taking PrEP , an HIV prevention medicine , he \u2019 s begun having a more relaxed approach to sex .\n( PrEP does not prevent people from contracting other STIs . )\n\u201c I did not have sex for the first time without a condom until like , two and a half years ago , \u201d said Eddie , who is now in a monogamous relationship .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c one particular sexual partner who I was just like ridiculously attracted to , and they preferred to not use a condom .\nFinally I said , all right , and that was the first person I ever had sex with without a condom , and I was like , \u2018 Whoa , this is an entirely different experience , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nShould he ever become single again , Eddie said he doesn \u2019 t know if he would immediately adopt his former condom-wearing habits .\nAnother person I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who opted to stay anonymous because of the industry they work in , started using PrEP last summer and described it as \u201c revolutionary.\n\u201d They continued : \u201c I do n't second guess as much as I used to , \u201d they said , recalling how they would be \u201c sweating bullets \u201d before going to get tested .\nA regular condom user , they added that there was a time when they were so riddled with anxiety that they didn \u2019 t get tested for eight years , fearing what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated risks , \u201d now using condoms for penetrative sex , but not for fellatio .\n( It \u2019 s still possible to contract STIs from giving and receiving oral sex . )\n\u201c I 'm a firm believer [ of ] do n't swallow , unless you 're in love , \u201d they said .\nA 2018 New York Times opinion piece titled , \u201c The End of Safe Gay Sex ?\n\u201d noted a precipitous decline in condom use among gay men , per an Australian study that noted the sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2014 to 2017 .\n\u201c While the number of H.I.V.-negative men who are on PrEP increased to 24 percent from 2 percent , the rate of condom use decreased to 31 percent from 46 percent , \u201d the Times article outlined .\nAccording to a 2019 BMC Public Health report that analyzed condom practices among HIV-negative gay men in Vancouver , Canada , men were less likely to use condoms , citing , in part , the rise in popularity of bareback sex and the sense that barriers used during sex inhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that three decades of condom-based prevention messaging and interventions have caused safer sex fatigue or burnout , leading to inconsistent condom use .\nNew interventions that focus solely on condoms may be viewed as ineffective or unrealistic , and may therefore be rejected , particularly among older gay men who are tired of prevention messaging focused primarily or exclusively on condoms , \u201d the study said .\nBut with infections like antibiotic-resistant Gonorrhea , also called \u201c Super Gonorrhea , \u201d which is close to incurable , becoming more common among men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s still plenty reason to wrap up during sex .\nAnd if you \u2019 re someone who typically refrains from using condoms , you may want to consider talking to your primary care physician about getting an HPV vaccine , too .\nOf course , not all queer-identifying people have the same blas\u00e9 attitude toward condoms , even with the popularity of PrEP , which has helped many queer men overcome trepidation about sex .\nNick , 35 , works as a painter and lives in Brooklyn .\nHe uses condoms consistently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooking up a priority because of the pandemic .\nIn the past , he dealt with a minor health scare that turned out to be a learning experience for him .\nHe hooked up with a guy on the dating app Scruff and later discovered upon rereading his profile that he was HIV positive .\nNick said he \u201c didn \u2019 t freak out a ton \u201d and added that the two didn \u2019 t discuss their statuses prior to hooking up .\nHe spoke with a friend who allayed his worries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant to be HIV positive and have an undetectable viral load .\nThat means the virus is so low in a person \u2019 s body that it can \u2019 t be transmitted through sex .\n\u201c That totally changed my whole idea of somebody that was positive and my interaction [ with them ] , \u201d he said .\nNow when he does hook up , Nick said his approach to wearing condoms is mainly about prioritizing his own well-being .\n\u201c I 'm not interested in going back on my health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condom .\nIf they say no , great , I 'll find somebody else .\nI 'm not that hard up for sex , \u201d he said .\nWhile condoms have proven to be effective in protecting against STIs , some people simply don \u2019 t wear them \u2014 or ask their partners to \u2014 because they are uncomfortable .\n\u201c If I 'm in a long-term relationship , I wo n't use condoms , \u201d a woman named Audrey , 22 , living in Tennessee said .\nEven with proper lubricants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t seem to be compatible with her body .\n\u201c Condoms rub me raw , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I prefer to use a form of birth control and stick to one partner at a time .\nIt also doesn \u2019 t help that the first time I had sex with my current boyfriend , the condom got stuck inside of me and we had to get Plan B the next day.\n\u201d Like Audrey , Altair , a 33-year-old who lives in New Jersey , doesn \u2019 t particularly like condoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual partners desire it .\n\u201c Condoms are uncomfortable ; maybe I have n't found the right [ fit ] for me , or like the best condoms that could work , \u201d he said .\nWhile Altair , who identifies as ethically non-monogamous , knows the reason why he forgoes condom use \u2014 because it feels better and he has a network of established sexual partners whom he trusts \u2014 he believes the overall decline of protection could also be attributed to people simply not having as much sex nowadays .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have started periods of celibacy by choice , some people may be entering into monogamous relationships \u2014 or in monogamous sexual relationships \u2014 and they only have one partner and choose not [ to use ] condoms.\n\u201d There \u2019 s some research that backs this idea .\nFewer people are having sex these days .\n\u201c People now in their early 20s are two and a half times as likely to be abstinent as Gen Xers were at that age ; 15 percent report having had no sex since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 .\nAnd although fewer people are having sex , STIs have increased due to a few factors : One reason , of course , is condomless sex , but also because of \u201c sexual behaviors associated with opioid use and addiction , \u201d as well as cuts to funding from public health programs .\nSavage , the therapist , looked at it another way , attributing reports about diminished sexual activity among younger generations to the ways in which queer and trans folks have disrupted longheld conceptions about relationships and sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural expectations to figure out what feels more authentic and affirming for them , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Meaning me as a cis woman , no longer having to rely on marriage and a man in order to do anything , I can do whatever the fuck I want .\nAnd so that means that in order to have a man in my life , they essentially have to be a luxury and men are in no way a fucking luxury .\nSo I 'm not gon na have 'em around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , period.\n\u201d Even with STI infection rates trending in a direction that concerns medical professionals , a fair amount of people seem OK with some level of risk .\nWhen asked about her thoughts on condoms seemingly going out of style , the anonymous Ohio resident who was introduced to the breeding kink from a former partner told me , \u201c I think people should do as I say and not as I do , for sure.\n\u201d The best approach , according to Savage , would be focusing on harm reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around sex practices to understand that there is no safe sex removes the moral piece to it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c No one \u2019 s having safe sex \u2014 we can all attempt to have safer sex , though.\n\u201d \u25cf",

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nCondoms get a bad rap .\nDespite being around since the dawn of time ( well , modern condoms were invented in the 1800s ) and being a pretty reliable and safe way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been on the decline since roughly 2015 .\nI think most people would agree that the trend isn \u2019 t a positive one .\nCDC data suggest that STI rates hit an all-time high in 2019 for the sixth consecutive year in a row .\nOne of the reasons people may not be that into condoms is they are using the wrong type or size .\nYes , fit matters !\n( When was a one-size-fits-all approach ever a good idea for anything ? )\nIf a condom is too small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn the other hand , if it \u2019 s too large , there could be spillage or it may simply fall off .\nAccording to Melissa White , founder and CEO of fit-focused condom purveyor Lucky Bloke , only about 50 % of people with penises should be wearing a medium or standard-fit condom , which is about 90 % of what you \u2019 ll see on the shelves in conventional retail stores .\nAnother 30 % to 35 % require a snugger , more secure fit , and the remaining 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger size or Magnum condom .\nAnd no , condom size is not actually related to length , so put away your ruler or measuring tape .\nInstead , grab an empty toilet paper roll and measure for girth ( if it fits nicely in there , you \u2019 re likely a standard fit ; too tight and you should go larger , too much space and you should go smaller ) .\nThough it may be tempting for people with penises to grab a box of Magnums more as a status symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise against using condoms that are too big .\nPeople probably aren \u2019 t talking enough about condoms All too often sex education in general is a fail in the US , and that can certainly apply to knowledge about condoms , said Ashley Townes , a postdoctoral research associate at the CDC who focuses on sexual health .\nA stigma against buying the correct size condom may be particularly pervasive in teenage boys who simply don \u2019 t know any better .\nTownes , who is a former sex educator , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they need to know about choosing and using the right condom .\n\u201c You get one lesson to talk about contraceptives , and condoms are only a sliver of all the different contraceptives available , \u201d she said .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t have a lot of time to dive into it , so it can be challenging even as an educator to really go in depth about , How do you choose one that fits ?\nHow do you choose one that feels good for you ?\n\u201d And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about condom use is more than some people get , including those at schools where sex ed isn \u2019 t covered at all .\n\u201c Sex education isn \u2019 t mandatory across the United States , \u201d said \u00c9va Goicochea , founder of sexual wellness company Maude .\n\u201c Even if it is , it 's not always medically accurate , and so what ends up happening is that when they 're teaching about condoms , often they \u2019 re not able to open them in the classroom , so it 's harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Condom use has fallen out of the conversation a bit as focus has shifted to consent and sexual assault prevention , social demographer Laura Lindberg said .\n\u201c What we see in sex education and health education more generally is as certain topics rise in importance , there \u2019 s less space and time to talk about other things that used to be discussed because nobody 's expanding the amount of time , \u201d she said .\nA 2021 study in the Journal of Adolescent Health of 2,291 college students found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about consent than condom use or STI prevention .\n\u201c In my era , I was literally the first group who was getting the , Here \u2019 s a banana .\nHere \u2019 s a condom .\nThis is important because everyone around you could have HIV , \u201d Lindberg said .\n\u201c Now the first talk you get your freshman week on a college campus is about consent .\nBut they \u2019 re not doing two talks , so you don \u2019 t get space to talk about condoms.\n\u201d Finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perk of wearing a properly fitting condom is that it \u2019 s also going to feel better , likely for both partners .\n\u201c A common response we get is that using a condom will interfere with your pleasure , \u201d said Lindberg , who is also a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute , referring to the answers they get on their surveys .\n\u201c I think we need to be honest that it may interfere with people \u2019 s sexual pleasure , and here are steps you can take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right fit , Lindberg had one main piece of advice when it comes to making sex with condoms feel better : \u201c Lubricate , lubricate , lubricate.\n\u201d Townes agreed , noting that people often don \u2019 t want to use lubricant even though it can increase pleasure and reduce the feeling of the condom itself .\nWhite added that using lubricant also makes the condom more effective from a safety perspective .\n\u201c Latex condoms in particular are naturally drying , \u201d White said .\n\u201c So your receiving partner is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes the condom less safe.\n\u201d White recommends putting a few drops inside the condom and a generous amount on the outside to help both parties feel more pleasure and reduce friction to maximize safety .\nTownes also recommended trying compatible sex toys with your condom to spice things up , like a vibrating cock ring or an external vibrator that won \u2019 t interfere with the effectiveness of the condom .\nPeople are still using condoms , just not often enough Despite the fact that there \u2019 s less consistency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , Lindberg feels it \u2019 s important to recognize how far we \u2019 ve come in making condoms more socially acceptable .\nHer research shows that condom use at first intercourse has gone up dramatically , and 9 out of 10 sexually active teenagers have used a condom at some point .\n\u201c There aren \u2019 t declines in contraceptive use overall , \u201d Lindberg said .\n\u201c So young people are replacing condom use with other methods of contraception , and I think that speaks to the increased availability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pill.\n\u201d As great as it is that there are so many other contraceptive methods available , only condoms can protect against both STIs and pregnancy .\nDepending on your access to healthcare , condoms may also be easier to get since they don \u2019 t require a prescription and are relatively inexpensive .\nThat can be particularly appealing if you \u2019 re not having consistent sex and don \u2019 t want to be on a contraceptive all the time .\nAnd on a very basic level , they make sex less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Lindberg assured that the best way for a condom to fail is to not use it .\n( In truth , condoms are 98 % effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly . )\nIf you find you have barriers to buying condoms IRL , such as a fear of judgmental drugstore clerks or running into your old English teacher , this guide should help .\nAll of these condoms are available online for an embarrassment-free buying experience .",

MeToo had not been able to resolve \u2014 questions that felt necessary to explore if the movement was to lead to enduring cultural transformation .\nHunter certainly didn \u2019 t think abusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims had any obligation to them whatsoever .\nBut she did wonder if it was ever possible for someone who was capable of such terrible acts to change .\nIt was impossible to know , since almost none of the prominent men outed by #

MeToo story to come out in many ways.\n\u201d She laid into him for what she saw as sexual entitlement and publicly masked misogyny : \u201c You have some serious fucking reckoning to do.\n\u201d \u201c I will continue to have many ups and downs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote .\n\u201c You 're still my friend , and I still love you , but I am not going to be an easy shoulder for you.\n\u201d \u201c I had to sleep on this one , \u201d Schneiderman wrote Hunter back the next day .\n\u201c I accept the hard shoulder role you are uniquely qualified to play , but it may take a little time before I can fully lean into this conversation .\nYou may not care about my feelings , but I am still reeling from the multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mental state is pretty fragile right now .\nAlthough I go way up and way down .\nI know the path forward includes taking full responsibility for everything I have done , but I am only capable of taking things day by day right now .\nI hope you can understand that , even if you think less of me because of it .\nHaving said all that , this conversation is very important to me .\nI hope we can take it up again when I am better equipped to engage.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ had over the next three and a half years \u2014 on the phone , in emails , over meals , and during long walks through Manhattan \u2019 s Riverside Park \u2014 were at times revelatory .\nThey helped Hunter better understand the harm men had done to her and how it had shaped her .\nAnd they helped Schneiderman understand that he did not deserve to hold a position of power again .\nIt took Hunter a few days to contact him .\n\u201c I went around in torturous loops , \u201d she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any point in spending my energy talking to Eric when I could be supporting women instead.\n\u201d Schneiderman \u2019 s press team had advance notice that the New Yorker was investigating his relationships , but he had told them not to worry \u2014 back then he was so \u201c oblivious , \u201d he said , that he didn \u2019 t feel his personal life would interest a journalist .\nHe knew he had problems : alcoholism , workaholism , maybe even narcissism .\nBut although as attorney general he had pursued high-profile #

MeToo .\nHunter had told Schneiderman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his therapist but impossible to deal with after a meeting with his lawyers .\nSo he devised a code word , \u201c criminal defense loop , \u201d that Hunter could wield whenever Schneiderman started arguing his case , after which they would move on to more productive ground .\nOver those first six months , Schneiderman completed an in-patient alcohol rehabilitation program , committed to sobriety , and started weekly therapy .\nHe had always been drawn to meditation , and he revived his practice and Dharma study , which allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It helped me to be in my body , to get out of my jabbering mind , and to really be able to identify difficult feelings , and instead of running away from them , be able to sit with them , \u201d he said .\nDuring our interviews , he sometimes fingered the 108 Buddhist mala beads he wears on his wrist to remind him \u201c to breathe.\n\u201d He and Hunter also started a \u201c feminist book club , \u201d discussing challenging work by writers from New York magazine \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Wilber .\nThey read Moira Donegan on why she started the \u201c Shitty Media Men \u201d list and Tarana Burke on # MeToo \u2019 s origin story .\nThey cast a wide net , covering the Black women left out of the suffrage movement , sexual abuse in the Catholic Church , and research on false memories .\nBy approaching these topics intellectually , Schneiderman began to understand \u201c the scope of misogyny and sexism and patriarchy , how it permeated my life , how it permeated our culture , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to apply what he was learning to himself .\nIn September , four months after Schneiderman resigned , millions of Americans watched as Christine Blasey Ford testified that she had been sexually assaulted by prospective Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when they were both in high school .\nAs they continued their wide-ranging discussions , Hunter , on edge from the hearings , started to feel that Schneiderman was showing more interest in the possibilities for abusers \u2019 redemption than in victims \u2019 pain .\n\u201c I know that the hardest part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think what I think , \u201d she wrote him in an email .\n\u201c And you want me to understand your experience .\nBut for fuck 's sake , it 's been all about men and their pain and anger for centuries .\nI 'm over it .\nEvery woman I know is over it.\n\u201d \u201c I appreciate your honesty , but what you seem to be saying is that right now you can \u2019 t muster up much in the way of compassion for men , \u201d Schneiderman wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nDoes that feel ok ?\nIt sounds like for you it does .\nBut in my experience , you can \u2019 t hear or see someone you have no compassion for , which probably makes any meaningful dialogue impossible.\n\u201d \u201c To have you ask how I feel about not having compassion for men ... just wow , \u201d Hunter wrote back .\n\u201c You may not want to talk to me right now .\nBut what I may have meant is I don \u2019 t want to talk to you.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exhausted by how \u201c the public credibility \u201d of the # MeToo movement \u201c seems to rest on individual stories.\n\u201d The \u201c constant cross examination of every woman \u2019 s account \u201d made it difficult for her to be interested in the nuances of Schneiderman \u2019 s own experiences or care at all about the feelings of men in his position .\n\u201c I \u2019 m terrified that one tiny chink will make the whole thing come tumbling down , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c The Kavanaugh hearings felt like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026 I don \u2019 t think you understand the collective experience of women who \u2019 ve been abused by men and had our experiences be invisible for our entire lives until a year ago .\nHow could you ?\n\u201d Schneiderman replied , thanking Hunter for her honesty and conceding that he had been ignoring that collective experience : \u201c Looking at women \u2019 s stories as the tales of individuals with agency ( and who must take responsibility for their own roles in any situation ) misses the overwhelming , crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every situation.\n\u201d At first , Schneiderman felt disgusted by Kavanaugh , who struck him as \u201c the big WASP-y jock \u201d who would have bullied him in school .\nBut in therapy , he had been unpacking his upbringing \u2014 private school in Manhattan , followed by Amherst and Harvard \u2014 and his relationships with his mother and his father , who , like Schneiderman , was a powerful attorney and a \u201c functional alcoholic.\n\u201d When he later read an essay on Kavanaugh \u2019 s privilege , the similarities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharper focus .\nThey both had \u201c benefitted from the American patriarchal structure , \u201d Schneiderman said , and were both brought up to think they could \u201c make the rules and therefore break the rules and prosper.\n\u201d When I asked Hunter why she kept speaking to Schneiderman even when he upset her , she cited dialogues like the one above .\nShe was intrigued by his willingness to be honest with himself \u2014 even if it was a slow and difficult process \u2014 and to keep reading what made him uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cathartic .\n\u201c I felt like so much of the # MeToo conversation was just women talking to other women and talking about what we wanted to say to men who had done bad things , and now I could actually say it to his face and he had to listen to every word , \u201d Hunter said .\nMeanwhile , Manning Barish and Selvaratnam were writing through their trauma \u2014 Manning Barish on social media , Selvaratnam for the New York Times .\nSelvaratnam began working on a memoir about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrast between Schneiderman \u2019 s actions and his do-gooder persona .\n\u201c His outward-facing spirituality was a mask for the torment beneath the surface , \u201d she later wrote .\n\u201c His outward-facing feminism was a mask for his misogyny.\n\u201d Hunter and Schneiderman were exploring similar themes together .\nWhen they read \u201c The Rub of Rough Sex \u201d by Chelsea Summers \u2014 an essay that focused on Schneiderman himself and considered how progressive men have used \u201c kink as a cover for abuse \u201d \u2014 he felt seen in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The essay \u201c really got me to look at my sexual activity , and say , OK , is there something deeper going on here that I \u2019 m missing ?\n\u201d Schneiderman recalled .\nAfter months of reading and thinking , he said he realized he had sought to control the women in his life and felt entitled to sex not just because of the sexist culture he grew up in but because of the authority that his job conferred .\nEspecially during the Trump years , when he gained national stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean of power and privilege , but I didn \u2019 t even know I was underwater , \u201d Schneiderman told me .\nThe more his star rose , the more arrogant he became .\n\u201c Power creeps up on you , \u201d he said .\nHe came to see that it wasn \u2019 t right to have engaged in what he had thought of as \u201c rough sex \u201d without clear rules in advance , not to mention ongoing communication and trust \u2014 and that he \u201c had consent wrong \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing to them , that meant they were OK with it .\n\u201c While in some senses that may be legal consent , it \u2019 s not ethical consent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And the ethical consent requires me to make an inquiry into what a partner really wants and really likes .\nAnd I \u2019 m very much ashamed of the fact that I gave that so little thought.\n\u201d In November 2018 , Madeline Singas , then the district attorney who Cuomo had appointed to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to pursue charges against him , citing \u201c legal impediments , \u201d including statutes of limitation .\nIt was a huge relief for Schneiderman .\n\u201c I was able to get out of my \u2018 criminal defense loop , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nThe public statement he put out was very different from his previous denials .\n\u201c I recognize that District Attorney Singas \u2019 decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong , \u201d it said .\n\u201c I accept full responsibility for my conduct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the impact it had on them .\nAfter spending time in a rehab facility , I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed .\nI apologize for any and all pain that I have caused , and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me . ''\nThat recognition was not lost on the women who said Schneiderman had abused them .\nSelvaratnam later wrote that she found the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even further .\n\u201c I feel completely vindicated by Eric Schneiderman \u2019 s admission that he engaged in the abuse to which he subjected me and the other women , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted .\n\u201c I wish him well in his recovery process.\n\u201d In early 2019 , Schneiderman was at lunch with a friend who called # MeToo overreaching and intolerant and questioned whether there was anything men could ever do to appease their accusers .\nActually , Schneiderman told them , Time \u2019 s Up had recently offered simple instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform your behavior .\nMake restitution to those harmed .\n( His friend confirmed this exchange . )\nAfterward , Schneiderman emailed Hunter about the conversation .\n\u201c Oddly enough , I found myself in the role of defending the movement , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c It felt kind of good to be able to lay all of this out .\nAnd I felt somewhat calmer.\n\u201d Along with meditation , Schneiderman had been consulting with his rabbi , J. Rolando Matalon , who told me that there \u2019 s biblical precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAn elaborate priestly ritual described in the Book of Leviticus reintegrated people who had been separated from their community due to contagious skin diseases .\nMatalon thought that , similarly , there could be a ritual that would publicly reintroduce people who had been excluded because of moral offenses if they were able to make amends .\nHowever , Matalon counseled Schneiderman , Judaism makes clear \u201c that a pariah can not return without a serious process of repentance and personal transformation , and directly apologizing to those he has harmed.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction .\nAll she had ever wanted from Hoffman was for him to acknowledge and empathize with his accusers \u2019 claims .\nBut \u201c in the absence of any genuine apology , we were out for vengeance , \u201d she said .\nHunter and Schneiderman looked together for meaningful examples of apologies that sought to actively make things right , not just to individual survivors but to the larger public , but couldn \u2019 t find many .\nOne study of over 200 statements by people accused of sexual misconduct amid the # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included an apology of any kind .\nAnother found that even the highest-quality apologies \u2014 detailed , not defensive \u2014 left the public dissatisfied .\nThere was a single apology that Hunter and Schneiderman found inspiring .\nIn January 2018 , TV writer Dan Harmon apologized on his podcast to his former employee Megan Ganz , saying he realized he lacked respect for women , had hidden behind his progressive politics , and never would have changed his behavior if she hadn \u2019 t accused him publicly on Twitter .\nAfterward , Ganz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneiderman was nervous he \u2019 d get it wrong .\nAfter he graduated earlier that year from a meditation class in Manhattan , the studio posted a photo of its newly certified students .\nWhen Manning Barish found out , she was outraged .\nSchneiderman was \u201c an untreated sexual assaulter and predator , \u201d she tweeted .\n\u201c He has no business teaching meditation .\nHe has not even been rehabilitated yet.\n\u201d He told me he had no intention of teaching and that the class was for anyone who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the story , and he was banned from the studio .\nThe experience made him feel like it would be easier to stay silent .\n\u201c My male friends often say to me : don \u2019 t even try to apologize , \u201d he once wrote to Hunter in an email .\n\u201c Whatever you say won \u2019 t be enough .\nYou will be attacked all over again and will have admitted to wrongdoing.\n\u201d Hunter encouraged Schneiderman to push past his anxieties \u2014 if he had apologized earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing progress , maybe the meditation class incident would never have happened .\nIn February , she suggested he start with Selvaratnam .\nThe night before , Hunter and Schneiderman had discussed Selvaratnam \u2019 s New York Times article , in which she said he had \u201c tested \u201d her by giving her little slaps .\n\u201c I have never heard you understand Tanya \u2019 s point of view like you did last night , \u201d Hunter wrote to him .\n\u201c How it \u2019 s a slippery slope of giving in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for the sake of staying with someone.\n\u201d \u201c I am now clear : I am very , very sorry for my appalling conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote in a draft version .\n\u201c I have a lot more work to do and amends to make , but I felt that it was important to reach out as a work in progress and to tell you that I am sorry.\n\u201d It was brutally hard to face up to what he had done , he wrote , and for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what he did with any clarity .\n\u201c None of this excuses my conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c From the beginning , I bossed you around .\nMaybe lightheartedly at first , but over time , I became less and less considerate and more and more nasty and controlling .\nAnd I pushed you to go along with things in bed that I now recognize you did not want to do.\n\u201d He never asked her whether their relationship worked for her , he wrote .\nInstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply ashamed .\n\u201c I have a long way to go , but I am committed to doing the work I need to do to become a better , healthier human being , and to ensure that I never behave the way I did with you with anyone else ever again , \u201d he wrote .\nHunter was overcome after she read the draft .\n\u201c I think I \u2019 ve been honest about how emotional this is for me \u2014 that the weight I \u2019 m putting on this apology goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote to him .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not saying that \u2019 s right or healthy , but I haven \u2019 t spent the last 10 months talking to you so intensely just because you \u2019 re my friend and I care about you \u2026 Having you get to the point where you could even write a letter like this is all I have wanted since we started talking .\nFor you to GET IT .\nAs I said ... in many ways you \u2019 re a stand-in for all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , because they won \u2019 t even try.\n\u201d Schneiderman never sent the letter .\nShortly after he drafted it , he learned that a state committee that investigates wrongdoing by Manhattan attorneys was conducting a probe into the allegations against him .\nIf the First Department appellate court found him responsible , he could be suspended or disbarred from practicing law .\nThat wasn \u2019 t a consequence Schneiderman was willing to accept .\nHe shelved his apology plans , convinced that if he reached out to the women it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lawyered up again , reentering the \u201c criminal defense loop \u201d he had worked so hard to overcome .\nRecords show that his attorney \u2019 s response to the committee did not reflect Schneiderman \u2019 s newfound understanding of consent .\nInstead , it reiterated his old arguments , protesting that his \u201c consensual relationships with his romantic partners in the confines of his bedroom \u201d should not be subject to further scrutiny .\nWhen Schneiderman was deposed for the investigation in January 2020 , he said Manning Barish and Selvaratnam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c dominant-submissive \u201d sex life , according to the committee records .\n\u201c I \u2019 m confident that neither one of them ever after sex or the next morning said \u2018 I don \u2019 t like what you did , don \u2019 t do that anymore \u2019 or any words to that effect , \u201d he said .\nAll those emails and texts that Schneiderman had worked hard not to dwell on were deployed in an attempt to discredit the women .\nHe said in his deposition that , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her life , she had fought to stay together when he broke things off , \u201c devastated \u201d to lose him not \u201c just as a romantic partner but as a teammate for her career.\n\u201d He argued that the New Yorker was wrong that the anonymous woman in the Hamptons rebuffed him after he slapped her , and that the magazine had failed to report that they had stayed in \u201c warm and flirtatious \u201d touch afterward .\nAs for Manning Barish , the records cited emails from her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him she loved him , missed him , and wanted to marry him .\nReferencing allegations that former New York governor Eliot Spitzer had choked a woman , she said she felt sorry he hadn \u2019 t met the right girl yet .\n\u201c Too soon for you to give him my number ?\n\u201d she quipped .\nUntil Schneiderman , \u201c no one ever understood my darkness , \u201d she wrote to him .\n\u201c I miss that part of me being controlled and celebrated.\n\u201d In his deposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrite statement he had released after the DA declined to prosecute .\nFor the women who said he \u2019 d abused them , that statement had been validating and vindicating .\nFor Schneiderman himself , it had represented crucial progress forward on his path toward self-improvement .\nBut it was the committee \u2019 s job to assess whether he had committed professional misconduct and should be disciplined , not to ensure the women got what they needed to heal .\nAnd to the committee lawyer , it seemed , that statement was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf his relationships with the women were as \u201c vibrant and consensual \u201d as he had just described , the lawyer asked , \u201c for what were you apologizing ?\n\u201d Hunter grew frustrated as she watched from the sidelines .\nShe still held out hope that one day Schneiderman would make full amends to the women , and that they would get the reckoning she herself had never received .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bI was vengeful \u201d toward Hoffman , \u201c but mostly I wanted all of us to stop hurting so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the adversarial legal proceeding made that hope an increasingly distant possibility .\nExperts in restorative justice insist there is a better approach in these types of situations .\nWhether administered through the legal system or outside of it , restorative justice is at its heart a community-based process that seeks to honor the needs of those hurt and ensure accountability for those who caused them harm , instead of asking who broke the law and how they should be penalized .\n\u201c It can be difficult to come to the realization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished in order for you to heal , \u201d said Sonya Shah , a restorative justice practitioner who is also a sexual assault survivor .\nThe practitioners who spoke with me said restorative justice , which is inspired by the conflict-resolution practices of some Indigenous cultures , is most crucial for people in marginalized communities .\nThey are the ones who face disproportionate punishment in the justice system , not privileged white men ( or in Schneiderman \u2019 s case , a privileged white former law enforcement officer ) .\nBut some restorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a closer look at # MeToo .\nThey said they understood the valid anger the movement unleashed , but that harsher retribution wasn \u2019 t the answer .\nResearch has shown prison does not effectively rehabilitate offenders , and the criminal justice system can retraumatize and disempower survivors , who often say they want their assailant to change but not to be locked up .\nMost sexual assault and harassment claims are never even referred for prosecution \u2014 which is more evidence that other options are needed , experts said .\nFiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it doesn \u2019 t necessarily prevent them from getting another job where they hurt more people .\nPublic shaming can spread awareness , but on its own it provides no road map for ending the cycles of harm , experts said , especially since plenty of the most high-profile # MeToo men seem like they \u2019 re doing just fine and have no regrets other than getting called out .\nPractitioners said restorative justice doesn \u2019 t let offenders off easy \u2014 in order to participate in the process , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept responsibility \u2014 and that it always centers survivors \u2019 needs .\nIt also allows the parties to make progress even if they don \u2019 t agree on all of the facts .\nShah said she has counseled men who committed sexual assault who were willing to apologize for some but not all of what they were accused of , and she has worked with survivors who felt that a partial apology could still be beneficial .\n\u201c We come down so hard on people when they cause harm that they learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is to remain silent , defend themselves , and admit nothing , \u201d said Erika Sasson , a former litigator and long-standing restorative justice practitioner .\nThis fundamental right to a defense is important in court , she said , but it makes it harder for people to be honest with each other and break the silence and secrecy of abuse .\nTelling the truth , she said , takes \u201c courage , communication , and support.\n\u201d In April 2021 , the First Department appellate court issued its ruling : Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , conditioned upon continuing therapy and supervision .\nThe decision included a statement of facts that didn \u2019 t substantiate all of the claims against him , but Schneiderman admitted that he had slapped Selvaratnam and Manning Barish and placed his hands on their necks and applied pressure without first obtaining consent .\nHe also admitted to emotionally abusing them , and to slapping the anonymous woman from the Hamptons twice .\nThese avowals , however , were part of a legal settlement that didn \u2019 t seem to fully satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women learned that Schneiderman had tried to protect himself by blaming them .\nThe validation they expressed after his earlier statement of remorse was demolished .\n\u201c I initially chose not to participate in this after having to keep testifying over and over again , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted after the decision .\n\u201c But they went after Eric anyway , and he chose to compose a complete lie of a narrative to defend himself , and discredit me .\nSo I fought back.\n\u201d Schneiderman , she wrote , \u201c belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her book about Schneiderman at the time , and she spoke about how she believed in redemption if an abuser \u201c acknowledges the harm that they have committed and does the hard work to root out their abusive behavior.\n\u201d But the one-year suspension was \u201c not enough \u201d to reform Schneiderman , she said .\nThough they were not in contact , she was confident he hadn \u2019 t changed , because she had heard from other professed victims of his , including someone who said he abused her after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selvaratnam \u2019 s book , her evidence for that claim was an email she received from a woman who said Schneiderman was a \u201c sadist and predator \u201d who had \u201c targeted \u201d her .\nShe didn \u2019 t include more details .\nSelvaratnam acknowledged that she did not speak to the woman and couldn \u2019 t \u201c vouch for her experience.\n\u201d Still , the note felt like \u201c an affirmation.\n\u201d \u201c It also sparked the first time I felt rage toward Eric , \u201d she wrote .\nWhen I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allegation and said he hadn \u2019 t been romantically involved with a woman since May 2018 .\nHe said Selvaratnam didn \u2019 t reach out to him before publishing her book or before repeating the claim to the press .\nAfter the ruling , the anonymous Hamptons woman identified herself as Danya Perry , a prominent attorney who used to work for the Southern District of New York .\nPerry told me she was horrified and distraught when Schneiderman slapped her during a romantic encounter after a party , and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , she said , it seemed like Schneiderman had genuinely misread the situation .\nHe told her he had dated other women who enjoyed being slapped , and she believed him when he said he had made a drunken mistake .\nBut when Perry heard that journalists were looking into a possible pattern , she decided to tell them about her experience .\nShe wasn \u2019 t interested in prosecuting Schneiderman , and at first she didn \u2019 t want any role in the committee proceeding either .\nLosing his job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learned that he had defended himself by minimizing the fact that he slapped her and exaggerating her forgiveness .\n\u201c If he had acknowledged and apologized , I would have said , Why do we need to punish this guy anymore ?\n\u201d she told me .\nPerry decided to cooperate .\nI also reached out to Jess McIntosh , who in 2018 wrote an essay for Elle about going on an unsettling date with Schneiderman in the early 2000s .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what happens to Eric Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have any power over the women of New York anymore , \u201d McIntosh said .\n\u201c I very much care about taking away power from people who don \u2019 t treat women as human beings and are somehow surprised that acting physically violent is wrong.\n\u201d She was skeptical and unimpressed when I told her about his conversations with Hunter .\n\u201c I hope he stays woke , \u201d she said , \u201c and I hope he stays quiet.\n\u201d None of the women who spoke out in 2018 seemed satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists .\nThe criminal justice system couldn \u2019 t address his harm .\nThe committee decision didn \u2019 t appease them , and in some ways the process seemed to make matters worse .\nPublic awareness pushed Schneiderman out of power but hasn \u2019 t held him accountable for whatever he has or hasn \u2019 t done since .\nOver the last four years , post- # MeToo efforts toward systemic progress have delivered mixed results .\nLawmakers have introduced a wave of carceral bills that some experts say will do more harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed by # MeToo have been replaced by women in the workplace \u2014 for example , Letitia James holds Schneiderman \u2019 s former position \u2014 but many others have scored new jobs and been nominated for fancy awards .\nMeanwhile , Time \u2019 s Up , the prominent anti-harassment charity that was supposed to tackle structural # MeToo issues , fell into crisis because of its ties to Cuomo .\nThere has been scant funding or research to determine how restorative justice might address these issues on a larger scale , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act has a proposal set aside for restorative practices .\nAlthough it \u2019 s been nearly three years since Schneiderman said he knew his path forward included amends and restitution , he still has yet to directly apologize to Selvaratnam , Manning Barish , or Perry .\nAs for restitution , he said , he plans on asking them for their input at some point in the future .\nHe hasn \u2019 t yet donated any of his own money for that purpose \u2014 \u201c I \u2019 ve been unemployed for three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of prospects , \u201d he said \u2014 but he has donated millions to charity from his old campaign fund , which he can only legally withdraw from for a few purposes .\n( He also returned money to donors who asked for it back and used some to cover his legal fees . )\nSelvaratnam has written that she thought it wrong of him to launder his reputation with charitable donations , while Manning Barish recently posted online that she thought it was disgusting he hadn \u2019 t donated more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer for progressive causes .\nBefore his license was suspended , he reached out to a number of groups , but no one wanted to be publicly associated with him , he said , not even a nonprofit that works with formerly incarcerated people who have committed murder and rape .\nEventually he realized that if he swore never to disclose his participation \u2014 if he \u201c worked like a blacklisted screenwriter in the 1950s \u201d \u2014 he could do interesting and useful work , such as advising organizations on legal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soup kitchen through his synagogue .\nRabbi Matalon told me that egoless community service is an important part of repentance : \u201c Atonement requires humility.\n\u201d Schneiderman insisted that his journey is ongoing and that he has already made meaningful amends to some people in his life .\nHe repeatedly said that he still hopes to do so to the women who participated in the committee investigation , but he can \u2019 t consider it until he gets his law license back \u2014 which could take a while , since he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up \u2014 lest he seem to be interfering in the legal process , since there might a hearing where the women could be called to testify .\nThere \u2019 s another factor , too .\nHe wouldn \u2019 t speak about the details of his sobriety , but in many programs , such as Alcoholics Anonymous , making amends is a step that comes later on , after committing a \u201c searching and fearless moral inventory \u201d of oneself .\nBut neither reason explains why he agreed to give me the draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or why he wouldn \u2019 t reach out to Perry even after I shared what she told me about her willingness to engage .\nDoes he deserve more patience and support , or is he a lost cause who , despite all claims to the contrary , cares only about restoring his public image ?\nIn the absence of any formalized process that might thoroughly hold Schneiderman accountable , he \u2019 s decided to try his luck in the court of public opinion , leaving it up to the readers of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .\n\u201c I \u2019 m trying to do the next right thing every day , \u201d Schneiderman said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m still working on fully understanding the consequences of my conduct.\n\u201d He added , \u201c I \u2019 ve come to understand that the process I \u2019 m in now requires me to take some time before making certain amends , and I \u2019 m respecting that process and trying to do it the right way.\n\u201d Part of her is afraid to go public with their friendship because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s an enabler or betraying the movement .\nWhen I saw them both recently and asked Schneiderman to triple-confirm he would never run for office again , which he did , she quipped to him , \u201c If you did , I wouldn \u2019 t be your friend , \u201d and then followed up with me to say that she was serious and hoped I \u2019 d include that in the story : \u201c Running for office again would be the worst possible move for a recovering narcissist !\n\u201d There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .\n\u201c How do we make men care ?\n\u201d she asked me one day .\n\u201c Does a fear of being disgraced have to be part of the incentive ?\n\u201d But as long as Schneiderman keeps digging into his past and trying to make things right for the future \u2014 and as long as their exchanges continue to fascinate and challenge her \u2014 she \u2019 ll take walks and share meals with him , continuing their conversations about sex , power , and abuse .\nHunter always felt that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Schneiderman for her own benefit as much as for his .\nBut in August 2021 , Hunter read a New York magazine article about a form of restorative justice called \u201c surrogate dialogue \u201d in which survivors work through their trauma not with their own assailant but with someone else who committed similar offenses .\nHunter was shocked to realize that she and Schneiderman had , in their own unsupervised , extremely ad hoc way , been engaging in a version of that .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate that word , \u201d Hunter said .\n\u201c But having this extended conversation with Eric over three years where I have seen him deepen his own understanding and also deepen mine in a way , has \u2014 in the absence of any genuine reckoning or apology I \u2019 m going to get from any man who has hurt me \u2014 been the next best thing.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "\u201c I feel like I 'm an informed person , but in the heat of the moment , it 's just hard to be like , let 's use logic right now , \u201d a 22-year-old college student living in Michigan told me over the phone last month , talking about her sporadic use of condoms during sex .\n\u201c I know what I should be doing , but I still do n't do that.\n\u201d Like many of the people interviewed for this story , this individual wanted to remain anonymous .\nThe student , who is studying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sex with two regular partners , hooking up about two or three times a week .\n\u201c With one of them , I always use a condom , and with one of them I do n't .\nThe one that I am not using a condom with , we have an agreement that we will use a condom with everyone else , if we 're hooking up with other people , but between us it 's OK , \u201d she said .\nHer sentiments echo how other people I spoke to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining , according to the Guttmacher Institute .\nThe institute published a report last April documenting adolescent trends around safe sex from 2006 to 2019 .\nThe report found that contraceptive use overall had increased , but consistent condom use declined over time .\nThis particular progression isn \u2019 t only unique among teens , as older adults have started flouting condom use as well , per a Cosmopolitan article from 2019 .\nThe gradual shift away from condoms as the primary means of protection against STIs and pregnancy aligns with individual stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSome chalked up their irregular condom use to forgetfulness or a creeping angst about spoiling a hot and steamy moment , while others said it simply just feels better to participate in sex without a barrier .\nBut with declining condom use comes a steady increase in STIs .\n`` Though 2021 case numbers for sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) are still being collected , there are worrying signs ; initial reports show that gonorrhea cases have climbed , and the CDC reports that there were more cases of infants with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' reported National Geographic in January .\nThe upward tick \u201c of STDs increased overall and across many groups , \u201d according to the CDC , but \u201c hit racial and ethnic minority groups , gay and bisexual men , and youth the hardest , \u201d the report stated , and STI rates among Black people \u201c were 5\u20138 times that of non-Hispanic White people.\n\u201d And gay and bisexual men made up nearly half \u201c of all 2019 primary and secondary syphilis cases.\n\u201d The pandemic has exacerbated the problems .\nWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus growing of medical professionals becoming burned out , things like STI care and testing have fallen by the wayside .\n\u201c Many people have a limited understanding of STI given lacking sexual health education in the US .\nCondom use , a core component of preventing STIs , is also in decline amid already low rates , \u201d according to a Guardian article from last October .\nBuzzFeed News published a callout in early January asking readers about their safe sex habits .\nThousands of participants responded , with a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nToward the end of our phone conversation , the Michigan-based engineering student said she had \u201c been researching rates of infection \u201d and was \u201c getting more and more worried.\n\u201d Though she has two consistent sexual partners at the moment , she says moving forward , \u201c when I am having sex with a new partner for the first time , I 'll definitely be a bit more like , maybe we should use a condom , maybe let 's both get tested before we decide on condomless sex.\n\u201d For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lack of adequate sex education made them reluctant to use condoms regularly .\n\u201c I grew up mostly Christian , so I really did n't learn anything about sex until I was in like ninth grade , \u201d a 23-year-old woman living in Ohio told me .\n\u201c And we did n't really have any discussions [ about sex ] with my parents .\nI did n't really have a sex-based health class either , \u201d she said .\nConsequently , she learned about sex from peers or from watching porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent of the time , though she is currently voluntarily celibate .\nIn college , she remembered using condoms \u201c religiously \u201d with an ex-boyfriend , and once rushed to take a Plan B pill after the condom broke .\nBut as she got older , her sexual interests evolved .\nShe entered a dominant/submissive relationship with a guy who had a breeding fetish .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bHe kind of introduced me to that , and I never really used one with anyone else after him , \u201d she said .\nWhile her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied up with specific kinks , as well as the fact that she has not yet knowingly contracted an STI , she did say there \u2019 s also a bit of reluctance for fear of turning the guy off .\n\u201c I do n't wan na put too much pressure on it .\nI do n't wan na ruin the moment , \u201d she said .\nThis echoes how Colleen , 24 , feels , too .\n\u201c I think back to my most recent partner , and the first time we slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not ask him about a condom , and I think a lot of it stems from fear of rejection , \u201d she said .\nFor Colleen , standing her ground can be difficult in the bedroom because of past encounters that she described as \u201c nonconsensual , \u201d telling me , \u201c So now I just have this fear of bringing [ condom use ] up with people and I know better .\nThat 's the thing , like , I know better .\nAnd I 100 % know that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have serious consequences for me and any future partners down the road , but in the moment I find it really hard to say , \u2018 Hey , this is my body and I 'm not gon na let you do anything with it.\n\u2019 \u201d On the subject of feeling comfortable expressing your sexual boundaries , Raquel Savage , 31 , a therapist , sex worker , and educator , said a great entry point would be identifying and interrogating systemic constraints that make one feel as if broaching the topic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the reason that a woman would feel uncomfortable advocating for herself with her cishet male partner ?\nThat 's patriarchy , misogyny , that 's purity culture , that 's whorephobia , \u201d she said during our video call .\n\u201c That 's all these systems at play that we have been socialized into make us feel uncomfortable , because realistically , we ought to not feel uncomfortable saying , \u2018 I do n't want this .\nI do want this.\n\u2019 \u201d How your family either engaged or decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informs the way you may navigate those topics as you get older .\n\u201c That can often \u2014 and often does \u2014 lead to some kind of a trauma or negative experience that is compounded with the societal , and the cultural shit , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And then it becomes like , \u2018 Well , when I was a kid , I tried to advocate for myself in this way and I got yelled at , so I have this really ugly , uncomfortable body experience that I wan na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means just going along with the thing , I 'll go along with the thing.\n\u2019 \u201d So there \u2019 s a trifold way of looking at this specific kind of discomfort in the bedroom \u2014 cultural , interpersonal , and traumatic .\nAnd if the person or people you \u2019 re sleeping with typify those things , it \u2019 s understandable why advocating for oneself would seem daunting .\n\u201c It \u2019 s scary , it \u2019 s too much , \u201d Savage said , but ultimately getting over this requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c feel ethical and safe and reciprocal , and that all of that is just so much fucking work so most of us end up in relationships where that \u2019 s just not happening.\n\u201d New York City sex therapist Stephen Snyder , author of Love Worth Making : How to Have Ridiculously Great Sex in a Long-Lasting Relationship , told me via email , \u201c If you 're not feeling secure enough to insist he use a condom , then you probably should n't be in bed with him.\n\u201d He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered a bit of advice about making the most of the moment .\n\u201c Let 's be honest \u2014 when you recall the best sex of your life , was physical sensation the biggest ingredient ?\nMore likely , it was the sight and feel of your partner 's body \u2014 or the erotic connection between the two of you , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c Do n't let the presence of a condom distract you from those other things !\n\u201d Eddie , 24 , lives in Seattle and works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he never had a problem with wearing condoms during sex \u2014 in fact , he would often be \u201c adamant \u201d about using contraception .\nEddie , who identifies as pansexual , said he \u2019 s never experienced men who wouldn \u2019 t sleep with him because of his dedicated condom use , \u201c but there were certain guys who would say , \u2018 Oh , I really prefer , you know , not to use a condom , you know ?\n\u2019 But I would say , \u2018 You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with other people , but not with me.\n\u2019 \u201d Fear of contracting an STI compelled his allegiance to condoms , but since he started taking PrEP , an HIV prevention medicine , he \u2019 s begun having a more relaxed approach to sex .\n( PrEP does not prevent people from contracting other STIs . )\n\u201c I did not have sex for the first time without a condom until like , two and a half years ago , \u201d said Eddie , who is now in a monogamous relationship .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c one particular sexual partner who I was just like ridiculously attracted to , and they preferred to not use a condom .\nFinally I said , all right , and that was the first person I ever had sex with without a condom , and I was like , \u2018 Whoa , this is an entirely different experience , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nShould he ever become single again , Eddie said he doesn \u2019 t know if he would immediately adopt his former condom-wearing habits .\nAnother person I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who opted to stay anonymous because of the industry they work in , started using PrEP last summer and described it as \u201c revolutionary.\n\u201d They continued : \u201c I do n't second guess as much as I used to , \u201d they said , recalling how they would be \u201c sweating bullets \u201d before going to get tested .\nA regular condom user , they added that there was a time when they were so riddled with anxiety that they didn \u2019 t get tested for eight years , fearing what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated risks , \u201d now using condoms for penetrative sex , but not for fellatio .\n( It \u2019 s still possible to contract STIs from giving and receiving oral sex . )\n\u201c I 'm a firm believer [ of ] do n't swallow , unless you 're in love , \u201d they said .\nA 2018 New York Times opinion piece titled , \u201c The End of Safe Gay Sex ?\n\u201d noted a precipitous decline in condom use among gay men , per an Australian study that noted the sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2014 to 2017 .\n\u201c While the number of H.I.V.-negative men who are on PrEP increased to 24 percent from 2 percent , the rate of condom use decreased to 31 percent from 46 percent , \u201d the Times article outlined .\nAccording to a 2019 BMC Public Health report that analyzed condom practices among HIV-negative gay men in Vancouver , Canada , men were less likely to use condoms , citing , in part , the rise in popularity of bareback sex and the sense that barriers used during sex inhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that three decades of condom-based prevention messaging and interventions have caused safer sex fatigue or burnout , leading to inconsistent condom use .\nNew interventions that focus solely on condoms may be viewed as ineffective or unrealistic , and may therefore be rejected , particularly among older gay men who are tired of prevention messaging focused primarily or exclusively on condoms , \u201d the study said .\nBut with infections like antibiotic-resistant Gonorrhea , also called \u201c Super Gonorrhea , \u201d which is close to incurable , becoming more common among men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s still plenty reason to wrap up during sex .\nAnd if you \u2019 re someone who typically refrains from using condoms , you may want to consider talking to your primary care physician about getting an HPV vaccine , too .\nOf course , not all queer-identifying people have the same blas\u00e9 attitude toward condoms , even with the popularity of PrEP , which has helped many queer men overcome trepidation about sex .\nNick , 35 , works as a painter and lives in Brooklyn .\nHe uses condoms consistently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooking up a priority because of the pandemic .\nIn the past , he dealt with a minor health scare that turned out to be a learning experience for him .\nHe hooked up with a guy on the dating app Scruff and later discovered upon rereading his profile that he was HIV positive .\nNick said he \u201c didn \u2019 t freak out a ton \u201d and added that the two didn \u2019 t discuss their statuses prior to hooking up .\nHe spoke with a friend who allayed his worries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant to be HIV positive and have an undetectable viral load .\nThat means the virus is so low in a person \u2019 s body that it can \u2019 t be transmitted through sex .\n\u201c That totally changed my whole idea of somebody that was positive and my interaction [ with them ] , \u201d he said .\nNow when he does hook up , Nick said his approach to wearing condoms is mainly about prioritizing his own well-being .\n\u201c I 'm not interested in going back on my health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condom .\nIf they say no , great , I 'll find somebody else .\nI 'm not that hard up for sex , \u201d he said .\nWhile condoms have proven to be effective in protecting against STIs , some people simply don \u2019 t wear them \u2014 or ask their partners to \u2014 because they are uncomfortable .\n\u201c If I 'm in a long-term relationship , I wo n't use condoms , \u201d a woman named Audrey , 22 , living in Tennessee said .\nEven with proper lubricants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t seem to be compatible with her body .\n\u201c Condoms rub me raw , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I prefer to use a form of birth control and stick to one partner at a time .\nIt also doesn \u2019 t help that the first time I had sex with my current boyfriend , the condom got stuck inside of me and we had to get Plan B the next day.\n\u201d Like Audrey , Altair , a 33-year-old who lives in New Jersey , doesn \u2019 t particularly like condoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual partners desire it .\n\u201c Condoms are uncomfortable ; maybe I have n't found the right [ fit ] for me , or like the best condoms that could work , \u201d he said .\nWhile Altair , who identifies as ethically non-monogamous , knows the reason why he forgoes condom use \u2014 because it feels better and he has a network of established sexual partners whom he trusts \u2014 he believes the overall decline of protection could also be attributed to people simply not having as much sex nowadays .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have started periods of celibacy by choice , some people may be entering into monogamous relationships \u2014 or in monogamous sexual relationships \u2014 and they only have one partner and choose not [ to use ] condoms.\n\u201d There \u2019 s some research that backs this idea .\nFewer people are having sex these days .\n\u201c People now in their early 20s are two and a half times as likely to be abstinent as Gen Xers were at that age ; 15 percent report having had no sex since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 .\nAnd although fewer people are having sex , STIs have increased due to a few factors : One reason , of course , is condomless sex , but also because of \u201c sexual behaviors associated with opioid use and addiction , \u201d as well as cuts to funding from public health programs .\nSavage , the therapist , looked at it another way , attributing reports about diminished sexual activity among younger generations to the ways in which queer and trans folks have disrupted longheld conceptions about relationships and sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural expectations to figure out what feels more authentic and affirming for them , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Meaning me as a cis woman , no longer having to rely on marriage and a man in order to do anything , I can do whatever the fuck I want .\nAnd so that means that in order to have a man in my life , they essentially have to be a luxury and men are in no way a fucking luxury .\nSo I 'm not gon na have 'em around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , period.\n\u201d Even with STI infection rates trending in a direction that concerns medical professionals , a fair amount of people seem OK with some level of risk .\nWhen asked about her thoughts on condoms seemingly going out of style , the anonymous Ohio resident who was introduced to the breeding kink from a former partner told me , \u201c I think people should do as I say and not as I do , for sure.\n\u201d The best approach , according to Savage , would be focusing on harm reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around sex practices to understand that there is no safe sex removes the moral piece to it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c No one \u2019 s having safe sex \u2014 we can all attempt to have safer sex , though.\n\u201d \u25cf",

Matheny , cofounder of Soho Strength Lab .\n\u201c So hula hooping is a way you can increase your caloric expenditure.\n\u201d Matheny noted that you \u2019 ll likely burn a similar amount of calories hula hooping as you would from walking for exercise .\nSome research has suggested possible benefits for your waistline .\nIn a 2019 study in the journal Obesity Facts , 53 overweight people either walked about 10,000 steps a day or used a three-pound weighted hula hoop for roughly 13 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise for 6 weeks then switched to the other group .\nBoth groups had a small amount of weight loss ( about one pound ) .\nThose who hula hooped lost more abdominal fat than those who walked , losing about three centimeters around their waist ( just over an inch ) compared with less than one centimeter in the walking group .\n( Keep in mind that the people in the hula hoop group also happened to walk a lot too , nearly 9,000 steps a day . )\nMatheny compared weighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise equipment , the mini elliptical machines that you keep under your desk to pedal while you work .\nThose are used while sitting , so Matheny said weighted hula hoops might be a better workout because you 're standing and doing something that you probably enjoy .\nHolly Perkins , a certified strength and conditioning expert and author of Lift to Get Lean , agreed that weighted hula hoops can be fun , which is an excellent motivator when doing any type of exercise .\n\u201c If this is something you enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your form of activity , go for it , \u201d Perkins said .\n\u201c Anything that moves you in the direction of being more active and having fun in life is what I want.\n\u201d She noted that moving your hips to make that hula hoop swing around likely engages muscles from your chest to your knees , so it is possible that you would see a change in body fat in that area .\nHowever , she said that the actual utility of hula hooping really depends on your motivation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforce your core for better functionality in day-to-day life , it may not be the best direction to go .\n( She recommends weight training for that purpose . )\nAside from that , they can also be a good choice for many reasons .\nWeighted or smart hula hoops don \u2019 t take up much space , need a ton of room to use , or make a lot of noise , so it probably won \u2019 t bother your downstairs neighbors .\nThey \u2019 re easy to use indoors in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allows you to multitask , and a way to mix up your exercise routine .\nBlack said she would recommend weighted hula hoops to people who are intimidated by the gym ( or maybe want to avoid gyms due to the COVID risk or membership cost ) or generally find working out to be a chore .\nMatheny advises starting with a lower weight hula hoop and building up gradually to protect your body .\nPerkins even suggests starting with an old-school , traditional , non-weighted hula hoop for that same reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , you can go heavier .\nBlack ended up upgrading to a new hula hoop that allowed her to add weight when her original hoop started to feel too easy .\n\u201c This is such an unusual movement pattern , so to jump straight to a weighted version , you run a much higher risk of injury , \u201d Perkins said .\n\u201c But if you start really accommodating your body to the movement pattern without a weight load and then you transition to something weighted , you 're going to substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are thinking about trying one , these are the best beginner , smart , and weighted hula hoops to get started .",

        "content": "What do they eat , where do they go to the bathroom , how did they get functioning saunas , and other questions answered .\nOTTAWA \u2014 When Ottawa police let hundreds of protest vehicles drive into the downtown core of the nation 's capital they did so under the seemingly reasonable assumption that there was no way the demonstrators could stick around in the streets of a city where temperatures regularly dip below 0 degrees Fahrenheit .\nThe police were wrong .\nBacked by donations of cash and supplies , the anti-vaccine mandate protesters have created an off-book supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people clothed and fed indefinitely .\nThey do this with the help of a separate site \u2014 a parking lot full of vehicles and tents \u2014 that serves as a sort of supply depot and logistics center .\nStaged next to a baseball park on Coventry Road , a few miles east of downtown , it is essentially sanctioned by the city .\nPolice have abandoned hopes of removing protesters for now and are adopting a strategy of containing and keeping watch .\nThat is not to say that police have left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of armed officers executed a nighttime raid on the site , seizing a cache of fuel .\nWhile the vibe downtown feels akin to a Canada Day festival , the Coventry Road site has more of a quasi-military feel .\nJournalists are , generally , not welcome .\nThere have been no reports of violence , but intense-looking guys staring down reporters sends the message .\n\u201c I got the distinct impression that it would be way , way better for me to be somewhere else .\nI left , \u201d Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first things photographer David Kawai and I saw on Saturday afternoon when we arrived at the site was a white van with \u201c FREDOM \u201d taped on the side .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a typo .\nThe owner of the van said he just ran out of tape .\nWhen I approached the registration tent \u2014 there is a registration tent \u2014 a man who lived nearby said his 16-year-old son wanted to come and volunteer .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a strong boy , he can lift stuff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The only thing is , he can \u2019 t drive.\n\u201d I identified myself as a reporter with BuzzFeed News .\nThis kicked off a tense and confused few minutes where several people surrounded me , saying they needed to determine if I was good media or bad media .\nOne woman demanded I prove I was who I said I was .\nIt wasn \u2019 t clear who was actually making the final call , but eventually one man stood up for us .\nWe were allowed to enter .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administrative area , complete with tables , chairs , supplies , and whiteboards listing names and numbers of key contacts .\nAnother whiteboard listed French and English directions ranging from handling fuel to dealing with police ( \u201c Stay calm/Restez calme , \u201d \u201c Right to remain silent/Vous avez le droit de garder le silence.\n\u201d ) Signs with slogans like \u201c Natural immunity is God \u2019 s science \u201d sat in the corner .\nAfter a bit more haggling over access , we were allowed to enter the main tent .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTables overflowed with supplies .\nFresh produce , canned goods , soap , winter clothing , you name it , it was on offer .\nDozens of people were buzzing about .\nSome were working , some were sitting and enjoying a meal .\n\u201c This is just a place for people to come and warm up , eat , \u201d said Carlo , an organizer from Montreal who did n't want to give his last name .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very heartwarming .\nIt \u2019 s shocking , actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get.\n\u201d Carlo said all of the supplies were donated .\nVolunteers transport them downtown as needed , or protesters can come out to Coventry Road for a meal .\nTaped to the exit of the main tent is a photo of a young girl holding a sign saying \u201c The truckers are coming to save us.\n\u201d One of our guides paused to point it out , saying , \u201c This Is What We Do It All For.\n\u201d The operation feels both surprisingly organized and ad hoc .\nAt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to ask what we were doing and who authorized us to be there .\nMy answer didn \u2019 t seem particularly convincing .\nI said I had been told to call a man named David , who after some discussion gave me permission over the phone to walk around .\nBut no one seemed to know what the proper protocol for handling media was , if one even existed , and no one kicked us out .\nThe longer we hung around , the more the organizers warmed up to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of the camp : two fully functional saunas .\nHe said a guy came and dropped them off out of the blue , telling organizers to use them as long as they want and to give him a call when they \u2019 re done with them .\nSame story for the mobile bathroom unit .\n\u201c Companies are just pouring in and installing stuff for us , whether it \u2019 s mobile bathrooms , kitchen equipment , tents .\nEverything you see here was donated , \u201d he said .\nThere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it \u2019 s clear the police don \u2019 t want the camp there and they \u2019 ve come a couple times \u2014 most notably during the fuel raid \u2014 but for the most part have left the camp alone.The people there are , understandably , proud of how much support they \u2019 ve received .\nThrough these donations , they \u2019 ve created a supply chain that has kept the downtown protests going strong for over two weeks now .\n\u201c We \u2019 re here for as long as it takes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here already equipped \u2014 and with the support we \u2019 ve been getting , I think we \u2019 re more than equipped right now to be here for the long term.\n\u201d The Coventry Road supply center is not , however , the movement \u2019 s headquarters , and protesters spend most of their time downtown .\nTop organizers are also elsewhere so that , according to one volunteer , police can \u2019 t move in and round them up .\nOne question multiple people have asked is : Where do they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of porta-potties set up throughout the downtown core , but not nearly enough .\nI asked Greg , a protester who has been living out of a van on Kent Street for over two weeks , where he relieves himself .\nHe said a lot of the local restaurants , caf\u00e9s , and hotels have let protesters come in and use their bathrooms .\nThis is a bit of a sore spot for residents .\nLast month , one Ottawa resident compiled a crowdsourced , unverified list of businesses \u201c supporting \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Twitter .\nPeople and businesses strenuously denied the list was accurate .\nConvoy supporters picked up on the witch hunt vibe of the list and spread it as evidence of the intolerance from the left .\nMy impression from talking to bar and restaurant workers is that they are having a very trying few weeks .\nSome definitely are letting protesters use their bathrooms , but not as some sign of tacit support for the cause .\nI \u2019 ve heard that businesses don \u2019 t want to anger the protesters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s also just a humanitarian element ; most Canadians aren \u2019 t going to feel good about saying no to someone who badly needs to go to the bathroom .\nAs for showers , Greg said many residents in the Ottawa area have extended offers for protesters to come to their homes and wash up .",

        "content": "While pandemic-related stress , anxiety , and grief due to the more than 900,000 COVID deaths in the US have had a well-documented impact on mental health , changes in daily life , like staying home for extended periods of time , can also affect other parts of your body , including your eyes , skin , and ability to focus .\nBuzzFeed News spoke to several doctors and experts about how spending more time at home can transform bodies in the short and long term .\nSpending more time indoors is known to increase the risk of nearsightedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in JAMA Ophthalmology suggested that during the pandemic , there were 1.4 to 3 times more cases of myopia in 2020 among children ages 6 to 8 than in the previous five years .\nThat wasn \u2019 t the case for kids ages 9 to 13 , who didn \u2019 t experience increases in myopia diagnoses .\nThe link is less studied in adults , but Dr. Mika Moy , an eye doctor and health sciences clinical professor at the University of California , Berkeley School of Optometry , said she isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients .\nHowever , close work ( spending hours reading or looking at something less than 20 centimeters , or about 7 to 8 inches distance from your face ) coupled with low light levels are thought to play a role in increased myopia risk .\n\u201c There 's other sort of generalizations , like people who live in cities tend to be more nearsighted than people who live in the country , and we think that 's because we 're finding there 's a protective connection with the outdoors , \u201d Moy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only eye-related problem that \u2019 s occurring during the pandemic .\nFor eyes , lockdowns in March 2020 were like having to \u201c run marathons without any training , \u201d Moy told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Your meetings are on the screen , your work is on the screen , and now everyone 's leisure time seems to also be on these screens.\n\u201d Often people forget to blink when staring at a screen for a long time , which deprives their eyes of moisturizing tears .\nWe \u2019 re also stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that secrete oil into our tears every time we blink .\nBlinking less can cause the glands to \u201c shrink away , \u201d Moy said , which isn \u2019 t good in the long run .\nEye drops called artificial tears can help relieve dryness , but they may not work as well as warm compresses .\nMoy suggests placing a warm washcloth over your eyes for 10 minutes about two times a day to feel relief .\nYou can also develop eye fatigue , which occurs when the muscles that control your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ; some people may get headaches or experience blurry vision as a result , Moy said .\nBlue light exposure is another factor to consider , which electronic devices emit .\nIt has one of the shorter yet higher energy wavelengths on the visible light spectrum , but experts agree there isn \u2019 t strong scientific evidence that shows it actually causes eye fatigue or damage .\n( Too much of it at night can make it harder for you to fall asleep , though , Moy said . )\nSo yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from staring at your computer all day , but the infamous blue light probably isn \u2019 t the culprit here .\nIn fact , the sun produces at least 100 times more blue light than a typical smartphone , the American Optometric Association says .\nThis means your fancy blue light glasses may not be doing much ; the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn \u2019 t recommend them .\nAnecdotally , however , Moy said her patients think they \u2019 re helpful ( personally , I think so , too , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne pair of glasses that might help are computer glasses , or \u201c occupational lenses , \u201d which are prescription frames that correct your vision specifically for computer-length distance , preventing your eyes from working too hard .\nThere are also some nonprescription reading glasses that are specifically made for computer work .\nOne of the best things you can do is give your eyes a break and try the 20-20-20 rule : every 20 minutes look 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds .\nOtherwise , take some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more ways than one .\nAlthough being indoors can protect you from sunburns and major risks of skin cancer from exposure to ultraviolet light , your vitamin D levels can drop because you \u2019 re not absorbing sunlight that helps your body produce it , notes Dr. Elizabeth Bahar Houshmand , a double board-certified dermatologist in Texas .\nVitamin D supports immune health , muscle function , brain activity , and the absorption of important minerals such as calcium , magnesium , and phosphate .\nStudies show vitamin D deficiency is associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone and muscle issues ( more on that later ) , and other health problems .\nA lack of sunlight exposure , darker skin , and older age increase your chances of having a deficiency .\nThe good news is that at least one 2021 study published in the European Journal of Public Health found that vitamin D deficiency was no more common in patients in Italy during 2020 lockdowns compared with previous years , suggesting it may not always be an issue for those of us spending extra time at home during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of sun exposure is necessary for your body to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D. Stepping outside for \u201c a few minutes a day is enough , \u201d Dr. Joshua Zeichner , director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , told BuzzFeed News .\nYou can also get your vitamin D from fortified foods , supplements , and certain foods like salmon and egg yolks .\nWhat both dermatologists have noticed during the pandemic is more patients coming in with rashes , acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes facial redness and pimplelike bumps on the skin .\nZeichner blames face masks , stress , and poor eating habits ( namely , eating too much sugar ) .\nSugar can promote inflammation in the body and drive oil production that can lead to acne breakouts , he said .\nOver time , excess sugar can trigger glycation \u2014 when sugar molecules attach to proteins in your skin called collagen \u2014 which can contribute to wrinkles , he said .\nRegular exercise can help .\nIt keeps your skin cells functioning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeichner said .\n\u201c The days may seem long and repetitive , but keep up with your skincare routine , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What you do now certainly will have an impact on your skin in the future.\n\u201d Then there \u2019 s a less obvious but still insidious impact on your body ( and mind ) .\nPeople are spending more time in Zoom meetings where staring at themselves in the harsh glare of a computer is making them more self-conscious about the way they look .\nBoth dermatologists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get rid of dark spots , wrinkles , and undereye bags .\nZeichner recommends wearing sunscreen , even indoors because harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can still pierce through windows and penetrate your skin .\nVarious stress-inducing pollutants also exist inside your home , Houshmand said , especially in the winter when central heating and lack of fresh air can dry your skin ; she recommends setting up a humidifier in your home to help .\nIf you \u2019 re anything like Michel , the 23-year-old with back trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains associated with turning your home into a workspace .\nDr. Charla Fischer , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News she \u2019 s seeing more patients come in with back pain related to poor posture while working from home .\n\u201c We sit in a bad position all day , hunched over a laptop , and the muscles get overstretched and microtears develop .\nThen the muscle starts to cramp because of this injury , and we get pain , \u201d Fischer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just an achy back .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c as dangerous for your health as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day , \u201d Dr. Nicholas DiNubile , an orthopedic surgeon at Premier Orthopedics And Sports Medicine in Pennsylvania and American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons spokesperson , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c We already have a big problem in our nation with this , and the pandemic only made it worse.\n\u201d Add inactivity with a lack of vitamin D and you have a \u201c real issue , \u201d DiNubile said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone health , but also muscle injuries , and tears are more common when levels are low.\n\u201d Kids , for example , are getting more injuries now that they \u2019 re returning to physical activities after about two years of home confinement .\n\u201c Never in my entire career have I gone two weeks without seeing an ACL injury , \u201d DiNubile said , yet at the beginning of the pandemic , about five months passed with no injured kid in sight .\n\u201c Now it \u2019 s payback .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being sedentary could lead to loss of muscle , too , which could slow metabolism and contribute to weight gain and obesity , he added .\nAnd over two-plus years , osteoporosis , or bone thinning , could become an issue , which is particularly worrisome for white and Asian women , postmenopausal women , and teenagers ( given bone health is built in teen years ) , DiNubile said .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important to make sure your home is equipped to support your body as best as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ergonomically appropriate equipment , like a monitor , adjustable office chair , keyboard , computer mouse , and proper back support .\nYou should set your monitor at eye level , keyboard at lap level , and both knees at a 90-degree angle , Fischer suggests , and incorporate standing breaks , short walks , and stretching into your daily routine to prevent future pain .\nSeating arrangements without cushions and solid back support will allow your body to slouch and form a \u201c C \u201d curve , said Fischer , who \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dining chair instead ( you can buy lumbar support pillows that fit any chair ) , and only use your bed for sleeping , she said .\n\u201c Mattresses are not designed for us to sit and do work on them.\n\u201d Our brains are incredibly adaptive , constantly adjusting to their surroundings .\nBut for some , shifting workplaces and social situations can have some surprising and unexpected impacts on daily life .\nJohn Redding , 46 , of Texas , said his inability to focus even for short periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor nuisance to a major issue , \u201d even with the help of medication .\n\u201c I used to be a voracious reader , but I have n't read an entire book since the pandemic started.\n\u201d Sam Ling , an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University , told BuzzFeed News some people may be less productive at home because there are more distractions there .\nHowever , that \u2019 s not the case for everyone .\nSereena Millward , 28 , told us she struggles to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office again .\n\u201c The sounds of people talking and eating at their desk grate on me , but I also can \u2019 t concentrate if it \u2019 s deadly silent.\n\u201d ( This feeling is called misophonia . )\nThat \u2019 s because a shift in how people interact from in person to online \u2014 and then back again \u2014 can be a bit of adjustment .\n\u201c There \u2019 s exhaustion that \u2019 s involved in monitoring social cues when there \u2019 s so little information available , \u201d Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimuli overload when we return to face-to-face interactions that may be overwhelming for some .\nLing noted that retraining our brains to socialize as we used to could take some time .\nThe brain is a muscle ; the parts we don \u2019 t exercise regularly will get a little wonky .\n\u201c COVID has promoted this hermitlike life , \u201d he said , although he doesn \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve permanently rewired our \u201c pretty plastic \u201d brains to solely tolerate the comfort of our homes .\n\u201c On so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest experiments that has ever been done on the human brain.\n\u201d Pandemic home life has been a blessing in disguise for some people .\nIt helped Abby Adesanya , 29 , experience a specific ( and pleasurable ) bodily sensation for the first time in April 2020 as she was listening to Dua Lipa \u2019 s Future Nostalgia album alone in her New York apartment .\n\u201c I was blasting the album , throwing my hands in the air , wishing I could be dancing in the clubs to this .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders start to vibrate , and it spread down my arms.\n\u201d Adesanya was experiencing frisson : the chills and goosebumps often felt after listening to music or watching something in synchrony .\nAnywhere between 55 % to 86 % of people experience frisson , yet Adesanya had never felt it .\n\u201c I can not believe my body suddenly just unlocked this ability .\nI do n't know if it was trying to fill in the blanks for missing stimuli .\nBut the fact it 's here is so cool , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really dark time.\n\u201d Ling said he isn \u2019 t surprised by Adesanya \u2019 s breakthrough .\nIt \u2019 s possible when going from a hyperstimulated environment such as life in New York City to a quiet apartment that the reduction in stimuli helped unbusy her mind .\nIt \u2019 s what meditation does for many people , he said .\nAnother body part that might have suffered during the pandemic is your teeth .\nThe cost and need for insurance normally prevents many people from going to the dentist , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dental work , added another barrier to routine checkups .\nKelly Holst , an assistant professor at Temple University \u2019 s Kornberg School of Dentistry in Pennsylvania , told BuzzFeed News this worsened dental problems for many people .\n\u201c There 's only so much you can do at home .\nYou can \u2019 t scrape off the plaque , food debris , and bacteria that harden and calcify on your teeth \u201d without a dentists \u2019 help , said Holst , who also noticed an uptick in patients with preexisting dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse boat.\n\u201d Pandemic-related stress and missed appointments have left some people with jaw pain associated with teeth grinding , too , she added .\nExtra time at home also means more , often unnecessary , snacking , which is \u201c notoriously bad for your oral health \u201d and clears the way for cavities to form , Holst said .\n\u201c At work , you 're sort of more regimented with your food intake .\nAt home , you kind of have that freedom to graze.\n\u201d Certain acidic foods and drinks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sports drinks , soda , and alcohol ) can contribute to demineralization in your enamel \u2014 the outer layer of your teeth and strongest tissue in your body \u2014 and make your mouth more acidic by throwing off your oral pH level , Holst said .\nDon \u2019 t want to put down the snacks ?\nHolst suggests you eat or drink them right away and avoid nibbling or sipping throughout the day .\nThat way you give your mouth time to naturally recalibrate itself .\nOtherwise , use fluoride toothpaste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine cleanings , and use an electric toothbrush , she said .\nSeveral people we spoke to said their body size experienced the most change during the pandemic .\nSome people lost weight , others gained .\nPatr\u00edcia Romano , 26 , used to struggle to gain weight ( she blames genetics and stress ) , but when her job became remote in 2020 , she stopped walking to and from work and gained 11 pounds .\nInstead of skipping lunch and dinner on the regular , she started eating more homemade meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to .\nBut the weight gain was rough for Romano , who \u2019 s a lawyer in Brazil .\nShe became obsessed with analyzing her body in the mirror and noticing flaws that many others likely couldn \u2019 t notice .\nIt got so bad that Romano took regular pregnancy tests because she would \u201c see a huge stomach , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c Now that some time has passed , it does n't bother me as much anymore , \u201d Romano said .\n\u201c I gave up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing it as this new body that has endured the delicate time of a worldwide stressful situation.\n\u201d Heidi ( who didn \u2019 t feel comfortable sharing her last name ) told us she got so tired of cooking for herself at home that she \u201c ended up eating less and losing a bunch of weight , which triggered some weird fatigue issues that were made worse with pandemic burnout and work-from-home/isolation.\n\u201d In general , you shouldn \u2019 t feel bad about weight changes during the pandemic .\nWe \u2019 ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nOne part of your body may have been particularly sensitive to all the changes related to your diet , mental health , and activity levels during the pandemic \u2014 your gastrointestinal tract .\nDr. Sarah McGill , an associate professor of medicine specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , told BuzzFeed News many patients say added stress and loneliness during the pandemic has led to an increase in abdominal pain , diarrhea , and nausea .\n\u201c The GI tract has even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we feel can cause GI distress , \u201d McGill said .\nWhat \u2019 s more , people increased their drinking during the pandemic , which isn \u2019 t a positive trend given alcohol is directly toxic to your GI tract , can cause fat to accumulate in your liver , and contribute to liver damage , McGill said .\nA Johns Hopkins survey of 832 adults over 21 found 60 % reported increased drinking in May 2020 compared to pre-COVID times and 34 % reported binge drinking .\nStress , alcohol availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers for increased drinking .\nFor Beth Boardman , 61 , a writer and retired nurse in California , regular afternoon wine on an empty stomach led her to develop acute gastritis and esophagitis , or inflammation of the lining of the stomach and esophagus .\nMcGill said you should avoid alcohol as much as you can , and exercise regularly , which will keep your bowel movements flowing as they should , help you maintain a stable weight , and keep your heart healthy .\nSpeaking of bowel movements , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending more time at home .\nWhile some people may have experienced more constipation from a suddenly sedentary lifestyle , others may have seen an improvement from an increased ability to listen to body cues \u2014 and easier access to a bathroom .\nHolding back bowel movements \u2014 for example , because you \u2019 re commuting or working in a busy office \u2014 can make constipation more likely , McGill said .\nSo , it \u2019 s safe to say spending more time at home may have made going to the bathroom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced diet consisting of fruits , vegetables , and fiber-rich whole grains is important to keep things running smoothly , whether you are spending time at home or more time out of the house .\n\u201c Fiber directly contributes to gut health by feeding the trillions of microorganisms we have there , which in turn help us with our mood , metabolism , and lots of other aspects of health , \u201d McGill said .",

        "content": "Last month I had strep throat\u2013level pain while living with two people who were confirmed COVID positive .\nYet , several rapid tests kept telling me I was COVID-free .\nIt \u2019 s a confusing experience shared by many as the highly transmissible Omicron variant continues to spread in the US .\nAt the same time , millions more at-home rapid tests are becoming available .\n( And by available , I mean there are more of them , but you can \u2019 t always find them at your local store .\nYou can order free rapid tests from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still the gold standard , they can take a few days to a week or more to produce results as understaffed labs struggle to keep up with demand .\nRapid tests are a welcome addition because they can give results in minutes .\nBut beware of the dreaded false negative .\nIt happened to Georgia resident and economist Christopher Cunningham , 46 , whose 16-year-old daughter had a positive result on a PCR test on Jan. 7 and again 10 days later .\nHer rapid tests , however , always came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 9-year-old daughter .\n( Both were vaccinated . )\nBut just because your rapid test takes a while to turn positive \u2060\u2014 or doesn \u2019 t at all \u2060\u2014 it doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re free of infection or that your test is a fraud .\nIt could happen because you were vaccinated , you missed the window when it would \u2019 ve turned positive , you collected your test sample incorrectly , or you need to test again in a few days , according to Dr. Emily Landon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine .\n( Keep in mind your symptoms could have a non-COVID cause , too \u2014 the flu is circulating . )\nHere \u2019 s how rapid tests work and why you can get false negative results when you have COVID , particularly in the early stages of infection .\nRapid COVID tests , also called antigen tests , work by detecting bits of proteins on the surface of the coronavirus .\nThey only appear positive when your body has a certain amount of virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not detect COVID cases that don \u2019 t reach that threshold .\nAnd most importantly , Landon noted , rapid tests can be negative early in your infection even if you \u2019 re feeling symptoms because it may take a while before there \u2019 s enough virus for the test to pick up .\n( Your vaccination status can influence this process , too , but more on that later . )\nThis relatively high threshold correlates with contagiousness , experts say .\nIf your rapid test is positive , you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , Landon said .\nIf it \u2019 s negative later on in the course of your infection , after symptoms resolve , you \u2019 re likely no longer infectious .\n\u201c Rapid tests are definitely not like a pregnancy test where it 's going to be positive as long as it 's been a few weeks after someone missed a period , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It 's only going to pick it up when you 're at peak infectiousness , and they \u2019 re almost never false positive.\n\u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm a positive rapid test result with a PCR test , Landon added .\n( The FDA and CDC agree . )\n\u201c Rapid tests are really reliable , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c You do n't need to swear at the company and say , \u2018 There 's no way I could have COVID \u2019 ; you definitely have COVID .\nYou need to stay home.\n\u201d There \u2019 s a relatively small window when a rapid test will be positive You can think of your viral load like a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of medicine and pathology and laboratory medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School .\n\u201c It kind of goes up sharply to a peak and then it starts to decline eventually down to zero.\n\u201d However , the window of peak viral load when rapid tests will appear positive can be relatively short , Landon said , and some people are going to miss it entirely , which could explain my and many others \u2019 experience .\nThe window varies widely , too ; it could last three days , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for some people because everyone clears the virus from their system at their own pace , she said .\nIn what seems like another layer of complexity , the intensity of that second line on your rapid test is likely an indicator of infectiousness , experts say .\nThe darker it is ( and the quicker it appears within the 15-minute wait period ) , the higher your viral load and risk of spreading the virus , and vice versa .\nYou should take more than one rapid test If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid test , Landon suggests you confirm that result with a PCR test or take another rapid within the next two days .\nWhile rapid tests are specific and are unlikely to generate a false positive , they aren \u2019 t that sensitive , meaning they are more likely to generate a false negative than some other tests .\nOn the other hand , PCR tests are much more sensitive .\nThey look for the tiniest fragments of coronavirus genetic material by multiplying the virus over a million times until it becomes detectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means PCR tests could be positive even though you \u2019 re no longer contagious because they can pick up on really low viral loads .\nThese tiny viral remains could also be zombies : pieces of dead virus that can \u2019 t make you or others sick .\nThe takeaway : Don \u2019 t be surprised if your PCR test stays positive for weeks or months after initial infection .\nIt \u2019 s normal and common .\nThe CDC says you can end isolation after five days if you have not had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are resolving .\nAfter that , they suggest caution for an additional five days , including mask-wearing , avoiding travel , and staying away from people who are at high risk .\nYou do n't need to have a negative result to end isolation , but if you do want to take a rapid antigen test , they suggest testing near the end of the five-day period when you have been fever-free for 24 hours ( without taking fever-reducing medicine ) .\nIf it 's still positive , you should isolate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important things you should remember about rapid COVID tests is that they aren \u2019 t influenced by symptoms \u2014 they only turn positive if your nasal swab has enough virus it can detect .\nWhile logically you might think more virus equals more symptoms , that \u2019 s not always the case .\nYour runny nose and muscle aches are just your body \u2019 s reactions to it fighting the coronavirus off , and that reaction varies depending on if you \u2019 ve encountered the germ before , either from an infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after symptoms appear for your body to produce a viral load that \u2019 s to the rapid test \u2019 s liking .\nHaving symptoms can be a bonus , however , because they can help you decide when to take your rapid test to ensure you get the most accurate results possible .\n\u201c People who are asymptomatic pretty much have the same rise and fall in viral load as people who are symptomatic , \u201d Blaser said .\n\u201c So , you do n't really know where you are in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic , you can still spread the coronavirus even if you \u2019 re symptom-free .\nThis means rapid tests are also helpful tools for asymptomatic people , though it \u2019 s harder to tell when to take a test without symptoms to guide you , Landon said .\nMoreover , time isn \u2019 t on your side , Landon admitted .\nRapid test results can change quickly as your viral load rises and drops , often within hours , so if you don \u2019 t have COVID symptoms , taking a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is much better than using it the day or morning before because in 12 hours that test could read positive.\n\u201d It \u2019 s unclear how viral load differs between symptomatic and asymptomatic people infected with the Omicron variant , but many early studies found it was comparable among the groups .",

        "content": "During the past two years of the pandemic , there have been some profound racial and ethnic disparities , with some communities of color having COVID hospitalization and mortality rates more than double that of other groups of people .\nNow , a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report suggests there are inequities in the use of lifesaving COVID treatments , with some people less likely than others to get early treatment with monoclonal antibodies , which has been shown to prevent hospitalizations and deaths .\nThe analysis found that people who are Hispanic faced the most barriers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies 58 % less often than their non-Hispanic peers .\nPatients who were Asian , as well as those who identified with the \u201c other \u201d category , including Native American , Alaska Native , Native Hawaiian , and multiracial patients , received monoclonal antibodies about 48 % and 47 % less often , respectively , than white patients .\nBlack patients were treated with the protective proteins 22 % less often .\nThe research team , led by Jennifer Wiltz and Amy Feehan , looked at electronic records for COVID treatments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 US healthcare systems between November 2020 and August 2021 .\nAbout 11 % were treated in a hospital , where the differences in use among racial and ethnic groups were less pronounced .\nThe treatments included monoclonal antibodies , the antiviral medication remdesivir , and the steroid dexamethasone , which is used to fight inflammation .\nSome are used early on in an infection and can help prevent COVID hospitalization , like monoclonal antibodies .\nOthers , like steroids , are used later in serious cases to battle out-of-control immune reactions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 4 % or less for all racial and ethnic groups , according to the report released Jan. 14 .\nMonoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins infused or injected into patients , typically in health clinics or doctor \u2019 s offices within 10 days of symptoms .\nOverall , average monthly use of monoclonal antibodies was low : 4 % in white patients , 2.8 % in Black patients , 2.2 % in patients who were Asian or another race , and 1.8 % in Hispanic patients .\nOnce hospitalized , there seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dexamethasone , and patients who were Black received remdesivir about 9 % more often than others .\nThe researchers said the disparities they uncovered with monoclonal antibodies may not reflect those in the real world because they were restricted to patients who received COVID treatments through a healthcare system ; monoclonal antibodies can be given to patients in government-run infusion sites that likely go unrecorded .\nThe researchers also didn \u2019 t analyze the reason for the disparities , but they speculate that a number of systemic factors are likely to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , insufficient health insurance , potential bias among medical professionals or a lack of a primary care doctor to recommend the treatments , and language barriers , which can leave people unaware of therapies and vulnerable to severe yet preventable COVID outcomes .\nThese factors also make it more likely people of color will develop medical conditions that raise their chances of severe COVID , the CDC says , contributing to disproportionate coronavirus infection , hospitalization , and death rates among racial and ethnic groups .\n\u201c I just want to emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , \u201d Dr. Utibe Essien , an assistant professor of medicine and health disparities researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c This is not a new issue .\nThere are so many tiers and levers that we can all be pulling to address this , going all the way from when these drugs are developed to who is present in the studies that test these drugs to how easy is it for patients to access medications at a doctor or pharmacy.\n\u201d There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse \u201d these disparities , Dr. Amesh Adalja , an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security , told BuzzFeed News .\nMobile clinics that bring monoclonal antibody treatments to patients and telemedicine visits that make it easier to see a doctor can help spread awareness and access to treatments for high-risk patients .\nOne recent study found telemedicine visits helped increase attendance at follow-up doctor \u2019 s appointments after hospitalization from 52 % to 70 % among Black patients .\nThe study included patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason from January 2019 to June 2020 .\nIn contrast , follow-up care among white patients dropped slightly , from 68 % to 67 % in the same period .\nCOVID treatment guidelines don \u2019 t always take into account race and ethnicity Although the CDC study looked at patients treated before the Omicron and Delta surges , some states like North Carolina , Texas , and Mississippi are still struggling with COVID treatment shortages , leading doctors to prioritize therapies for the highest-risk patients .\nNational health officials often recommend COVID treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own recommendations , meaning guidance and access to COVID therapies may differ depending on where you live .\nThe FDA , for example , includes race and ethnicity as a potential risk factor for severe COVID in its medication fact sheets for healthcare providers .\nAn FDA spokesperson told BuzzFeed News it \u2019 s up to doctors to \u201c consider the benefit-risk for an individual patient \u201d when determining access to therapies .\nSome states like New York and Utah have adopted that language , stating doctors should consider race and ethnicity when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID .",

        "content": "As we head into year three of the COVID-19 pandemic , the updates and recommendations for how to stay safe from COVID , particularly for children , seem to be evolving as fast as a new variant in an unvaccinated population .\n( Sorry , pandemic humor . )\nIn all seriousness , as Omicron surges , the new guidance for children \u2019 s vaccines , boosters , masking , and school safety are moving so quickly that it \u2019 s hard for parents and caregivers to keep up .\nThe result is often pandemic-related confusion : Are cloth masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to return to school based on symptoms and testing ?\nIs COVID really as bad as or worse than familiar childhood ailments like the flu and RSV ?\nAnd , most importantly , do parents really need to test a child for COVID every time they get a sniffle ?\nIf you \u2019 re sick of asking people in the group chat or on the playground ( and getting very strong and likely incorrect opinions ) , we asked some real experts for the answers to common questions .\nHere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the COVID symptoms in children ?\nChildren generally have symptoms just like adults , including a cough , fever , a runny nose , and sore throat .\nThe latest development is that kids with COVID can often have croup , which causes a distinctive cough , hoarseness , and labored breathing .\n\u201c For many of the young kids I have been seeing , they present with croup , \u201d said Dr. Jennifer Shu , an Atlanta-based pediatrician .\nSometimes the only symptoms in babies are fussiness and increased crying because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The baby may be crying and you can \u2019 t pinpoint a reason for it , \u201d she said .\nChildren also get a loss of taste and smell , just like adults , but they may have more trouble articulating that than an adult would , said Dr. Dean Blumberg , chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children \u2019 s Hospital .\nIn general , kids tend to have a less severe illness than adults .\nUnfortunately , hospitalizations are on the rise for children , including babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn fact , hospitalizations are at the highest point since the start of the pandemic , according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky .\nMy kid always has a runny nose , especially in winter .\nDo I need to get them tested every time they \u2019 re stuffed up ?\nTesting every kid for COVID every day is \u201c just not practical , \u201d said George Rutherford , a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of California , San Francisco .\nHe doesn \u2019 t think children need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an exposure or symptoms of \u201c more severe upper respiratory infections.\n\u201d Blumberg agreed and said when it comes to testing kids , it 's more important to focus on new symptoms ; a child might have a runny nose due to allergies or something else .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t think there is anything out of the ordinary with your child , then you don \u2019 t have to test because of symptoms such as a runny nose , \u201d he said .\nHowever , Shu recommends that given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s a good idea to err on the side of caution and test children .\n\u201c We are seeing so much COVID compared to other cold viruses , even higher than flu in my area , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The vast majority of viruses I \u2019 m seeing are COVID.\n\u201d She added , \u201c There \u2019 s a ton .\nCOVID can look like any other respiratory illness.\n\u201d How accurate are rapid tests for young children under the age of 5 ?\nRutherford said there doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they perform for children versus adults .\nRapid tests should work even when used in babies , experts told us .\nThat said , false negatives are common in rapid COVID tests early in an infection .\nYou may need to retest after a negative result , particularly if a child has respiratory symptoms .\n\u201c The timing can be tricky , \u201d Shu said .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t catch it on the right day where there \u2019 s enough virus to trigger that test to turn positive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false negative.\n\u201d A positive result on a rapid antigen test is much more reliable in general ( meaning if the result is positive , your child almost certainly has COVID if they also have symptoms ) , although following up with a PCR test to confirm is recommended .\nHow strong is the evidence that kids in preschool or at any age should be wearing masks ?\nThe evidence for masking in preschool \u201c is strong , \u201d Rutherford said , as long as the child is over 2 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for younger children .\nThe data doesn \u2019 t come directly from preschools , but Rutherford said there \u2019 s \u201c really good \u201d evidence for the effectiveness of masks in elementary schools , and there \u2019 s no reason to think preschools would be different .\nBlumberg said surgical masks provide 60 % \u201370 % protection , and he prefers those over cloth masks , which are less standardized .\n( Any mask is better than no mask . )\nWhen Shu is choosing a surgical mask , she looks for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is three- or four-ply , which tends to offer the best protection .\nYour child can use a medical mask and a cloth mask over it to be extra safe , or they can wear a KN95 or N95 mask if they can tolerate it .\nWhile N95s come in smaller sizes and can be worn by children , they can be harder to breathe though , and it \u2019 s important to find a mask that fits well and that a child will actually wear .\n\u201c If they aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t wear it at all , \u201d Blumberg said .\nParents of children who are immunocompromised may prefer the greater protection that comes with an N95 ; some people , he added , buy several kinds to find one their child is comfortable with .\nKids often adapt to mask-wearing ( and wearing them correctly ) better than adults , he said .\nLetting kids choose and decorate masks can increase the chances that they will wear them .\nChildren may also play with the masks , get them wet by biting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them more quickly than you \u2019 d think , Shu said , so it \u2019 s important to swap them out as necessary .\nSome schools or preschools let kids come in with a negative rapid test , even when they have minor cold symptoms .\nOthers require no symptoms for 24 hours and a negative PCR .\nWhich policy makes more sense ?\n\u201c You do n't want colds passed around schools either , right ?\n\u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c But on the other hand , one of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go work .\nThat 's a benefit of it .\nAnd if you send them home every time they sneeze , you 're going to have a lot of unhappy parents.\n\u201d Rutherford said it makes sense for schools to continue to follow whatever pre-COVID sickness policies they had in place , with an added layer of COVID testing for children with more severe upper respiratory symptoms .\nBut he said this testing should be rapid , not PCR , which usually takes multiple days to deliver results .\nBlumberg said it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer that children who are having symptoms , like coughing , stay home until they are better .\n\u201c Schools may be extra sensitive to respiratory symptoms , even in a setting of a negative test , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c It just makes everyone uncomfortable to be around somebody who is coughing or sneezing in the age of COVID.\n\u201d Shu recommends sticking to CDC guidelines if a child does test positive for COVID .\nThe CDC recommends that kids who test positive stay out of school for 10 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults .\nThe agency recently shortened the isolation period to five days for adults who are asymptomatic , followed by five more days of mask-wearing .\nIt \u2019 s a different story for kids , who are at school all day and have to take their masks off to eat lunch , exercise in gym class , and for other reasons .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not like they can continue to stay masked for the second five days of that 10-day isolation , \u201d Shu said .\nHow long does COVID last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms in children can range from very mild or nonexistent to more severe , such as a high fever or chest pain , which may necessitate a hospital visit for oxygen , depending on other risk factors and whether they are vaccinated .\nThe symptoms can last as little as one day , Shu said , but usually it \u2019 s about a week or sometimes even longer .\n\u201c A lot of my patients are having a cough linger for three to four weeks , \u201d Shu said .\nHow worried should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long COVID ?\nMore research still needs to be done to determine how often children \u2014 especially the youngest ones \u2014 get long COVID , which can make people sick for months .\nLong COVID , which can include memory and sleep problems , fatigue , and shortness of breath , is more common in adults than children .\nAnd it \u2019 s more common in older children and teens than younger kids .\nAbout 20 % \u201340 % of teens who get infected may develop long COVID , said Blumberg .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , but we don \u2019 t have good numbers on that.\n\u201d However , the symptoms are similar in children and can include fatigue and difficulty sleeping .\n\u201c Older children will describe fuzzy thinking , that they are just not able to think clearly or they might have memory issues , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c Those are the kind of long COVID symptoms we have been seeing in children.\n\u201d Shu has an 11-year-old patient who got COVID early in the pandemic and lost his sense of smell and taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be able to be as active in sports as in the past because of chest pain , breathing problems , and shortness of breath , she said .\nWhere does COVID-19 fall on the scale of severity for childhood diseases ?\nIs it more or less serious than the flu or RSV ?\nAbout 100 to 150 children die each year in the US from the flu , and 100 to 500 from the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .\nIn comparison , more than 800 children have died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pandemic .\nAbout 7.9 million children in the US , or more than 1 in 10 , have tested positive for COVID .\nIn 2020 , COVID was the seventh-leading cause of death in children in the US .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s worse than RSV and worse than influenza , \u201d Blumberg said .\nPart of the reason the mortality rate is so high with COVID is that no one in the population had any immunity to this new virus .\nAs more children get vaccinated for COVID ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are exposed to the virus , hopefully , fewer children will get severely sick and die , he said .\n\u201c Getting vaccinated is the safest thing for children , \u201d he said .\nIs the COVID vaccine safe for kids ?\nYes , it \u2019 s considered very safe .\nNo children have died due to vaccination , unlike COVID , which , as we said , is potentially life-threatening .\nMore than 9 billion doses of vaccine have been given worldwide , so there \u2019 s a \u201c proven track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about 23 % of children 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated , and about 62 % of children 12 to 17 .\nThe vaccine is now approved for children 5 and older , and kids 12 and older can get vaccinated and a booster .\n\u201c I am disappointed that the numbers are so low , \u201d she said .\nMany children who are eligible are not getting vaccinated .\n\u201c Any loss of a child \u2019 s life is tragic , so why not try to avoid that ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the American Academy of Pediatrics .\n\u201c I often have people say in hindsight , 'Gosh , I wish I had gotten the vaccine . '\nI \u2019 ve never had someone say , \u2018 Gosh , I wish I hadn \u2019 t gotten the vaccine.\n\u2019 \u201d How can you best protect babies and children who are too young to get vaccinated or wear masks ?\nAs we said , masks aren \u2019 t appropriate for children under age 2 , and kids under 5 can \u2019 t get vaccinated .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers have been vaccinated or infected .\nVaccination is highly recommended for people who are pregnant because of the high risk of COVID complications in pregnancy as well as the ability to generate antibodies that can be passed to the fetus .\n\u201c I do n't think infants are susceptible until after 6 months of life because they get a lot of maternal antibody transplacentally and through breast milk , \u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c Now , after 7 months , 8 , 9 months , as maternal antibodies start to wane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , but they 're not common at all.\n\u201d The best way to protect youngsters is to make sure the people around them wear masks , are vaccinated , and have had their boosters .\n\u201c Surrounding the baby with a \u2018 bubble \u2019 of people who are vaccinated is a great first step , \u201d said Dr. Danielle Zerr , head of pediatric infectious diseases at Seattle Children \u2019 s Hospital , in an email .\n\u201c In addition , depending on community transmission rates , other steps would include avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close interaction to just the important people in your life who are vaccinated , and avoiding contact with symptomatic people .\n\u201d",

        "content": "If you \u2019 ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately , you may have found long lines , empty shelves , and a frustrating lack of availability in general .\nThis is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country , now about 95 % of cases in the US .\nPresident Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation .\nWhile increased test availability is a good thing , those government-supplied , at-home COVID tests may not be available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be distributed .\nAnd if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests , a lot of questions remain .\nHow reliable are they ?\nWhen should you use them ?\nDo they perform differently with Omicron ?\nHere are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests .\nWhen should you use rapid COVID tests ?\nRapid COVID tests are , well , rapidly becoming a way of life in the US .\nAfter being absent in the US for much of the pandemic , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out \u2014 in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online .\nThe pro is that they give fast results \u2014 in about 15 minutes , allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result .\nThe con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests , like a PCR , that can take a day or more to get results .\n\u201c Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina , a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed , a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing .\n\u201c The government is in a position now where it \u2019 s bringing these tests forward , and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used , \u201d he said Tuesday at a press briefing .\nYou can take a COVID test for any reason at all , but here are the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you have been vaccinated .\n\u2022 If you have COVID symptoms , including cough , shortness of breath , fever , and other respiratory virus symptoms \u2022 Have been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes .\n( If you are unvaccinated , get tested right away ; if you are fully vaccinated , get tested within five to seven days after exposure , according to the CDC . )\n\u2022 If you took part in high-risk activities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially distance as recommended , such as when traveling , in crowded indoor places , or attending large gatherings or mass events Many people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work , school , or before or after travel or events .\nAlthough vaccines , especially when combined with a booster , are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant , \u201c we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated , \u201d CDC chief Rochelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday .\n\u201c These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.\n\u201d Regardless of vaccination status , you should wear a mask in public indoor settings .\nWalensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors \u201c to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.\n\u201d How many different at-home COVID tests are there ?\nThere are now ( at least ) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests , which are the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , and generally cost about $ 20 to $ 35 for two \u2014 if you can find them .\nAn antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus , which can be picked up with a nasal swab .\nKeep in mind that no test is perfect .\nAny given medical test is measured by its sensitivity , or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives , and specificity , how good it is at ruling out people who aren \u2019 t sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA \u2019 s emergency-use authorization : There are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test , but they cost more , Mina said .\nThey include Detect , Cue Health , and Lucira , which can be done at home , as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor \u2019 s offices .\n\u201c Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also fewer of them available .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test , \u201d he said .\nIn general , yes .\nBut you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests , like PCR .\nAnd it \u2019 s important to note , a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet peer reviewed , included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York , Los Angeles , and San Francisco in December 2021 .\nThe people were fully vaccinated , many with boosters .\nThe research team , led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson , compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results .\nThey found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test .\nWhile it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests didn \u2019 t always detect a high viral load , the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests , Adamson told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile , \u201d she said .\n\u201c So I think it will move quickly.\n\u201d False positives are much less common .\nHowever , the chances of a false positive can vary by brand , ranging from one in 150 tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat said , if your rapid test gives a positive result , you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test , like PCR .\nRapid tests are about 30 % to 40 % less sensitive than PCR tests , and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms .\nIn one study , a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35 % in asymptomatic people and 64 % in people with symptoms when compared with PCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to people who tested positive for COVID , whether or not they had symptoms .\nIn the study , there were only a handful of false positives , all in asymptomatic people \u2014 but 47 % were false negatives compared with PCR .\nThese are still good tests !\nIt \u2019 s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more ( often many more ) to get a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy .\n\u201c The test is very good when it \u2019 s positive , but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result , \u201d said Dr. Stanley Weiss , a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey .\nIf you get a negative result , follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to believe that you were exposed or infected .\nWait at least 24 hours for your next test , according to the CDC , but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative .\nMina recommends that if you start having symptoms , assume you have Omicron and self-isolate .\nTake your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later .\nWhen interpreting and making decisions based on a test result , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account a person \u2019 s history of vaccination , mask use , exposures to others , and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive , Weiss said .\nYes , that seems to be the case , although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant .\nIt makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few PCR-based tests that don \u2019 t and have recommended that labs don \u2019 t use them .\nIf you do have COVID symptoms , can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic ?\nYes , according to Mina .\nThat \u2019 s because early in the pandemic , humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms \u2014 which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus \u2014 started later in the timeline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have either had COVID , been vaccinated , or in some cases both , symptoms generally start sooner .\n( And it \u2019 s clear that you can get COVID two or more times . )\n\u201c You 're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early , \u201d Mina said .\nHe also noted that \u2019 s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose .\n\u201c That \u2019 s your immunity working , \u201d he said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as an antigen test ?\nNot exactly .\nA lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears \u2014 a positive control to show the test is working \u2014 and another line appears if the test is positive .\nWhile all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests , not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests .\nFor example , pregnancy tests also work in this way but use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing .\nCan a rapid test protect you from getting sick ?\nNot really .\nRapid tests are more about protecting other people , not making sure you don \u2019 t get the virus .\n( That \u2019 s what vaccines , masks , and social distancing are all about . )\nHowever , when people get tested before going to work , a party , school , or traveling , it helps protect everyone .\n( Although it also helps you get treatment sooner , which is important because almost all effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the sooner they are started . )\nRapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus , Mina said .\n\u201c For somebody who \u2019 s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people , then the tests are more likely 95 % or 98 % sensitive for those individuals , \u201d he said .",

        "content": "What they eat , where they go to the bathroom , how they get functioning saunas , and other questions answered .\nOTTAWA \u2014 When Ottawa police let hundreds of protest vehicles drive into the downtown core of the nation 's capital , they did so under the seemingly reasonable assumption that there was no way the demonstrators could stick around in the streets of a city where temperatures regularly dip below 0 degrees Fahrenheit .\nThe police were wrong .\nBacked by donations of cash and supplies , the anti-vaccine mandate protesters have created an off-book supply chain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fed indefinitely .\nThey do this with the help of a separate site \u2014 a parking lot full of vehicles and tents \u2014 that serves as a sort of supply depot and logistics center .\nStaged next to a baseball park on Coventry Road , a few miles east of downtown , it is essentially sanctioned by the city .\nPolice have abandoned hopes of removing protesters for now and are adopting a strategy of containing and keeping watch .\nThat is not to say that police have left it entirely alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed officers executed a nighttime raid on the site , seizing a cache of fuel .\nWhile the vibe downtown feels akin to a Canada Day festival , the Coventry Road site has more of a quasi-military feel .\nJournalists are , generally , not welcome .\nThere have been no reports of violence , but intense-looking guys staring down reporters sends the message .\n\u201c I got the distinct impression that it would be way , way better for me to be somewhere else .\nI left , \u201d Matt Gurney wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first things photographer David Kawai and I saw on Saturday afternoon when we arrived at the site was a white van with \u201c FREDOM \u201d taped on the side .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a typo .\nThe owner of the van said he just ran out of tape .\nWhen I approached the registration tent \u2014 there is a registration tent \u2014 a man who lived nearby said his 16-year-old son wanted to come and volunteer .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a strong boy , he can lift stuff for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing is , he can \u2019 t drive.\n\u201d I identified myself as a reporter with BuzzFeed News .\nThis kicked off a tense and confused few minutes where several people surrounded me , saying they needed to determine if I was good media or bad media .\nOne woman demanded I prove I was who I said I was .\nIt wasn \u2019 t clear who was actually making the final call , but eventually one man stood up for us .\nWe were allowed to enter .\nThe first tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , complete with tables , chairs , supplies , and whiteboards listing names and numbers of key contacts .\nAnother whiteboard listed French and English directions ranging from handling fuel to dealing with police ( \u201c Stay calm/Restez calme , \u201d \u201c Right to remain silent/Vous avez le droit de garder le silence.\n\u201d ) Signs with slogans like \u201c Natural immunity is God \u2019 s science \u201d sat in the corner .\nAfter a bit more haggling over access , we were allowed to enter the main tent .\nIt felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflowed with supplies .\nFresh produce , canned goods , soap , winter clothing , you name it , it was on offer .\nDozens of people were buzzing about .\nSome were working , some were sitting and enjoying a meal .\n\u201c This is just a place for people to come and warm up , eat , \u201d said Carlo , an organizer from Montreal who did n't want to give his last name .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very heartwarming .\nIt \u2019 s shocking , actually , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Carlo said all of the supplies were donated .\nVolunteers transport them downtown as needed , or protesters can come out to Coventry Road for a meal .\nTaped to the exit of the main tent is a photo of a young girl holding a sign saying \u201c The truckers are coming to save us.\n\u201d One of our guides paused to point it out , saying , \u201c This Is What We Do It All For.\n\u201d The operation feels both surprisingly organized and ad hoc .\nAt a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to ask what we were doing and who authorized us to be there .\nMy answer didn \u2019 t seem particularly convincing .\nI said I had been told to call a man named David , who after some discussion gave me permission over the phone to walk around .\nBut no one seemed to know what the proper protocol for handling media was , if one even existed , and no one kicked us out .\nThe longer we hung around , the more the organizers warmed up to us .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the camp : two fully functional saunas .\nHe said a guy came and dropped them off out of the blue , telling organizers to use them as long as they want and to give him a call when they \u2019 re done with them .\nSame story for the mobile bathroom unit .\n\u201c Companies are just pouring in and installing stuff for us , whether it \u2019 s mobile bathrooms , kitchen equipment , tents .\nEverything you see here was donated , \u201d he said .\nThere was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s clear the police don \u2019 t want the camp there and they \u2019 ve come a couple of times \u2014 most notably during the fuel raid \u2014 but for the most part have left the camp alone .\nThe people there are , understandably , proud of how much support they \u2019 ve received .\nThrough these donations , they \u2019 ve created a supply chain that has kept the downtown protests going strong for over two weeks now .\n\u201c We \u2019 re here for as long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We came here already equipped \u2014 and with the support we \u2019 ve been getting , I think we \u2019 re more than equipped right now to be here for the long term.\n\u201d The Coventry Road supply center is not , however , the movement \u2019 s headquarters , and protesters spend most of their time downtown .\nTop organizers are also elsewhere so that , according to one volunteer , police can \u2019 t move in and round them up .\nOne question multiple people have asked is : Where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some lines of porta-potties set up throughout the downtown core , but not nearly enough .\nI asked Greg , a protester who has been

to get in on trends without any real evidence or proof that they work .\nIf Emily Mariko says to stick an ice cube in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I \u2019 m doing it .\nIf Millie Leer vouches that bar soap is the best product to laminate my brows , I \u2019 m slathering it in on .\nAnd if every single person I see is wearing butt-lifting leggings that seem to make their rear look higher , firmer , and rounder than ever before , I \u2019 m buying them .\nWhen it came to the TikTok leggings , however , there were a few problems : 1 ) I am frugal by nature and refuse to spend money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) I kept seeing options that looked slightly different yet nobody was calling out brand names , and I had to know which pair was best , and 3 ) I needed to know if they could actually be worn during exercise .\nFor the sake of journalism , I decided to break my first rule and buy both the Amazon Seasum Butt Lift Tights and the Halara Butt Lifting Leggings ( which my research showed to be the two most popular leggings on TikTok ) .\nBefore we dive in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m more of a sweatpants-to-lounge , leggings-to-work-out kind of gal .\nI rarely wear leggings without at least the intention of exercising at some point in the day , so it \u2019 s important to me that they are comfortable , flattering , and functional , which are the three categories I used to evaluate the leggings popular on TikTok .\nYes , a flattering look is still important because most gyms and workout studios have mirrors , and seeing a reflection that makes me feel good can give me the confidence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in black .\nBlack and other similarly dark colors tend to be my default when it comes to leggings since I am a human who sweats when I work out .\nI prefer to not have that show through my pants , especially because that sweat generally comes through right around the crotch .\n( Although some high-quality colored leggings won \u2019 t show sweat either . )\nAs a 5-foot-6 woman , I \u2019 m slightly above average in height .\nI \u2019 ve been told that I have an athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , my butt is neither flat nor is it anything groundbreaking . )\nOverall I would call myself medium-size , but after looking at the sizing charts , reading some reviews , and knowing how I like my leggings to fit , I ordered a small in both pairs .\nYou can buy the Seasum High Waist Butt Lift Tights from Amazon for around $ 19 .\nYou can buy the In My Feels High Waisted Textured Butt Lifting 7/8 Leggings from Halara for around $ 28 .\nDo TikTok leggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that even Lizzo had gone with the Seasum butt-lifting leggings , I was understandably excited to try them out .\nI watched countless videos of people not only feeling themselves , but also filming the frankly shook reactions of their significant others upon seeing them in these leggings .\nSince most leggings I own already make my butt look decent ( if I do say so myself ) , I thought my life was about to be dramatically changed forever .\nI was wrong .\nUnfortunately , I give these a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my particular body .\nThey somehow flattened my butt while accentuating my hips and lower belly fat , which are two things I tend to want my leggings to flatten .\nI usually like a thicker waistband to compress that whole middle area and create more of an hourglass shape .\nThe Seasum butt-lift leggings did not do that for me , nor did they lift my butt .\nThey were also a bit long for my liking , basically meeting the tops of my ankle socks , which was surprising in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height .\nSome reviewers were on my side here : \u201c I was betrayed by a TikTok .\nThese make my butt look like a pancake and I actually have a butt so don \u2019 t be fooled by the TikTok .\nThese ain \u2019 t it hunny.\n\u201d \u2014Jord Others said that they can be super flattering on some bodies : \u201c So , uhh , yeah .\nIf you have a big butt and a smaller waist , get these pants .\nI \u2019 m 5 ' 9 '' and 230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XL fit perfectly .\nI haven \u2019 t taken a thot picture since my early 20 \u2019 s , but these pants looked so good there needed to be proof.\n\u201d \u2014Haley Havoc I found the Halara leggings to be slightly more flattering .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they did anything magical , they gave me a bit better shape in the waist through the hips .\nThey did not transform my butt , but they also didn \u2019 t flatten it .\nI preferred the length of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job of hiding any dimples in the skin .\nI \u2019 d give them a more medium-to-low score on the flatter meter .\nThe Amazon leggings were far superior to Halara when it came to comfort .\nThey had much more stretch despite the equally thick and bubbled texture .\nThe waistband , though not as wide as I \u2019 d like , did fit comfortably snug around my waist without causing too much fat to protrude over the top .\nA well-summarized review : \u201c The material is super soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe color is beautiful and they are so comfortable .\nThey are true to size as well which is nice .\nI have to say that at first , it felt like I had a wedgie all day because of the seam but I got used to it .\nAnd yes , it definitely accentuates your butt .\nI am very modest so I would not wear these out of the house but they are so comfortable I actually think I want to buy some more.\n\u201d \u2014Robyn I knew of Halara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupes for trendy workout wear like the Outdoor Voices Exercise Dress , so I thought they would make comfortable leggings .\nHowever , I found these leggings to be difficult to pull on , and they felt strangely stiff for a piece of apparel designed to move in .\nThe top band was thick and a bit more flexible than the legs without that honeycomb texture , though it still didn \u2019 t have enough elastic to hug me the way I \u2019 d like .\nCan you exercise in TikTok leggings ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Seasum leggings won out .\nHowever , it \u2019 s important to note that most reviewers , and even a fitness expert , agree that functionality isn \u2019 t their strong suit .\n\u201c Do I think those leggings are leggings that I would wear to work out in ?\nAbsolutely not , \u201d Laura Pachnos , a senior coach at Solidcore in New York City , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Do I think they \u2019 re going to make you look great ?\nAbsolutely.\n\u201d I gave mine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y7 Studio .\nWhile they were admittedly not my favorite leggings to exercise in , they held up fine through the yoga flow .\nSince I opted for black , you couldn \u2019 t see any of the sweat even after 60 minutes of moving in a 90-degree room .\nAccording to Pachnos , who has a dance background and is certified in a wide variety of group fitness classes , it \u2019 s best to choose leggings specifically geared toward the type of workout you \u2019 ll be doing .\nSome may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tighter , or more supportive .\nUnless you plan to wear them only when lounging or running errands , they should have sweat-wicking technology .\nThe Amazon Seasum leggings do not have this feature .\n\u201c If you sweat in them , depending on the color , it looks like you peed yourself and feels heavy afterward , \u201d she said .\n( In case you were wondering , her favorites for any type of workout are from Sweaty Betty , which also has leggings that offer bum-sculpting benefits . )\nNearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seasum butt-lift leggings isn \u2019 t ideal for strenuous workouts , making them far better suited for lounging than exercise , but they were still miles ahead of Halara as far as functionality goes .\nI put on my Halara butt-lifting leggings for a workout with my trainer and almost immediately took them off .\nAfter moving my legs around a fairly minimal amount , I felt like the seam in the crotch might burst , which would not be ideal while doing squats and bear crawls at the gym .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable working out in them .\nGiven that the Halara leggings are more expensive than the Seasum leggings you can buy on Amazon and are only moderately more flattering ( in my opinion ) , I would buy them only if you heavily prioritize the butt-lifting appearance over everything else .\nOtherwise , I \u2019 d say the Seasum leggings are the way to go .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they were particularly flattering for my body type , many reviewers and TikTokers with other body types disagreed .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of wearing them for exercise .\n\u201c They are made for lounging , \u201d Pachnos said .\n\u201c If you were going to pair them with a cute chunky sweater and some Converse to go out for your morning coffee , that \u2019 s when I \u2019 d wear those leggings .\n\u201d",

using your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and sticking to set bedtimes and wake times .\nShelby Harris , a clinical psychologist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine , also notes that if you tend to bury your head under the covers or can \u2019 t resist repeated snooze sessions , this type of alarm clock may not be the right choice .\nIt all depends on your ideal sleep environment and where your sleeping or waking issues are stemming from .\nIf you tend to struggle to get out of bed when you \u2019 re forced to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you experience season-related mood changes in general , you may have seasonal affective disorder .\nWhile anyone can have the \u201c winter blues , \u201d about 5 % of people have seasonal affective disorder , otherwise known as SAD or seasonal depression , according to the American Psychiatric Association .\nSAD is a type of depression that \u2019 s most common in fall and winter months , when there are fewer hours of sunlight per day , although it can occur in summer in some people .\nPeople who have SAD experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and it \u2019 s more common in women than men .\nOne common treatment is light therapy , which often comes in the form of a specific type of lamp .\n\u201c Light has a physiological direct impact on our mood , \u201d which is why light therapy helps with seasonal depression , Robbins explained .\nSince many of these sunrise alarm clocks have adjustable brightness settings , it makes sense that they could also help with some symptoms of SAD .\nThat said , light therapy for SAD treatment usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to a lightbox with a brightness of 10,000 lux each morning or a lightbox with a brightness of 2,500 lux for one to two hours .\nSunrise alarm clocks tend to have a lux that \u2019 s 300 or lower .\nWhile gradual light from an alarm clock might help improve your mood and ability to wake up , follow your healthcare provider \u2019 s guidance for any light-related treatments if you \u2019 ve been diagnosed with SAD .\nWhen Dr. Dasgupta thinks about alarm clocks or any other device that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , he thinks of one patient population in particular \u2014 those with insomnia .\nWhile almost everyone experiences an inability to sleep at some point , he \u2019 s referring to those with chronic insomnia , which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines as having symptoms more than three times per week for up to three months .\nInsomnia generally involves difficulty initiating sleep and maintaining sleep throughout the night .\nWhile he emphasizes that the mainstay therapy for these issues is cognitive behavioral therapy , sunrise alarm clocks are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c You have to have all the right pieces to complete that puzzle to get that good sleep , \u201d he said .\n\u201c When people try different things to get good sleep , it really depends on what puzzle piece is missing.\n\u201d For some , that missing piece may be the comfort of a weighted blanket .\nFor others , a white noise machine may do the trick .\nBut if you \u2019 re sensitive to light and creating faux dawn sounds like a nicer way to wake than jarring beeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth trying out one of the clocks on this list .",

        "title": "Jurors In The Sarah Palin Trial Admitted They Saw News Alerts Before Reaching A Verdict. Here\u2019s Why That Might Be An Issue.",
        "content": "When a jury ruled in favor of the New York Times over Sarah Palin on Tuesday after hearing days of evidence as part of her defamation lawsuit against the newspaper , many legal and media observers were quick to say they expected the former Alaska governor to appeal .\nIndeed , the federal judge who presided over the case said as much himself when he , too , decided for the Times the day before .\nIn a surprising ruling that came some 24 hours before the jury reached its own verdict in the case , US District Court Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s claim as a matter of law no matter what the nine jurors decided .\nAs part of what is known as a directed verdict , Rakoff said he had concluded Palin \u2019 s attorneys failed to meet the legal standard of defamation by not proving that the Times staff acted with \u201c actual malice \u201d when they incorrectly asserted her political action committee incited a deadly shooting .\nImportantly , Rakoff never told the jurors about his decision and instead allowed them to keep deliberating .\nAware that news outlets were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repeated a warning to the jurors before they left for the day on Monday that he \u2019 d previously given them at the start of the trial : Avoid reading anything in the press about this high-profile case and instead come to your conclusions based solely on the evidence presented to you in court .\nBut in the smartphone era , that \u2019 s easier said than done .\nIn a new order in the case on Wednesday , Rakoff notified attorneys that several jurors told his law clerk after their verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his decision through news alerts on their phones .\n\u201c These jurors reported that although they had been assiduously adhering to the Court 's instruction to avoid media coverage of the trial , they had involuntarily received \u2018 push notifications \u2019 on their smartphones that contained the bottom-line of the ruling , \u201d he wrote .\nSeveral outlets , including BuzzFeed News and the New York Times itself , alerted readers to the judge \u2019 s decision via push alerts on Monday , although for these notifications to appear on phones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then have alerts enabled via their settings .\nThe jurors \u2014 who included , among others , a museum docent , a creative director , a receptionist , and a hedge fund worker \u2014 were not sequestered during their deliberations , meaning they were free to return home each night , albeit under strict instructions not to talk about the case or conduct their own research .\nBut the judge \u2019 s slightly unusual decision to rule on the motion to dismiss while the jury was deliberating invariably meant some jurors couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c A lot of people were saying that \u2019 s what was likely to happen , that the jury would find out , \u201d said University of Connecticut professor Alexandra Lahav , who studies procedural law .\n\u201c I guess the risk materialized.\n\u201d Lahav described this as a \u201c generational \u201d issue that perhaps the 78-year-old judge might not fully have considered .\n\u201c I think there were some people who thought automatically obviously the jury will get a push notification and others who didn \u2019 t , \u201d she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are very savvy with social media and smartphones , their minds immediately went to the smartphone thing.\n\u201d Lahav said she could not immediately recall another case where such an issue had arisen .\n\u201c I think this is a first , \u201d she said .\n\u201c At least I \u2019 ve never heard of it.\n\u201d In his Wednesday order , Rakoff stressed that the jurors had \u201c repeatedly assured \u201d his court that the notifications \u201c had not affected them in any way or played any role [ whatsoever ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neither party had objected to him ruling on the motion to dismiss while the jury was still deliberating .\nAt least one attorney had indicated there was a risk of jurors seeing push notifications , so the judge brought them in on Monday afternoon ostensibly under the guise to wish them a happy Valentine \u2019 s Day before reminding them to turn away from any headlines they might see about the case .\nPalin \u2019 s attorneys did not respond to a request for comment about whether the push notifications might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2nd Circuit .\nHowever , Lahav noted that any appeal would have to first be concerned with arguing Rakoff was wrong on the law in his actual malice ruling .\nThe judge had indicated that letting the jury reach a verdict of its own would mean that any appeals court could choose to simply reinstate the jury \u2019 s verdict , but now Palin \u2019 s attorneys might have a case to argue that they deserve a new trial altogether .\nBut Lahav said she did not expect such an argument to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that the jurors asked the judge on Tuesday while still deliberating as evidence that they were continuing to seriously consider the case .\nLahav was also unsurprised that both judge and jury ultimately found the Times not liable .\n\u201c Judges and juries agree about 80 % of the time on liability , so this seemed pretty standard stuff to me , \u201d she said .",

        "content": "PLANO , Texas \u2014 A federal magistrate has ordered Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes to remain in jail while he awaits trial for a series of charges including seditious conspiracy , citing his \u201c extreme defiance to federal authority \u201d and \u201c propensity toward violence.\n\u201d Prosecutors claim that Rhodes , 56 , \u201c spearheaded a conspiracy \u201d to prevent certification of the 2020 presidential election by encouraging the Oath Keepers to gather in Washington , DC , and to stash weapons and vehicles nearby for the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill protests that ended in a riot .\nIdentified for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Person One , \u201d Rhodes is described in charging documents as a fiery ringleader who allegedly began talking of violence and \u201c civil war \u201d just days after the 2020 election , spent some $ 40,000 on weapons and accessories prior to and following Jan. 6 , and attempted to destroy evidence of his involvement in the alleged plot after the fact .\nThe order was handed down late on Wednesday , two days after a hearing in federal court in Plano , Texas , where Rhodes has been held since his arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that he should not be released before trial , which has since been scheduled to begin July 11 in Washington , DC .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bIt is difficult to imagine conduct that poses a graver risk to our society than one targeted at undermining the laws and procedures at the heart of our democratic process \u2014 and doing so with force , \u201d Assistant US Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said before the packed courtroom .\nRhodes \u2019 attorney , Phillip Linder , argued that his client presented no danger to the community , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI agents who showed up with a search warrant to seize his phone last May and that he had even offered to travel to Washington to turn himself in should he ever be charged .\nLinder also questioned why the government waited so long to charge Rhodes , given that he had clearly been under scrutiny from investigators for nearly a year .\n\u201c To me , \u201d the Dallas-based attorney said , \u201c that speaks volumes.\n\u201d Reached by phone late Wednesday , James Lee Bright , Rhodes ' other attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her reasoning \u201d but that he was \u201c disappointed in the decision.\n\u201d That line of argument echoed conspiracy theories that have circulated widely in recent months suggesting that the government hadn \u2019 t charged Rhodes because he was an FBI informant and the entire Capitol riot was a false flag operation orchestrated by the government .\nAfter Rhodes was charged , some of those who helped spread those unproven theories said it was part of a cover-up to hide the truth about the Oath Keepers figurehead .\nRhodes , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yale Law School but was later disbarred , founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 .\nThe group , whose numbers include many current and former members of law enforcement and the military , gets its name from the oath those individuals swear to uphold the Constitution \u2014 and to disobey any orders or laws they feel contradict it .\nOver the past decade , Rhodes has led the group into a series of tense , highly politicized confrontations , including standoffs with federal law enforcement at rural land rights conflicts in Nevada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killings of Black Americans in Missouri , Kentucky , and elsewhere .\nHe has also been criticized for leaving some of his followers to face legal consequences while he walked away untouched .\nA longtime resident of Montana , he \u2019 s lived mostly in Texas for the past several years , often staying in the homes of fellow members of the Oath Keepers .\nIn her ruling to keep Rhodes detained , Magistrate Judge Kimberly Priest Johnson noted that Rhodes reported not filing federal income tax since approximately 2007 , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with \u201c limited personal effects and ties to Texas or any other community.\n\u201d Rhodes , who has been separated from his wife for four years , has been in a relationship with attorney Kellye SoRelle since May 2020 , the magistrate wrote .\nSoRelle , who identifies herself as the Oath Keepers \u2019 general counsel , said earlier this month that she was acting as the group \u2019 s president while Rhodes was detained .\nSoRelle , reached for comment , denied being in a relationship with Rhodes , saying she suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wanting to get released to my house.\n\u201d Prosecutors allege Rhodes commanded operations of the Oath Keepers in Washington on Jan. 6 .\nThey say that though he did not enter the Capitol , he was on the grounds and in close contact with the roughly two dozen Oath Keepers members and associates who pushed their way into the building using military-style \u201c stack \u201d formations .\nHe also was in communications with members of a \u201c Quick Reaction Force \u201d that had stockpiled weapons across the Potomac River in Virginia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District of Columbia .\nAt the end of that momentous day , Rakoczy noted , Rhodes gathered with other members of the Oath Keepers at an Olive Garden restaurant to celebrate .\nHe was indicted , along with 10 others , on Jan. 12 , and arrested outside of Fort Worth , Texas , late the following morning .\nOne of them , Edward Vallejo , was ordered detained last Thursday ; the other nine defendants had previously been charged in a related conspiracy case , and three have been behind bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , federal prosecutors have charged more than 725 people for their role in the events of Jan. 6 .\nBut there is little question that Rhodes is the most important target in what has emerged as the largest and most ambitious case to come out of the ongoing investigation .\nIn court on Monday , FBI agent Michael Palian testified about Rhodes \u2019 use of encrypted messages to direct the group and also said that the anti-government rhetoric he employed in the wake of the presidential election continued well after Jan. 6 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced by the defense \u2019 s argument that , based on his conduct over the past year , he was neither a flight risk nor a danger , she rejected a proposal to have him live with a \u201c third-party custodian \u201d \u2014 in this case a ride-hail driver from Dallas named Brian Bodine , who met Rhodes at a rally against COVID restrictions .\nAs an alternative , attorney Linder said , Rhodes could live at the house of a half cousin in rural California who could also serve as his custodian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive network of Oath Keepers members and other anti-government contacts means he is a flight risk who could \u201c go underground if he wanted to.\n\u201d Johnson agreed , stating that Rhodes \u201c is transient and may easily flee from federal authorities.\n\u201d Additionally , the magistrate said she took testimony after the Monday hearing from Rhodes \u2019 estranged wife , Tasha Adams , who said she \u201c feared for her safety and the safety of her six children \u201d if he were released .\nAdams , who lives in Montana and filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was physically abusive and in at least one instance \u201c choked the couple \u2019 s daughter , \u201d and that he built \u201c elaborate escape tunnels \u201d in their backyard , \u201c hid unregistered cars in the woods , \u201d and bought \u201c hundreds of dollars of razor wire \u201d that he intended to use to protect the property .\nThe detention ruling also confronted arguments on the right that the events of Jan. 6 amounted to nothing more than a First Amendment\u2013protected protest , or , as some have characterized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not faced with a peaceable assembly and petitioning , \u201d Johnson wrote .\nRhodes \u2019 \u201c extraordinary actions and the ripple effects that followed are outside the bounds of protected activities.\n\u201d Despite the magistrate \u2019 s ruling , Bright told BuzzFeed News that he planned to file a motion on Thursday morning asking Judge Amit Mehta in Washington to reconsider and grant Rhodes bond .\nMehta , who is overseeing all four of the Oath Keepers cases to come out of the Jan. 6 investigation , has allowed most of the roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay out of jail while they await trial .\nBut he denied bond to three individuals \u2014 Jessica Watkins , Kelly Meggs , and Kenneth Harrelson \u2014 whom he deemed too dangerous to be released last year .\nRegardless of whether Rhodes prevails in the matter of detention , his lawyer said he looks forward to taking the case to trial .\n\u201c An enormous amount of stuff that the public has never had the opportunity to hear is going to come out , \u201d Bright said .\n\u201c Unlike the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their context now , we \u2019 ll get the opportunity to challenge that .\n\u201d",

the best product to laminate my brows , I \u2019 m slathering it in on .\nAnd if every single person I see is wearing butt-lifting leggings that seem to make their rear look higher , firmer , and rounder than ever before , I \u2019 m buying them .\nWhen it came to the TikTok leggings , however , there were a few problems : 1 ) I am frugal by nature and refuse to spend money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) I kept seeing options that looked slightly different yet nobody was calling out brand names , and I had to know which pair was best , and 3 ) I needed to know if they could actually be worn during exercise .\nFor the sake of journalism , I decided to break my first rule and buy both the Amazon Seasum Butt Lift Tights and the Halara Butt Lifting Leggings ( which my research showed to be the two most popular leggings on TikTok ) .\nBefore we dive in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m more of a sweatpants-to-lounge , leggings-to-work-out kind of gal .\nI rarely wear leggings without at least the intention of exercising at some point in the day , so it \u2019 s important to me that they are comfortable , flattering , and functional , which are the three categories I used to evaluate the leggings popular on TikTok .\nYes , a flattering look is still important because most gyms and workout studios have mirrors , and seeing a reflection that makes me feel good can give me the confidence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in black .\nBlack and other similarly dark colors tend to be my default when it comes to leggings since I am a human who sweats when I work out .\nI prefer to not have that show through my pants , especially because that sweat generally comes through right around the crotch .\n( Although some high-quality colored leggings won \u2019 t show sweat either . )\nAs a 5-foot-6 woman , I \u2019 m slightly above average in height .\nI \u2019 ve been told that I have an athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , my butt is neither flat nor is it anything groundbreaking . )\nOverall I would call myself medium-size , but after looking at the sizing charts , reading some reviews , and knowing how I like my leggings to fit , I ordered a small in both pairs .\nYou can buy the Seasum High Waist Butt Lift Tights from Amazon for around $ 19 .\nYou can buy the In My Feels High Waisted Textured Butt Lifting 7/8 Leggings from Halara for around $ 28 .\nDo TikTok leggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that even Lizzo had gone with the Seasum butt-lifting leggings , I was understandably excited to try them out .\nI watched countless videos of people not only feeling themselves , but also filming the frankly shook reactions of their significant others upon seeing them in these leggings .\nSince most leggings I own already make my butt look decent ( if I do say so myself ) , I thought my life was about to be dramatically changed forever .\nI was wrong .\nUnfortunately , I give these a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my particular body .\nThey somehow flattened my butt while accentuating my hips and lower belly fat , which are two things I tend to want my leggings to flatten .\nI usually like a thicker waistband to compress that whole middle area and create more of an hourglass shape .\nThe Seasum butt-lift leggings did not do that for me , nor did they lift my butt .\nThey were also a bit long for my liking , basically meeting the tops of my ankle socks , which was surprising in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height .\nSome reviewers were on my side here : \u201c I was betrayed by a TikTok .\nThese make my butt look like a pancake and I actually have a butt so don \u2019 t be fooled by the TikTok .\nThese ain \u2019 t it hunny.\n\u201d \u2014Jord Others said that they can be super flattering on some bodies : \u201c So , uhh , yeah .\nIf you have a big butt and a smaller waist , get these pants .\nI \u2019 m 5 ' 9 '' and 230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XL fit perfectly .\nI haven \u2019 t taken a thot picture since my early 20 \u2019 s , but these pants looked so good there needed to be proof.\n\u201d \u2014Haley Havoc I found the Halara leggings to be slightly more flattering .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they did anything magical , they gave me a bit better shape in the waist through the hips .\nThey did not transform my butt , but they also didn \u2019 t flatten it .\nI preferred the length of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job of hiding any dimples in the skin .\nI \u2019 d give them a more medium-to-low score on the flatter meter .\nThe Amazon leggings were far superior to Halara when it came to comfort .\nThey had much more stretch despite the equally thick and bubbled texture .\nThe waistband , though not as wide as I \u2019 d like , did fit comfortably snug around my waist without causing too much fat to protrude over the top .\nA well-summarized review : \u201c The material is super soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe color is beautiful and they are so comfortable .\nThey are true to size as well which is nice .\nI have to say that at first , it felt like I had a wedgie all day because of the seam but I got used to it .\nAnd yes , it definitely accentuates your butt .\nI am very modest so I would not wear these out of the house but they are so comfortable I actually think I want to buy some more.\n\u201d \u2014Robyn I knew of Halara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupes for trendy workout wear like the Outdoor Voices Exercise Dress , so I thought they would make comfortable leggings .\nHowever , I found these leggings to be difficult to pull on , and they felt strangely stiff for a piece of apparel designed to move in .\nThe top band was thick and a bit more flexible than the legs without that honeycomb texture , though it still didn \u2019 t have enough elastic to hug me the way I \u2019 d like .\nCan you exercise in TikTok leggings ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Seasum leggings won out .\nHowever , it \u2019 s important to note that most reviewers , and even a fitness expert , agree that functionality isn \u2019 t their strong suit .\n\u201c Do I think those leggings are leggings that I would wear to work out in ?\nAbsolutely not , \u201d Laura Pachnos , a senior coach at Solidcore in New York City , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Do I think they \u2019 re going to make you look great ?\nAbsolutely.\n\u201d I gave mine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y7 Studio .\nWhile they were admittedly not my favorite leggings to exercise in , they held up fine through the yoga flow .\nSince I opted for black , you couldn \u2019 t see any of the sweat even after 60 minutes of moving in a 90-degree room .\nAccording to Pachnos , who has a dance background and is certified in a wide variety of group fitness classes , it \u2019 s best to choose leggings specifically geared toward the type of workout you \u2019 ll be doing .\nSome may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tighter , or more supportive .\nUnless you plan to wear them only when lounging or running errands , they should have sweat-wicking technology .\nThe Amazon Seasum leggings do not have this feature .\n\u201c If you sweat in them , depending on the color , it looks like you peed yourself and feels heavy afterward , \u201d she said .\n( In case you were wondering , her favorites for any type of workout are from Sweaty Betty , which also has leggings that offer bum-sculpting benefits . )\nNearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seasum butt-lift leggings isn \u2019 t ideal for strenuous workouts , making them far better suited for lounging than exercise , but they were still miles ahead of Halara as far as functionality goes .\nI put on my Halara butt-lifting leggings for a workout with my trainer and almost immediately took them off .\nAfter moving my legs around a fairly minimal amount , I felt like the seam in the crotch might burst , which would not be ideal while doing squats and bear crawls at the gym .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable working out in them .\nGiven that the Halara leggings are more expensive than the Seasum leggings you can buy on Amazon and are only moderately more flattering ( in my opinion ) , I would buy them only if you heavily prioritize the butt-lifting appearance over everything else .\nOtherwise , I \u2019 d say the Seasum leggings are the way to go .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they were particularly flattering for my body type , many reviewers and TikTokers with other body types disagreed .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of wearing them for exercise .\n\u201c They are made for lounging , \u201d Pachnos said .\n\u201c If you were going to pair them with a cute chunky sweater and some Converse to go out for your morning coffee , that \u2019 s when I \u2019 d wear those leggings .\n\u201d",

        "content": "\u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d In August 2021 , influencer Madison Vining made a big announcement on Instagram .\nAfter becoming one of the top sellers for the multilevel marketing essential oils company Young Living , she was quitting .\nTo her more than 250,000 followers on Instagram and her Young Living team , known as the \u201c Happy Oilers , \u201d the news came as a huge shock .\nYoung Living is one of two of the major essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorker reported in 2017 , along with its main rival DoTerra ( both claim to be the largest oils company in the world , according to the magazine ) .\nBoth reportedly reach $ 1 billion in sales annually and serve millions of customers .\nVining , who had worked for Young Living for more than eight years , had reached \u201c Royal Crown Diamond \u201d status ; sellers with that status make , on average , $ 1,645,692 annually or $ 137,000 a month , according to the company .\nPeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vining and her husband , Tyler , would leave so much money on the table to start from scratch .\nWhen , a few days later , the Vinings announced that they were joining a new wellness-focused MLM , Modere , which is best known for its collagen supplements , rumors swirled that the couple had gotten a huge payout or some other incentive to leave .\nFor months Vining had kept her reasons for leaving Young Living opaque .\nBut recently , she finally began to spill the tea on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave for leaving Young Living ?\nSatan and his demons .\nYes , the prince of darkness .\nVining is just one former top Young Living retailer who this month has either insinuated or flat-out said that they left the company after feeling , as devout Christians , that demonic forces were spreading \u201c darkness \u201d among Young Living members .\nOne former seller , Melissa Truitt , went as far as labeling the company a \u201c cult \u201d in an Instagram story highlight she posted to her account last week and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oily \u201c satanic panic \u201d by posting her series of Instagram stories last week accusing the company of spreading \u201c demonic \u201d propaganda through a New Age self-help book it sent to its members earlier this year .\nShe urged Christians still working for Young Living to flee or risk their souls .\n\u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d Truitt said in an emotional Instagram story .\nTruitt did not return a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not either , and shortly after I reached out , she blocked me on Instagram .\nIn response to the claims , Young Living said it \u201c did not publish and does not endorse this book in any way.\n\u201d In a statement , the company said that the book \u2019 s co-author , Marcella Vonn Harting , who is a top seller at the company , sent the book to \u201c her own list without the company \u2019 s knowledge or consent.\n\u201d The company denied providing Vonn Harting with anyone \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not return a request for comment ) .\n\u201c We support a culture of inclusion that we extend to our employees , customers , and brand partners world-wide , \u201d the statement read .\n\u201c We appreciate and celebrate our members and their diversity of background and belief , and are dedicated to ensuring our brand partners follow our policies and procedures and code of ethics.\n\u201d The influencers and former Young Living retailers \u2019 abrupt declarations that the company is satanic are odd to say the least , especially as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jumped ship to Modere over the past several months , before even receiving the book .\nTruitt , who had reached the second-highest \u201c Diamond \u201d status , also left Young Living five months ago to join Modere .\nAnd other big Young Living sellers slash influencers , like Liz Joy of Pure Joy Home and Monique McLean , abruptly announced they were switching to Modere recently as well .\nIn fact , so many prominent top Young Living sellers have been leaving that last August Young Living sued some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , for breach of contract .\nThe lawsuit , which was filed in federal court in Utah in August 2021 , was dismissed that December at the request of both sides .\nStill , it provides valuable insight into the breakup of the prominent Instagram essential oil sellers and the company .\nIn the complaint , Young Living accused the McLeans and the Vinings of working to cut a deal with Modere to \u201c raid \u201d Young Living \u2019 s business .\n( McLean did not return a request for comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for comment . )\n\u201c The named defendants in this case are former , extremely successful Young Living distributors who have meticulously executed a plan to leave Young Living , join a competing business venture , and take as many Young Living distributors and customers with them as possible , \u201d the lawsuit \u2019 s complaint read .\nYoung Living declined to comment on the lawsuit .\nBut now , the influencers are saying that money or alleged backdoor schemes had nothing to do with their decision to leave .\nVining wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the \u201c tip of the iceberg on this issue , \u201d and she feels better after \u201c denouncing this spiritual darkness \u201d to her followers .\n\u201c I feel a lot of clarity breaking my silence for things that matter in eternity , \u201d she wrote .\nThe denouncement of Young Living as demonic is especially intriguing because so many of its retailers , Vining included , have spent the past several years blending together the principles of alternative wellness and medicine the company espouses with their evangelical Christian beliefs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1993 by D. Gary Young , a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who successfully blended his own devout faith with a lifelong passion for alternative remedies .\nIn a newsletter to Young Living members after her husband \u2019 s death in 2018 , Gary \u2019 s wife , Mary , wrote that her husband \u2019 s desire to spread the gospel of essential oils was closely tied to his faith , writing , \u201c God was his foundation.\n\u201d \u201c He founded the essential oil movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never stopped in his desire to serve God \u2019 s children , \u201d Young wrote .\nFor many years , alternative remedies like essential oils were stereotyped to be the purview of hippie-dippie rich people , but , as Rachel Monroe wrote in the New Yorker in 2017 , essential oils have also caught on more broadly among women all over the US .\n\u201c Wellness is often dismissed as frivolity , another way for wealthy white women to spend money and obsess about their bodies , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find essential oils in a small-town drugstore in the Midwest as in an organic market in L.A. \u201d Over the past decade or so , many of the devotees who made it big in Young Living shared similarities with Vining .\nThey were young wives and mothers in the heartland who were devoted evangelical Christians , and they also seemed to have a suspicion of mainstream medicine .\nAccording to Vining , once she stopped buying mainstream medicinal and home products and dove into essential oils , her life changed dramatically .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family had decided to start a \u201c wellness journey \u201d three years before after learning about \u201c the dangers lurking in our home that were making us sick.\n\u201d \u201c There are ingredients in everyday things like baby lotion , dish soap , dryer sheets\u2026 all linked to cancer , infertility , and disease .\nWe just didn \u2019 t know , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c We slowly but surely took a trash bag through our home and began to read labels .\nInto the trash bag went candles , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was setting us or our kiddos up for failure with our health.\n\u201d Vining never specified what ingredients exactly were making her family sick but claimed that once she threw out the products she saw a huge difference .\nAnd once she found Young Living and began using oils , Vining claimed , her family no longer needed to rely on \u201c toxic \u201d Western medicine .\n\u201c We use essential oils for everything in our home , from seasonal irritations outdoors , to first aid type of things , to helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good stuff , and of course restful sleep !\n\u201d she wrote .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve blessed our family so so much.\n\u201d As the Vinings \u2019 platform grew ( in 2017 , Vining wrote she had 58,000 people under her in the business ) , the couple used the proceeds from their essential oil business to spread the gospel of Jesus , effectively combining the two parts of her life .\n\u201c Our prayer has always been that we would use our influence to point everything back to The One who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c We know that this money and this opportunity and this voice have not been given to us because of anything WE have done , and they are not ours.\n\u201d In 2017 , Vining and another Young Living seller made a goal to get Young Living oils into a school in Uganda that was founded by an American evangelical Christian missionary .\nThe Vinings and their partners were eventually able to raise enough funds to get oils and diffusers into every dorm room and classroom at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students \u201c appropriate wellness supplies to prevent icky diseases and unwellness , \u201d Vining wrote .\nShe felt that this plan was a calling from God .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about more than oils , you guys , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s ALWAYS been about so much more than oils .\nIt \u2019 s about \u2018 wellness , purpose , and abundance \u2019 ( YL \u2019 s slogan ) and it \u2019 s about using ANY platform we are given , to glorify the King.\n\u201d Vining \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career on social media , where she became a prominent Young Living influencer .\nAs her prominence within the \u201c oiler community \u201d grew , so did her online presence , and she went from having 56,000 Instagram followers in September 2018 to more than 200,000 when she quit the company in August 2021 .\nMany other Young Living sellers also found success on social media , where they were able to share their devout faith and their enviable lifestyles while also recruiting new downlines , or Young Living retailers who report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Crown Diamond who was sued by Young Living along with the Vinings last year , grew her platform to more than 29,000 Instagram followers and launched a book and video series called 24 Days of Prayer for Your Business .\nIn the series , McLean led followers virtually on a spiritual devotional aimed at centering their faith in their business ventures , Young Living or otherwise .\nTruitt , who has more than 43,000 Instagram followers , is also open about her Christian faith , often discussing her religion along with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellness , and fitness .\nIt is because these oil peddlers connected their spirituality so closely with their careers that their sudden insistence that the company is now somehow anti-Christian has been so jarring .\nBut according to the oilers , after years of success in Young Living they had begun to feel a darkness creep into the company and that \u2019 s what led them to leave .\nLast week , Truitt kicked off the public drama when she posted a series of Instagram stories about issues she had had with Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven good years of selling Young Living and reaching the second-highest Diamond status , she and her husband began to feel like the company was \u201c changing , \u201d and not for the better .\nTruitt didn \u2019 t specify what these changes were , saying they \u201c couldn \u2019 t really pinpoint it , \u201d but \u201c we heard things that didn \u2019 t really agree with our spirit.\n\u201d After praying about it , they decided to resign from Young Living at the end of 2021 .\n\u201c We knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , \u201d she said .\nTruitt said that , despite having resigned last fall , she received a \u201c demonic \u201d book in the mail earlier this month that she thought was sent from Young Living .\nShe said the company had sent it to all its Diamond-level sellers and claimed that Mary Young , the wife of the late founder , had encouraged the leaders to read the book and pass it along to their downlines .\nThe book , titled My Word Made Flesh , is cowritten by a self-help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a company called Mastery Systems ( Stevens did not return a request for comment ) .\nStevens describes himself on his website as a \u201c masterful facilitator of individuals and organizations that choose to transform their lives into healthy , creative , loving and fulfilling experiences.\n\u201d Stevens wrote the book with Vonn Harting , a Young Living Royal Crown Diamond who moonlights as a motivational speaker , and Young wrote the foreword .\nThe spokesperson for Young Living said Young \u2019 s choice to contribute to the book was separate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Young \u2019 s choice to write a foreword stemmed from her own belief about the use of language to promote positive outcomes and her desire to support a friend , \u201d they said .\n\u201c She wrote her foreword prior to much of the book even being written based on the authors \u2019 intent to teach people how to use positive language to help bring about change in their lives.\n\u201d I attempted to get a copy of My Word Made Flesh to see what it actually contained , but after placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mastery Systems \u2019 website , my order was canceled and refunded with no explanation .\nMy Word Made Flesh has now been scrubbed from the website .\nAccording to Truitt , when she received the book and flipped through it , she was horrified .\n\u201c This book is one of the most darkest and demonic books I \u2019 ve ever had in my house , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I can not wait to get rid of it but I had to share.\n\u201d In Truitt \u2019 s video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says is My Word Made Flesh .\nThe \u201c demonic \u201d elements of the book , Truitt claimed , include encouraging people to do basically a \u201c seance with oils \u201d and telling them to repeat \u201c I am the resurrection and the life of my lineage.\n\u201d In the Bible , Jesus calls himself \u201c the way , the truth and the life , \u201d and says \u201c no one comes to the Father [ God ] except through me.\n\u201d To Christians like Truitt , she explained , the book \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to imply you are supplanting Jesus \u2019 s spot .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing more false than that , \u201d she says in her Instagram story .\n\u201c Then taking Jesus out of it and putting yourself in there.\n\u201d Truitt warned \u201c believers \u201d who were still in Young Living that if they did what the company asked and brought the book into their household , \u201c it will completely ruin you.\n\u201d \u201c Leaders of Young Living , you received this book , and so if you are hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condoning this evil , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And if you promote it , you need a serious heart check.\n\u201d \u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And you have to stand up and rise up and run from this.\n\u201d Vining soon posted on her Instagram stories in support of Truitt , saying that she was proud of Truitt for sharing \u201c the truth.\n\u201d \u201c Believers be discerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy [ Satan ] prowls like a lion , and he can look ( and smell ) really good\u2026 this isn \u2019 t about a book .\nThough that book alone would have been a deal breaker for me\u2026 this is the tip of the iceberg on this issue.\n\u201d Vining added she was praying for clarity to speak out more about her experience with Young Living but knew she had to denounce this \u201c spiritual darkness.\n\u201d The reaction from Truitt \u2019 s community to her denouncement of Young Living was overwhelmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and for speaking out against \u201c evil.\n\u201d One woman wrote she had considered signing up for Young Living but would not after seeing Truitt \u2019 s stories .\nPeople also slammed Young Living on social media after Truitt spoke out , saying they were blending \u201c oils and the occult.\n\u201d \u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d wrote one .\nOther Instagram accounts , like Christian podcast host Blake Guichet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company is \u201c anti-Biblical.\n\u201d Guichet had previously posted \u201c deep dives \u201d into the supposed darkness in Young Living and said she wasn \u2019 t surprised to see Truitt \u2019 s stories .\n\u201c I knew Young Living was into some dark stuff , and everyone thought I was crazy , \u201d she said .\nSince posting about the book , Truitt has erased all mention of her claims from her account .\nShe continues to post memes about spiritual warfare , uploading a C.S .\nLewis quote that reads : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe .\nEvery square inch , every split second is claimed by God , and counterclaimed by Satan.\n\u201d Both Truitt and Vining are now preaching the benefits of their new company Modere , which you can swipe up on their accounts to buy , or even sell , products from if you choose .\n\u201c God did design our bodies to move , \u201d Truitt wrote on Instagram stories , adding , \u201c I have been using Modere products for a while and it \u2019 s just been so different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just flowing out of me.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Young Living \u2019 s social accounts have so far been silent on the controversy .\nThey continue to post about the benefits of oils , encouraging their 1 million followers to \u201c focus on you by taking some time out to practice mindfulness with your favorite essential oil blend.\n\u201d Their followers filled up their comments section with hearts .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "\u201c This isn \u2019 t an assembly line .\nThis is actually people , \u201d said one former therapist .\nFeeling stressed and overwhelmed last January , Daniel Rojas decided to take advantage of a benefit Starbucks often touts for its employees around the country : free therapy through Lyra Health , a mental health startup that provides counseling services for some of the biggest companies in the world .\nRojas , a 25-year-old shift supervisor in Buffalo , New York , had been dealing with gender dysphoria and body image problems , two issues he says compound each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d So Rojas jumped at the coffee giant \u2019 s offer of 20 free counseling sessions from Lyra , a Silicon Valley darling cofounded and led by former Facebook CFO David Ebersman .\nBut four sessions in , Rojas , who uses he/they pronouns , felt frustrated with the progress of their treatment .\nHe said he had to constantly re-explain things he \u2019 d gone over in previous sessions , which made him relive the same traumas every time he had to repeat them .\nSo they decided to end treatment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyra \u2019 s platform .\nWhen they attempted to find someone else , though , they said a Lyra rep told them in a video call that their issues were too advanced for the company \u2019 s care .\nThe rep suggested he seek long-term treatment elsewhere and left him to figure it out on his own .\n\u201c I work really hard at Starbucks and I want to get every benefit I possibly can , \u201d Rojas said .\n\u201c I felt alienated .\nI felt like I was being cheated.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for comment on Rojas \u2019 s situation , and Lyra declined to address it .\nStarbucks bills its Lyra benefit as \u201c mental healthcare for a wide-range of needs , from mild to complex.\n\u201d But Rojas \u2019 s experience reveals one way patients can feel underserved by a startup aiming to be a model for \u201c modern mental healthcare.\n\u201d In interviews with BuzzFeed News , 18 users , therapists , and former Lyra employees voiced concerns about some of the company \u2019 s business practices , including its productivity-based bonus structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data .\nSome of the people who spoke to BuzzFeed News for this story did so under the condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions from their employers or former employers .\nLyra \u2014 whose juggernaut slate of corporate clients also includes Google , Facebook parent Meta , and Morgan Stanley \u2014 is one of the leaders in a wave of startups focusing on mental health , applying Silicon Valley \u2019 s data-absorbed ethos to the discipline of therapy .\nTech giants like Facebook and Google often weather criticism for taking liberties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business model behind startups such as Lyra has received less scrutiny .\nThe company , which has raised $ 700 million in funding to date , generates revenue through deals with high-profile companies , using anonymized patient data to prove it provides worthwhile benefits .\nBetter access to therapy , of course , is a good thing .\nLyra \u2019 s supporters cite good wages for therapists , a well-built software platform , and the awareness the company has brought to people who might not have otherwise sought therapy .\nOther mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health , and Cerebral , have also become workplace staples , especially throughout a global pandemic .\n( BuzzFeed has a relationship with Ginger to offer mental health benefits to employees . )\nAs more people entrust this burgeoning class of therapy apps with their well-being , the tech industry \u2019 s growth-at-all-costs outlook may not translate well to a field as delicate as mental health .\nLyra \u2019 s prominence raises questions about whether a high-flying Silicon Valley startup \u2019 s need to justify its reported $ 4.6 billion valuation conflicts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services .\nLyra spokesperson Dyani Vanderhorst said in a statement , \u201c Our approach makes it easy for millions of people to access high-quality mental healthcare .\nAs demand accelerates , we remain committed to delivering clinically proven , outcomes-based mental healthcare for employees and their dependents across all facets of mental health.\n\u201d \u201c It Can Get Dicey In Terms Of Ethics \u201d Ebersman founded Lyra Health seven years ago in Burlingame , California , about 20 miles south of San Francisco .\nThe former Facebook executive , who was previously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Zuckerberg \u2019 s social network , said he decided to start Lyra after having a difficult experience finding care for a family member .\n( Lyra declined to make Ebersman available for an interview . )\nThe startup employs its own therapists while also tapping into a network of contractors .\nWhen a company hires Lyra to be an Employee Assistance Program ( EAP ) , its employees are typically given a set number of free sessions per year to see a counselor .\nThe original plan was to offer users unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , though that policy was later changed .\nThe clinicians on Lyra \u2019 s platform specialize in evidence-based \u201c blended care \u201d therapy , a mix of in-person or live-video sessions and digital lessons and other content .\nAfter employees use all of their free sessions , they can continue seeing their Lyra therapist by paying out of pocket or through health insurance .\nWhen it comes to clinical work , the company puts an emphasis on efficiency .\nThe startup \u2019 s in-house therapists are entitled to bonuses based on productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BuzzFeed News , which is measured through a range of goals , including symptoms improving over time based on patient surveys .\nOne of the former therapists , Megha Reddy , said the bonus model can push therapists into \u201c churning out \u201d patients quickly .\nReddy , who worked at Lyra until 2019 , said the system can encourage questionable behavior , and could incentivize therapists to not see a patient for more than a certain number of sessions .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t an assembly line .\nThis is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can \u2019 t just throw people in and expect them to see results.\n\u201d Vanderhorst , the Lyra spokesperson , didn \u2019 t answer specific questions about the bonus system or what changes may have been made to it , but said in a statement , \u201c We take great care in creating a supportive and dynamic work experience for our providers as well as offering them fair compensation.\n\u201d As a part-time employee working 20 hours a week at Lyra , Reddy said she was expected to see 12 to 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a whole new slate of patients every six to 10 weeks .\nThe financial incentives create the potential for abuse , she said .\nHer discomfort with the bonus system was her main reason for leaving Lyra .\n\u201c It can get dicey in terms of ethics , \u201d Reddy said .\n\u201c You \u2019 re not going to dictate to me when a patient is supposed to feel better based on numbers .\nThat \u2019 s going to be based on the patient and my discretion.\n\u201d Vanderhorst said providers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient needs .\nArthur Caplan , head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine , said a bonus system like the one used by Lyra makes him \u201c nervous.\n\u201d \u201c It could be a conflict of interest , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Turnover as a measure of success is certainly dubious in mental healthcare.\n\u201d Facebook , Google , and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on Lyra \u2019 s bonus structure , and Starbucks did not respond to multiple requests for comment .\nOther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity from therapists .\nIn December , Forbes reported that Cerebral had reclassified salaried therapists as contractors , making access to medical , vision , and dental benefits contingent on meeting quotas .\n\u201c This was done so that our best and most productive therapists have the opportunity to earn more , \u201d CEO Kyle Robertson said in response .\nCerebral did not respond to a request for comment .\nBut while other apps engage in similar practices when it comes to data policies and productivity incentives , Lyra Health bears some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the space , two former employees said .\n\u201c We set the tone , \u201d said one of them .\n\u201c We basically started an industry.\n\u201d Ebersman has said he wants to bring some of Facebook \u2019 s data-centric approach to mental health .\n\u201c One of the things that \u2019 s so magical about Facebook is how the experience is completely personalized , \u201d Ebersman said when Lyra launched in 2015 .\n\u201c And that is generally absent from your experience in healthcare.\n\u201d To collect data on the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c outcomes surveys.\n\u201d The questionnaires inquire , for example , about things like anxiety or irritability over the last two weeks , asking patients to rank their intensity from 0 to 3 , according to surveys viewed by BuzzFeed News .\nThe surveys , which use clinically accepted and standardized questions , are optional .\nBut patients may feel compelled to complete them because the automated emails look like they are coming from their therapist .\nClinicians can use the data to help shape their treatment , but there \u2019 s another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company shares aggregated and anonymized data about patient outcomes with employers to illustrate the effectiveness of its services .\nIn one version of the survey viewed by BuzzFeed News that is hosted on research.net , a disclosure that explains how Lyra shares aggregated and anonymous outcomes data with employers appears on page three of five .\nAnother version of the survey accessed through Google \u2019 s internal Lyra portal and viewed by BuzzFeed News does not explicitly say that outcomes data will be shared .\nInstead , it reads : \u201c Your responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employer sponsoring your Lyra benefit.\n\u201d Lyra declined to answer questions about how it currently discloses to patients that it shares outcomes data with employers .\nGoogle and Starbucks confirmed they receive data from Lyra in order to judge the service \u2019 s value to employees .\n\u201c Google does not access the medical records of people using Lyra Health , and we have no special access , \u201d Google spokesperson Jennifer Rodstrom said in a statement .\nFacebook and Morgan Stanley declined to comment .\nOutcomes data is so central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s previous name was Outcome Health , according to an internal document viewed by BuzzFeed News .\nThe name was changed to Lyra Health prior to the company \u2019 s launch .\n\u201c The bottom line is , this is a business .\nSo the bottom line is money , \u201d said one former Lyra employee who worked on the company \u2019 s clinical team .\n\u201c And how can you get money ?\nBy data .\nBy saying , \u2018 Look how successful we are .\nPlease invest in us.\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former Google , Facebook , and Starbucks employees who saw Lyra therapists and were upset about the sharing of outcomes data .\nOne former Facebook employee , who worked on privacy initiatives at the tech giant , was concerned the data could be abused even if aggregated and anonymized .\n\u201c I understand that employers want to measure the efficacy of their programs , \u201d the former employee said , but it \u2019 s \u201c completely inappropriate \u201d to share such sensitive data .\nAside from the disclosure on some surveys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a privacy policy , a more than 5,000-word document that lives at the bottom of its website .\nThe company says the data sharing complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) , which regulates the use of health information .\nThe company \u2019 s HIPAA notice , also found at the bottom of its website , says Lyra shares patient data \u201c to support our business operations.\n\u201d Vanderhorst said new users must acknowledge both the privacy policy and HIPAA notice while setting up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known about the data sharing .\nOf the seven current and former Google , Facebook , and Starbucks employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News , all but one of them said they did not know the data from these surveys could be shared with employers in any form .\n\u201c It \u2019 s shocking to me , \u201d said a former Google employee , who said she didn \u2019 t remember a data disclosure while filling out the surveys .\n\u201c I had no idea they were doing that.\n\u201d Lyra defended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients .\n\u201c Lyra follows all U.S. regulations regarding privacy , \u201d Vanderhorst said in a statement .\n\u201c Our privacy policy is standard format and provides detailed information about our practices.\n\u201d Jennifer King , privacy and data policy fellow at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence , said there \u2019 s the legal process of gathering consent , and then there \u2019 s \u201c the moral question \u201d of making sure people fully understand .\nThe added layer of sharing information with an employer makes it even more problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better with aggregation , but in the workplace is different , \u201d she said .\nLyra isn \u2019 t the only company in the mental health space facing questions about what it \u2019 s doing with anonymous user data .\nLoris.ai , the partner company to the nonprofit Crisis Text Line , is contending with criticism after Politico reported that it uses anonymous but sensitive data drawn from conversations on the text-based suicide hotline for business purposes .\nSome Lyra therapists were not aware Lyra shares outcomes data with employers , either .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyra therapists , and six of them said they did not know about the data sharing .\nThe therapists said meaningful consent from patients is crucial , even though their names are not attached to the data .\nSome patients and therapists didn \u2019 t mind the data being shared anonymously , since it might be valuable for a company to know if its workforce is depressed or riddled with anxiety .\nBut one former Lyra therapist says patients should get to choose what they want shared .\n\u201c They should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their outcomes to be reported , \u201d she said .\nData collection was a key issue for some therapists during the early days of the company , according to three former Lyra employees .\nThey said concerns about data sharing made it difficult to recruit therapists to work with Lyra when the company was getting started .\nWhen company leadership was told about those hesitations , they were dismissive of the concerns , the former employees said .\n\u201c Lyra has tremendous respect for the clinical knowledge , experience , and expertise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement .\n\u201c Provider recruitment and retention are essential to the care we provide members and the success of our organization.\n\u201d The company has also had a history of its clinicians feeling overlooked , two former employees said .\nWhile engineering and data teams were valued for their input , people on the clinical team were treated like \u201c second-class citizens , \u201d one of the former employees said .\nThat employee said that culture was instilled as Ebersman began to bring in people who used to work at Facebook .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook declined to comment .\nChelsey Glasson , a former Google and Facebook employee , has recently sounded the alarm on EAPs like Lyra and the potential conflict of interest that could occur when your employer pays for your therapist .\nIn an October op-ed for Insider , she called for more transparency in the relationship between third-party mental health providers and employers .\nGlasson , who is suing Google after alleged pregnancy discrimination , had sought session notes from her Lyra therapist as part of the lawsuit .\nGoogle then demanded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Glasson said , her therapist called and indicated she was no longer comfortable seeing her .\nGoogle declined to comment .\nGlasson \u2019 s former therapist didn \u2019 t respond to multiple requests for comment .\nIn Lyra \u2019 s privacy policy , the company says it can use personal information to \u201c comply with our legal obligations.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s all inappropriate and unethical , \u201d Glasson said of Lyra \u2019 s business practices .\n\u201c People have no idea this is happening.\n\u201d Glasson , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her therapist , and the situation is now under investigation by the Washington State Department of Health , according to emails viewed by BuzzFeed News .\nAfter consulting with Glasson , Washington State Sen. Karen Keiser sent a letter in November to the state \u2019 s secretary of health about the \u201c potential conflict \u201d between employees and employers that participate in EAPs , according to a copy of the letter viewed by BuzzFeed News .\nThen , in December , Keiser pre-filed legislation that aims to give workers more rights when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called SB 5564 , would prohibit employers from disciplining workers based on their decision to see \u2014 or not see \u2014 a therapist through an EAP .\nIt would also make it illegal for an employer to obtain individually identifiable information about an employee .\nA state senate committee discussed the bill at a hearing last month .\n\u201c Our huge technology companies do n't hold personal privacy with the same regard that I think they should , \u201d Keiser told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been data mining personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bottom line .\nBut when they use it on their employees , that \u2019 s a whole different thing .\nIt \u2019 s really a big brother kind of approach.\n\u201d Lyra \u2019 s policies have at least some people wary about seeking therapy through their employers .\nAfter Glasson \u2019 s experience with her therapist was reported by the New York Times in July , some Google workers became less likely to use the EAP services provided by Lyra , said the Alphabet Workers Union , which represents workers for Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment .\n\u201c I was surprised when I heard about her story , \u201d said a former Google employee .\n\u201c It really shed a lot of light on the relationship that the counselor has with the company.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "While pandemic-related stress , anxiety , and grief due to the more than 900,000 COVID deaths in the US have had a well-documented impact on mental health , changes in daily life , like staying home for extended periods of time , can also affect other parts of your body , including your eyes , skin , and ability to focus .\nBuzzFeed News spoke to several doctors and experts about how spending more time at home can transform bodies in the short and long term .\nSpending more time indoors is known to increase the risk of nearsightedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in JAMA Ophthalmology suggested that during the pandemic , there were 1.4 to 3 times more cases of myopia in 2020 among children ages 6 to 8 than in the previous five years .\nThat wasn \u2019 t the case for kids ages 9 to 13 , who didn \u2019 t experience increases in myopia diagnoses .\nThe link is less studied in adults , but Dr. Mika Moy , an eye doctor and health sciences clinical professor at the University of California , Berkeley School of Optometry , said she isn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients .\nHowever , close work ( spending hours reading or looking at something less than 20 centimeters , or about 7 to 8 inches distance from your face ) coupled with low light levels are thought to play a role in increased myopia risk .\n\u201c There 's other sort of generalizations , like people who live in cities tend to be more nearsighted than people who live in the country , and we think that 's because we 're finding there 's a protective connection with the outdoors , \u201d Moy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only eye-related problem that \u2019 s occurring during the pandemic .\nFor eyes , lockdowns in March 2020 were like having to \u201c run marathons without any training , \u201d Moy told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Your meetings are on the screen , your work is on the screen , and now everyone 's leisure time seems to also be on these screens.\n\u201d Often people forget to blink when staring at a screen for a long time , which deprives their eyes of moisturizing tears .\nWe \u2019 re also stressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that secrete oil into our tears every time we blink .\nBlinking less can cause the glands to \u201c shrink away , \u201d Moy said , which isn \u2019 t good in the long run .\nEye drops called artificial tears can help relieve dryness , but they may not work as well as warm compresses .\nMoy suggests placing a warm washcloth over your eyes for 10 minutes about two times a day to feel relief .\nYou can also develop eye fatigue , which occurs when the muscles that control your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ; some people may get headaches or experience blurry vision as a result , Moy said .\nBlue light exposure is another factor to consider , which electronic devices emit .\nIt has one of the shorter yet higher energy wavelengths on the visible light spectrum , but experts agree there isn \u2019 t strong scientific evidence that shows it actually causes eye fatigue or damage .\n( Too much of it at night can make it harder for you to fall asleep , though , Moy said . )\nSo yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from staring at your computer all day , but the infamous blue light probably isn \u2019 t the culprit here .\nIn fact , the sun produces at least 100 times more blue light than a typical smartphone , the American Optometric Association says .\nThis means your fancy blue light glasses may not be doing much ; the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn \u2019 t recommend them .\nAnecdotally , however , Moy said her patients think they \u2019 re helpful ( personally , I think so , too , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne pair of glasses that might help are computer glasses , or \u201c occupational lenses , \u201d which are prescription frames that correct your vision specifically for computer-length distance , preventing your eyes from working too hard .\nThere are also some nonprescription reading glasses that are specifically made for computer work .\nOne of the best things you can do is give your eyes a break and try the 20-20-20 rule : every 20 minutes look 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds .\nOtherwise , take some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more ways than one .\nAlthough being indoors can protect you from sunburns and major risks of skin cancer from exposure to ultraviolet light , your vitamin D levels can drop because you \u2019 re not absorbing sunlight that helps your body produce it , notes Dr. Elizabeth Bahar Houshmand , a double board-certified dermatologist in Texas .\nVitamin D supports immune health , muscle function , brain activity , and the absorption of important minerals such as calcium , magnesium , and phosphate .\nStudies show vitamin D deficiency is associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone and muscle issues ( more on that later ) , and other health problems .\nA lack of sunlight exposure , darker skin , and older age increase your chances of having a deficiency .\nThe good news is that at least one 2021 study published in the European Journal of Public Health found that vitamin D deficiency was no more common in patients in Italy during 2020 lockdowns compared with previous years , suggesting it may not always be an issue for those of us spending extra time at home during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of sun exposure is necessary for your body to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D. Stepping outside for \u201c a few minutes a day is enough , \u201d Dr. Joshua Zeichner , director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , told BuzzFeed News .\nYou can also get your vitamin D from fortified foods , supplements , and certain foods like salmon and egg yolks .\nWhat both dermatologists have noticed during the pandemic is more patients coming in with rashes , acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes facial redness and pimplelike bumps on the skin .\nZeichner blames face masks , stress , and poor eating habits ( namely , eating too much sugar ) .\nSugar can promote inflammation in the body and drive oil production that can lead to acne breakouts , he said .\nOver time , excess sugar can trigger glycation \u2014 when sugar molecules attach to proteins in your skin called collagen \u2014 which can contribute to wrinkles , he said .\nRegular exercise can help .\nIt keeps your skin cells functioning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeichner said .\n\u201c The days may seem long and repetitive , but keep up with your skincare routine , \u201d he said .\n\u201c What you do now certainly will have an impact on your skin in the future.\n\u201d Then there \u2019 s a less obvious but still insidious impact on your body ( and mind ) .\nPeople are spending more time in Zoom meetings where staring at themselves in the harsh glare of a computer is making them more self-conscious about the way they look .\nBoth dermatologists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get rid of dark spots , wrinkles , and undereye bags .\nZeichner recommends wearing sunscreen , even indoors because harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can still pierce through windows and penetrate your skin .\nVarious stress-inducing pollutants also exist inside your home , Houshmand said , especially in the winter when central heating and lack of fresh air can dry your skin ; she recommends setting up a humidifier in your home to help .\nIf you \u2019 re anything like Michel , the 23-year-old with back trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains associated with turning your home into a workspace .\nDr. Charla Fischer , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News she \u2019 s seeing more patients come in with back pain related to poor posture while working from home .\n\u201c We sit in a bad position all day , hunched over a laptop , and the muscles get overstretched and microtears develop .\nThen the muscle starts to cramp because of this injury , and we get pain , \u201d Fischer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just an achy back .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c as dangerous for your health as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day , \u201d Dr. Nicholas DiNubile , an orthopedic surgeon at Premier Orthopedics And Sports Medicine in Pennsylvania and American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons spokesperson , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c We already have a big problem in our nation with this , and the pandemic only made it worse.\n\u201d Add inactivity with a lack of vitamin D and you have a \u201c real issue , \u201d DiNubile said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone health , but also muscle injuries , and tears are more common when levels are low.\n\u201d Kids , for example , are getting more injuries now that they \u2019 re returning to physical activities after about two years of home confinement .\n\u201c Never in my entire career have I gone two weeks without seeing an ACL injury , \u201d DiNubile said , yet at the beginning of the pandemic , about five months passed with no injured kid in sight .\n\u201c Now it \u2019 s payback .\nThey \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being sedentary could lead to loss of muscle , too , which could slow metabolism and contribute to weight gain and obesity , he added .\nAnd over two-plus years , osteoporosis , or bone thinning , could become an issue , which is particularly worrisome for white and Asian women , postmenopausal women , and teenagers ( given bone health is built in teen years ) , DiNubile said .\nThat \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important to make sure your home is equipped to support your body as best as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ergonomically appropriate equipment , like a monitor , adjustable office chair , keyboard , computer mouse , and proper back support .\nYou should set your monitor at eye level , keyboard at lap level , and both knees at a 90-degree angle , Fischer suggests , and incorporate standing breaks , short walks , and stretching into your daily routine to prevent future pain .\nSeating arrangements without cushions and solid back support will allow your body to slouch and form a \u201c C \u201d curve , said Fischer , who \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dining chair instead ( you can buy lumbar support pillows that fit any chair ) , and only use your bed for sleeping , she said .\n\u201c Mattresses are not designed for us to sit and do work on them.\n\u201d Our brains are incredibly adaptive , constantly adjusting to their surroundings .\nBut for some , shifting workplaces and social situations can have some surprising and unexpected impacts on daily life .\nJohn Redding , 46 , of Texas , said his inability to focus even for short periods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor nuisance to a major issue , \u201d even with the help of medication .\n\u201c I used to be a voracious reader , but I have n't read an entire book since the pandemic started.\n\u201d Sam Ling , an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University , told BuzzFeed News some people may be less productive at home because there are more distractions there .\nHowever , that \u2019 s not the case for everyone .\nSereena Millward , 28 , told us she struggles to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office again .\n\u201c The sounds of people talking and eating at their desk grate on me , but I also can \u2019 t concentrate if it \u2019 s deadly silent.\n\u201d ( This feeling is called misophonia . )\nThat \u2019 s because a shift in how people interact from in person to online \u2014 and then back again \u2014 can be a bit of adjustment .\n\u201c There \u2019 s exhaustion that \u2019 s involved in monitoring social cues when there \u2019 s so little information available , \u201d Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimuli overload when we return to face-to-face interactions that may be overwhelming for some .\nLing noted that retraining our brains to socialize as we used to could take some time .\nThe brain is a muscle ; the parts we don \u2019 t exercise regularly will get a little wonky .\n\u201c COVID has promoted this hermitlike life , \u201d he said , although he doesn \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve permanently rewired our \u201c pretty plastic \u201d brains to solely tolerate the comfort of our homes .\n\u201c On so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest experiments that has ever been done on the human brain.\n\u201d Pandemic home life has been a blessing in disguise for some people .\nIt helped Abby Adesanya , 29 , experience a specific ( and pleasurable ) bodily sensation for the first time in April 2020 as she was listening to Dua Lipa \u2019 s Future Nostalgia album alone in her New York apartment .\n\u201c I was blasting the album , throwing my hands in the air , wishing I could be dancing in the clubs to this .\nThen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders start to vibrate , and it spread down my arms.\n\u201d Adesanya was experiencing frisson : the chills and goosebumps often felt after listening to music or watching something in synchrony .\nAnywhere between 55 % to 86 % of people experience frisson , yet Adesanya had never felt it .\n\u201c I can not believe my body suddenly just unlocked this ability .\nI do n't know if it was trying to fill in the blanks for missing stimuli .\nBut the fact it 's here is so cool , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really dark time.\n\u201d Ling said he isn \u2019 t surprised by Adesanya \u2019 s breakthrough .\nIt \u2019 s possible when going from a hyperstimulated environment such as life in New York City to a quiet apartment that the reduction in stimuli helped unbusy her mind .\nIt \u2019 s what meditation does for many people , he said .\nAnother body part that might have suffered during the pandemic is your teeth .\nThe cost and need for insurance normally prevents many people from going to the dentist , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dental work , added another barrier to routine checkups .\nKelly Holst , an assistant professor at Temple University \u2019 s Kornberg School of Dentistry in Pennsylvania , told BuzzFeed News this worsened dental problems for many people .\n\u201c There 's only so much you can do at home .\nYou can \u2019 t scrape off the plaque , food debris , and bacteria that harden and calcify on your teeth \u201d without a dentists \u2019 help , said Holst , who also noticed an uptick in patients with preexisting dental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse boat.\n\u201d Pandemic-related stress and missed appointments have left some people with jaw pain associated with teeth grinding , too , she added .\nExtra time at home also means more , often unnecessary , snacking , which is \u201c notoriously bad for your oral health \u201d and clears the way for cavities to form , Holst said .\n\u201c At work , you 're sort of more regimented with your food intake .\nAt home , you kind of have that freedom to graze.\n\u201d Certain acidic foods and drinks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sports drinks , soda , and alcohol ) can contribute to demineralization in your enamel \u2014 the outer layer of your teeth and strongest tissue in your body \u2014 and make your mouth more acidic by throwing off your oral pH level , Holst said .\nDon \u2019 t want to put down the snacks ?\nHolst suggests you eat or drink them right away and avoid nibbling or sipping throughout the day .\nThat way you give your mouth time to naturally recalibrate itself .\nOtherwise , use fluoride toothpaste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine cleanings , and use an electric toothbrush , she said .\nSeveral people we spoke to said their body size experienced the most change during the pandemic .\nSome people lost weight , others gained .\nPatr\u00edcia Romano , 26 , used to struggle to gain weight ( she blames genetics and stress ) , but when her job became remote in 2020 , she stopped walking to and from work and gained 11 pounds .\nInstead of skipping lunch and dinner on the regular , she started eating more homemade meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to .\nBut the weight gain was rough for Romano , who \u2019 s a lawyer in Brazil .\nShe became obsessed with analyzing her body in the mirror and noticing flaws that many others likely couldn \u2019 t notice .\nIt got so bad that Romano took regular pregnancy tests because she would \u201c see a huge stomach , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c Now that some time has passed , it does n't bother me as much anymore , \u201d Romano said .\n\u201c I gave up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing it as this new body that has endured the delicate time of a worldwide stressful situation.\n\u201d Heidi ( who didn \u2019 t feel comfortable sharing her last name ) told us she got so tired of cooking for herself at home that she \u201c ended up eating less and losing a bunch of weight , which triggered some weird fatigue issues that were made worse with pandemic burnout and work-from-home/isolation.\n\u201d In general , you shouldn \u2019 t feel bad about weight changes during the pandemic .\nWe \u2019 ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nOne part of your body may have been particularly sensitive to all the changes related to your diet , mental health , and activity levels during the pandemic \u2014 your gastrointestinal tract .\nDr. Sarah McGill , an associate professor of medicine specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , told BuzzFeed News many patients say added stress and loneliness during the pandemic has led to an increase in abdominal pain , diarrhea , and nausea .\n\u201c The GI tract has even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we feel can cause GI distress , \u201d McGill said .\nWhat \u2019 s more , people increased their drinking during the pandemic , which isn \u2019 t a positive trend given alcohol is directly toxic to your GI tract , can cause fat to accumulate in your liver , and contribute to liver damage , McGill said .\nA Johns Hopkins survey of 832 adults over 21 found 60 % reported increased drinking in May 2020 compared to pre-COVID times and 34 % reported binge drinking .\nStress , alcohol availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers for increased drinking .\nFor Beth Boardman , 61 , a writer and retired nurse in California , regular afternoon wine on an empty stomach led her to develop acute gastritis and esophagitis , or inflammation of the lining of the stomach and esophagus .\nMcGill said you should avoid alcohol as much as you can , and exercise regularly , which will keep your bowel movements flowing as they should , help you maintain a stable weight , and keep your heart

have seen an improvement from an increased ability to listen to body cues \u2014 and easier access to a bathroom .\nHolding back bowel movements \u2014 for example , because you \u2019 re commuting or working in a busy office \u2014 can make constipation more likely , McGill said .\nSo , it \u2019 s safe to say spending more time at home may have made going to the bathroom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced diet consisting of fruits , vegetables , and fiber-rich whole grains is important to keep things running smoothly , whether you are spending time at home or more time out of the house .\n\u201c Fiber directly contributes to gut health by feeding the trillions of microorganisms we have there , which in turn help us with our mood , metabolism , and lots of other aspects of health , \u201d McGill said .",

        "content": "Last month I had strep throat\u2013level pain while living with two people who were confirmed COVID positive .\nYet , several rapid tests kept telling me I was COVID-free .\nIt \u2019 s a confusing experience shared by many as the highly transmissible Omicron variant continues to spread in the US .\nAt the same time , millions more at-home rapid tests are becoming available .\n( And by available , I mean there are more of them , but you can \u2019 t always find them at your local store .\nYou can order free rapid tests from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still the gold standard , they can take a few days to a week or more to produce results as understaffed labs struggle to keep up with demand .\nRapid tests are a welcome addition because they can give results in minutes .\nBut beware of the dreaded false negative .\nIt happened to Georgia resident and economist Christopher Cunningham , 46 , whose 16-year-old daughter had a positive result on a PCR test on Jan. 7 and again 10 days later .\nHer rapid tests , however , always came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 9-year-old daughter .\n( Both were vaccinated . )\nBut just because your rapid test takes a while to turn positive \u2060\u2014 or doesn \u2019 t at all \u2060\u2014 it doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re free of infection or that your test is a fraud .\nIt could happen because you were vaccinated , you missed the window when it would \u2019 ve turned positive , you collected your test sample incorrectly , or you need to test again in a few days , according to Dr. Emily Landon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine .\n( Keep in mind your symptoms could have a non-COVID cause , too \u2014 the flu is circulating . )\nHere \u2019 s how rapid tests work and why you can get false negative results when you have COVID , particularly in the early stages of infection .\nRapid COVID tests , also called antigen tests , work by detecting bits of proteins on the surface of the coronavirus .\nThey only appear positive when your body has a certain amount of virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not detect COVID cases that don \u2019 t reach that threshold .\nAnd most importantly , Landon noted , rapid tests can be negative early in your infection even if you \u2019 re feeling symptoms because it may take a while before there \u2019 s enough virus for the test to pick up .\n( Your vaccination status can influence this process , too , but more on that later . )\nThis relatively high threshold correlates with contagiousness , experts say .\nIf your rapid test is positive , you \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , Landon said .\nIf it \u2019 s negative later on in the course of your infection , after symptoms resolve , you \u2019 re likely no longer infectious .\n\u201c Rapid tests are definitely not like a pregnancy test where it 's going to be positive as long as it 's been a few weeks after someone missed a period , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It 's only going to pick it up when you 're at peak infectiousness , and they \u2019 re almost never false positive.\n\u201d In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm a positive rapid test result with a PCR test , Landon added .\n( The FDA and CDC agree . )\n\u201c Rapid tests are really reliable , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c You do n't need to swear at the company and say , \u2018 There 's no way I could have COVID \u2019 ; you definitely have COVID .\nYou need to stay home.\n\u201d There \u2019 s a relatively small window when a rapid test will be positive You can think of your viral load like a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of medicine and pathology and laboratory medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School .\n\u201c It kind of goes up sharply to a peak and then it starts to decline eventually down to zero.\n\u201d However , the window of peak viral load when rapid tests will appear positive can be relatively short , Landon said , and some people are going to miss it entirely , which could explain my and many others \u2019 experience .\nThe window varies widely , too ; it could last three days , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for some people because everyone clears the virus from their system at their own pace , she said .\nIn what seems like another layer of complexity , the intensity of that second line on your rapid test is likely an indicator of infectiousness , experts say .\nThe darker it is ( and the quicker it appears within the 15-minute wait period ) , the higher your viral load and risk of spreading the virus , and vice versa .\nYou should take more than one rapid test If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid test , Landon suggests you confirm that result with a PCR test or take another rapid within the next two days .\nWhile rapid tests are specific and are unlikely to generate a false positive , they aren \u2019 t that sensitive , meaning they are more likely to generate a false negative than some other tests .\nOn the other hand , PCR tests are much more sensitive .\nThey look for the tiniest fragments of coronavirus genetic material by multiplying the virus over a million times until it becomes detectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means PCR tests could be positive even though you \u2019 re no longer contagious because they can pick up on really low viral loads .\nThese tiny viral remains could also be zombies : pieces of dead virus that can \u2019 t make you or others sick .\nThe takeaway : Don \u2019 t be surprised if your PCR test stays positive for weeks or months after initial infection .\nIt \u2019 s normal and common .\nThe CDC says you can end isolation after five days if you have not had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are resolving .\nAfter that , they suggest caution for an additional five days , including mask-wearing , avoiding travel , and staying away from people who are at high risk .\nYou do n't need to have a negative result to end isolation , but if you do want to take a rapid antigen test , they suggest testing near the end of the five-day period when you have been fever-free for 24 hours ( without taking fever-reducing medicine ) .\nIf it 's still positive , you should isolate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important things you should remember about rapid COVID tests is that they aren \u2019 t influenced by symptoms \u2014 they only turn positive if your nasal swab has enough virus it can detect .\nWhile logically you might think more virus equals more symptoms , that \u2019 s not always the case .\nYour runny nose and muscle aches are just your body \u2019 s reactions to it fighting the coronavirus off , and that reaction varies depending on if you \u2019 ve encountered the germ before , either from an infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after symptoms appear for your body to produce a viral load that \u2019 s to the rapid test \u2019 s liking .\nHaving symptoms can be a bonus , however , because they can help you decide when to take your rapid test to ensure you get the most accurate results possible .\n\u201c People who are asymptomatic pretty much have the same rise and fall in viral load as people who are symptomatic , \u201d Blaser said .\n\u201c So , you do n't really know where you are in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic , you can still spread the coronavirus even if you \u2019 re symptom-free .\nThis means rapid tests are also helpful tools for asymptomatic people , though it \u2019 s harder to tell when to take a test without symptoms to guide you , Landon said .\nMoreover , time isn \u2019 t on your side , Landon admitted .\nRapid test results can change quickly as your viral load rises and drops , often within hours , so if you don \u2019 t have COVID symptoms , taking a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is much better than using it the day or morning before because in 12 hours that test could read positive.\n\u201d It \u2019 s unclear how viral load differs between symptomatic and asymptomatic people infected with the Omicron variant , but many early studies found it was comparable among the groups .",

        "content": "A nonsurgical N95 respirator is a mask designed to fit snugly around your nose and mouth with straps that go around your head ; it \u2019 s made of layered polypropylene , or plastic , fibers that effectively filter out 95 % of any bacteria or virus particles you or others breathe , cough , or sneeze out \u2014 if worn properly and consistently .\nThe material uses the power of static electricity to catch incoming germs or particles as air passes through the tiny spaces between the fibers .\nN95s are called \u201c respirators \u201d because they filter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like surgical masks , aren \u2019 t \u201c respirators \u201d because they can \u2019 t effectively filter the air you breathe ; they mostly help block large respiratory droplets that may carry germs from entering your mouth , like a snotty sneeze or phlegmy cough .\nThere are several different types and shapes of N95s ; some look like duck bills , others like domes , and several have three panels .\nThe main difference between nonsurgical and surgical N95s is that the latter are also fluid resistant to protect doctors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprays , Dr. David Banach , an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at UConn Health of the University of Connecticut , told BuzzFeed News .\nThe government is sending nonsurgical N95 respirators to the public because those are the masks that are available in the Strategic National Stockpile , the HHS spokesperson told us .\nBut there are similarly effective respirators , such as KN95s commonly sold at stores like Home Depot , that you could use as well .\nN95 respirators are regulated by the US with standards set by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIOSH ) , while KN95s ( and KF94s and others ) follow international standards , meaning they also should screen out about 95 % of germs and particles , but their effectiveness can vary between brands sold in the US .\nThat \u2019 s why Banach advises extra caution if you choose to wear these masks .\nThe CDC found that about 60 % of KN95s tested in 2020 and 2021 were less effective than advertised .\nThat said , many of the KN95s had a filter efficiency of 90 % or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtration efficiencies as low as 10 % to 20 % .\nBoth KN95s and KF94s offer the virus-catching electrostatic charge , so they should offer strong protection for you and others around you .\nLegitimate N95s are approved by the CDC \u2019 s NIOSH and will have specific markings , including the NIOSH logo or block letters on them to indicate their authenticity .\nKeep in mind that KN95s are not approved by NIOSH , so any claims to that effect suggests they are counterfeits .\nOther signs of counterfeit N95 respirators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes around your head , no markings on the filtering facepiece , and a missing or misspelled NIOSH mark .\nHere are some pictures of counterfeit respirators from the CDC and a full list of companies that make NIOSH-approved face respirators that are similarly or more protective than N95s .\nThe biggest complaint people make about N95s is that they can be hard to wear , particularly in hot conditions or when you have to exert yourself .\n( N95s with exhalation valves can help improve breathability , but experts strongly recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t filter the air you exhale \u2014 so they protect you , but not the people around you if you have COVID . )\nAlthough it may take a bit more effort to breathe through N95s , NIOSH tests have shown some of the respirators have better overall breathability than cloth or surgical masks , Karan of Stanford said , so it could take some time before you find the right type for you .\nOn the more comfortable side are the loose-fitting and disposable surgical masks , which can offer high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly ( secured over your mouth , nose , and chin with minimal gaps ) .\nThey are made of the same electrostatic material as N95s , but surgical masks don \u2019 t have the same fit or filters as their higher-quality counterparts .\nCloth masks could be anything from a scrap of T-shirt attached to two ear loops to a bandana .\nThe CDC and other experts say these options offer the least protection against the coronavirus , though there are ways to lock in more protection , like layering it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N95 \u2019 s protection compare to other masks ?\nIn its updated guidance , the CDC says well-fitting N95 respirators give the best protection for yourself and others , followed by KN95s and surgical masks , then cloth masks .\nN95s and KN95s are about 90\u201395 % or more protective against virus particles ( but remember it could vary with KN95s ) , while surgical masks stand in the 50\u201360 % range , Karan said .\nIf you layer them with a cloth mask , you can reach between 70\u201375 % protection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little as 20-40 % effective , he added .",

after hearing reports of violent attacks against Asian American people , who were being blamed for the health crisis .\nBetter to be safe , we all thought .\nBut month by month , this forced sedentary lifestyle took its toll on his older body .\nHe didn \u2019 t have COVID , but he grew weak .\nHis ability to walk diminished through the pandemic .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather left us .\nIt was Christmas Day , which on the lunar calendar was also his birthday .\nBy traditional Chinese convention , Grandpa saw the dawn of his 96th year .\nWhen he could no longer breathe on his own , the relatives who were able to rush to the hospital in Queens were allowed to visit his bedside one at a time , per the hospital \u2019 s pandemic rules , to whisper our goodbyes to him through our masks .\nHow do you say farewell when you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his resemblance in my baby son , whom he had only met once because COVID never went away .\n\u201c Goodbye , gong gong , \u201d I said .\n\u201c Thank you.\n\u201d My grandfather was buried beside my grandmother \u2019 s grave in a Brooklyn cemetery on a foggy day , surrounded by his family \u2014 just not me .\nFor two years I had managed to dodge COVID , but it had finally caught up with me on this of all days .\nIt happened at 6 a.m. the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suddenly had a fever .\nJust a day earlier , I got a negative PCR result , clearing myself to attend the service , so I stared in disbelief as two pink lines materialized on the rapid test I was taking at my bathroom sink before the sun had even risen : positive .\nAs I breathed through alternating waves of grief and numbness over the last two years , I \u2019 ve regularly told myself , Just keep doing your part to end the pandemic .\nBut with thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we look ahead to year three , I now feel there is little more I have left to offer this cause .\nThis changing virus is hard to predict , but I can \u2019 t shake the sense that we blew our shot to make things better .\nIt was only a month ago that the White House brushed off the idea of shipping a test to every American , sending local officials around the country scrambling to open more testing sites as Omicron began its unhindered spread through schools , nursing homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 million cases , roughly a third of all confirmed cases in the US since the start of the pandemic in 2020 , have been counted since Dec. 1 , according to data compiled by the New York Times .\nThe White House finally announced in mid-January that it would buy a billion at-home rapid COVID tests , so that each \u201c residential address \u201d is entitled to one set of four tests , to be sent out at the end of the month .\nPeople can order them online ( the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chinese ) and a phone line will be open for those who don \u2019 t have internet access .\nIt \u2019 s strange how such a massive undertaking can still feel like too little , too late .\nVaccines have changed the game , protecting people from the worst outcomes , but the emotional toll of the pandemic is wearing .\nOmicron \u2019 s pervasive spread the last few weeks means new variants are almost certainly evolving , with no guarantee that they will be milder or less contagious , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , there are no good options .\nI , like so many , have lost the will to go back into the bunker because two years in , I now know that the people who have never cared about the pandemic and who refuse to take precautions will continue to spread the virus .\nAnd I now know our government will protect these freedoms over everyone \u2019 s safety ( the Supreme Court recently blocked a Biden administration rule requiring large companies to mandate that their staff be vaccinated ) .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though .\nEven vaccinated people can spread the coronavirus now .\nThe silver lining I once thought was near has faded .\n\u201c It 's just been two long years of uncertainty , and unpredictability , and having to constantly course-correct based on new information that is often incomplete , that does n't have a clear black-and-white answer to it , \u201d said psychologist Vaile Wright , the American Psychological Association \u2019 s senior director of healthcare innovation .\n\u201c We 've just reached the point where it 's starting to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it is.\n\u201d What more can I do ?\nI \u2019 ve played all my cards .\nI \u2019 ve stayed home for most of the last 22 months .\nI have abstained from simple things that once gave me so much pleasure : cozy Manhattan restaurants , outsize gatherings of friends and family , movie theaters throbbing with energy on opening weekends .\nI \u2019 ve dutifully worn my mask as required .\nI \u2019 ve navigated changing rules at daycares and schools , and the disruptions of keeping my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illness or a case is reported in the classroom .\nI got vaccinated as soon as I could .\nI \u2019 ve been trying to protect not only myself but also my kids , who are still too young to protect themselves .\nNone of this is unique ; millions of Americans share this reality .\nBut the incredible scale of this wave made me lose any sense of control .\nStuck at home the day of my grandfather \u2019 s funeral , I threw my rapid test in the trash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our discipline , and our caution , and our sacrifices through the pandemic now seemed futile ; the inevitability of having to breathe the same air as the people around us meant we couldn \u2019 t prevent the virus \u2019 s spread .\nI knew I was still luckier than many people who had the virus , or who had lost loved ones to it , but these cold assurances brought me little comfort that day .\nI replayed the last few days in my mind , ruminating on how I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been even more diligent so I could have stayed well and been at the funeral with them .\nBut I was defeated .\nThe pandemic had taken so much from us .\nCOVID hospitalizations and deaths have continued to rise since my grandfather died , but I have nothing left to give to help end this pandemic .\nPerhaps we just move forward with the uncomfortable reality that \u201c just about everybody \u201d will catch the virus , according to the White House \u2019 s chief medical adviser , Anthony Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unvaccinated in particular , will not survive .\nThe truth is , \u201c a lot of things are out of our control , \u201d Wright said .\nAt this point , people could benefit from a shift in mindset that includes a level of acceptance \u2014 not necessarily approval \u2014 that this is just how life is going to be .\nThere is no right way to deal with the pandemic now , she said .\nLike most other vaccinated people who tested positive , I found my symptoms were mild .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a local pharmacy , came with no instructions about what to do if you test positive , or who to inform .\nI had previously called my state health department to self-report a case but didn \u2019 t get through .\nOfficial counts don \u2019 t include cases like mine ; we are the invisible wave .\nOne billion tests are soon going to be conducted from home , their results unreported and unknown .\nIt seems as if our leaders , caught completely unprepared by this wave , are increasingly leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get to the other side .\nFor the vaccinated , the stakes are different now .\nSerious disease is unlikely , and it seems we \u2019 re moving away from a state of emergency .\nSchools are open , business goes on , and quarantine periods are now down from 10 days to five .\nBut the virus is still here , and we each have to reckon with it and make wrenching decisions on our own , every day .\nWe move forward by putting one foot in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t know where we \u2019 re headed .\nI thought \u201c getting better \u201d would feel better than this .\nWhen my isolation period ended , I left my room and gave my children the tightest hugs .\nI pressed them into me , pushed their fleshy cheeks against mine .\nI had missed them more than I could imagine .\nIt had only been days , but they somehow seemed bigger .\nI wished I had answers ; all parents do .\nI held them and thought , For however long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight \u2014 we are in it together .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "During the past two years of the pandemic , there have been some profound racial and ethnic disparities , with some communities of color having COVID hospitalization and mortality rates more than double that of other groups of people .\nNow , a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report suggests there are inequities in the use of lifesaving COVID treatments , with some people less likely than others to get early treatment with monoclonal antibodies , which has been shown to prevent hospitalizations and deaths .\nThe analysis found that people who are Hispanic faced the most barriers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies 58 % less often than their non-Hispanic peers .\nPatients who were Asian , as well as those who identified with the \u201c other \u201d category , including Native American , Alaska Native , Native Hawaiian , and multiracial patients , received monoclonal antibodies about 48 % and 47 % less often , respectively , than white patients .\nBlack patients were treated with the protective proteins 22 % less often .\nThe research team , led by Jennifer Wiltz and Amy Feehan , looked at electronic records for COVID treatments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41 US healthcare systems between November 2020 and August 2021 .\nAbout 11 % were treated in a hospital , where the differences in use among racial and ethnic groups were less pronounced .\nThe treatments included monoclonal antibodies , the antiviral medication remdesivir , and the steroid dexamethasone , which is used to fight inflammation .\nSome are used early on in an infection and can help prevent COVID hospitalization , like monoclonal antibodies .\nOthers , like steroids , are used later in serious cases to battle out-of-control immune reactions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 4 % or less for all racial and ethnic groups , according to the report released Jan. 14 .\nMonoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins infused or injected into patients , typically in health clinics or doctor \u2019 s offices within 10 days of symptoms .\nOverall , average monthly use of monoclonal antibodies was low : 4 % in white patients , 2.8 % in Black patients , 2.2 % in patients who were Asian or another race , and 1.8 % in Hispanic patients .\nOnce hospitalized , there seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dexamethasone , and patients who were Black received remdesivir about 9 % more often than others .\nThe researchers said the disparities they uncovered with monoclonal antibodies may not reflect those in the real world because they were restricted to patients who received COVID treatments through a healthcare system ; monoclonal antibodies can be given to patients in government-run infusion sites that likely go unrecorded .\nThe researchers also didn \u2019 t analyze the reason for the disparities , but they speculate that a number of systemic factors are likely to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , insufficient health insurance , potential bias among medical professionals or a lack of a primary care doctor to recommend the treatments , and language barriers , which can leave people unaware of therapies and vulnerable to severe yet preventable COVID outcomes .\nThese factors also make it more likely people of color will develop medical conditions that raise their chances of severe COVID , the CDC says , contributing to disproportionate coronavirus infection , hospitalization , and death rates among racial and ethnic groups .\n\u201c I just want to emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , \u201d Dr. Utibe Essien , an assistant professor of medicine and health disparities researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c This is not a new issue .\nThere are so many tiers and levers that we can all be pulling to address this , going all the way from when these drugs are developed to who is present in the studies that test these drugs to how easy is it for patients to access medications at a doctor or pharmacy.\n\u201d There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse \u201d these disparities , Dr. Amesh Adalja , an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security , told BuzzFeed News .\nMobile clinics that bring monoclonal antibody treatments to patients and telemedicine visits that make it easier to see a doctor can help spread awareness and access to treatments for high-risk patients .\nOne recent study found telemedicine visits helped increase attendance at follow-up doctor \u2019 s appointments after hospitalization from 52 % to 70 % among Black patients .\nThe study included patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason from January 2019 to June 2020 .\nIn contrast , follow-up care among white patients dropped slightly , from 68 % to 67 % in the same period .\nCOVID treatment guidelines don \u2019 t always take into account race and ethnicity Although the CDC study looked at patients treated before the Omicron and Delta surges , some states like North Carolina , Texas , and Mississippi are still struggling with COVID treatment shortages , leading doctors to prioritize therapies for the highest-risk patients .\nNational health officials often recommend COVID treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own recommendations , meaning guidance and access to COVID therapies may differ depending on where you live .\nThe FDA , for example , includes race and ethnicity as a potential risk factor for severe COVID in its medication fact sheets for healthcare providers .\nAn FDA spokesperson told BuzzFeed News it \u2019 s up to doctors to \u201c consider the benefit-risk for an individual patient \u201d when determining access to therapies .\nSome states like New York and Utah have adopted that language , stating doctors should consider race and ethnicity when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID .",

using your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and sticking to set bedtimes and wake times .\nShelby Harris , a clinical psychologist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine , also notes that if you tend to bury your head under the covers or can \u2019 t resist repeated snooze sessions , this type of alarm clock may not be the right choice .\nIt all depends on your ideal sleep environment and where your sleeping or waking issues are stemming from .\nIf you tend to struggle to get out of bed when you \u2019 re forced to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you experience season-related mood changes in general , you may have seasonal affective disorder .\nWhile anyone can have the \u201c winter blues , \u201d about 5 % of people have seasonal affective disorder , otherwise known as SAD or seasonal depression , according to the American Psychiatric Association .\nSAD is a type of depression that \u2019 s most common in fall and winter months , when there are fewer hours of sunlight per day , although it can occur in summer in some people .\nPeople who have SAD experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and it \u2019 s more common in women than men .\nOne common treatment is light therapy , which often comes in the form of a specific type of lamp .\n\u201c Light has a physiological direct impact on our mood , \u201d which is why light therapy helps with seasonal depression , Robbins explained .\nSince many of these sunrise alarm clocks have adjustable brightness settings , it makes sense that they could also help with some symptoms of SAD .\nThat said , light therapy for SAD treatment usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to a lightbox with a brightness of 10,000 lux each morning or a lightbox with a brightness of 2,500 lux for one to two hours .\nSunrise alarm clocks tend to have a lux that \u2019 s 300 or lower .\nWhile gradual light from an alarm clock might help improve your mood and ability to wake up , follow your healthcare provider \u2019 s guidance for any light-related treatments if you \u2019 ve been diagnosed with SAD .\nWhen Dr. Dasgupta thinks about alarm clocks or any other device that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , he thinks of one patient population in particular \u2014 those with insomnia .\nWhile almost everyone experiences an inability to sleep at some point , he \u2019 s referring to those with chronic insomnia , which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines as having symptoms more than three times per week for up to three months .\nInsomnia generally involves difficulty initiating sleep and maintaining sleep throughout the night .\nWhile he emphasizes that the mainstay therapy for these issues is cognitive behavioral therapy , sunrise alarm clocks are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c You have to have all the right pieces to complete that puzzle to get that good sleep , \u201d he said .\n\u201c When people try different things to get good sleep , it really depends on what puzzle piece is missing.\n\u201d For some , that missing piece may be the comfort of a weighted blanket .\nFor others , a white noise machine may do the trick .\nBut if you \u2019 re sensitive to light and creating faux dawn sounds like a nicer way to wake than jarring beeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth trying out one of the clocks on this list .",

        "content": "As we head into year three of the COVID-19 pandemic , the updates and recommendations for how to stay safe from COVID , particularly for children , seem to be evolving as fast as a new variant in an unvaccinated population .\n( Sorry , pandemic humor . )\nIn all seriousness , as Omicron surges , the new guidance for children \u2019 s vaccines , boosters , masking , and school safety are moving so quickly that it \u2019 s hard for parents and caregivers to keep up .\nThe result is often pandemic-related confusion : Are cloth masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids to return to school based on symptoms and testing ?\nIs COVID really as bad as or worse than familiar childhood ailments like the flu and RSV ?\nAnd , most importantly , do parents really need to test a child for COVID every time they get a sniffle ?\nIf you \u2019 re sick of asking people in the group chat or on the playground ( and getting very strong and likely incorrect opinions ) , we asked some real experts for the answers to common questions .\nHere \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the COVID symptoms in children ?\nChildren generally have symptoms just like adults , including a cough , fever , a runny nose , and sore throat .\nThe latest development is that kids with COVID can often have croup , which causes a distinctive cough , hoarseness , and labored breathing .\n\u201c For many of the young kids I have been seeing , they present with croup , \u201d said Dr. Jennifer Shu , an Atlanta-based pediatrician .\nSometimes the only symptoms in babies are fussiness and increased crying because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c The baby may be crying and you can \u2019 t pinpoint a reason for it , \u201d she said .\nChildren also get a loss of taste and smell , just like adults , but they may have more trouble articulating that than an adult would , said Dr. Dean Blumberg , chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children \u2019 s Hospital .\nIn general , kids tend to have a less severe illness than adults .\nUnfortunately , hospitalizations are on the rise for children , including babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn fact , hospitalizations are at the highest point since the start of the pandemic , according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky .\nMy kid always has a runny nose , especially in winter .\nDo I need to get them tested every time they \u2019 re stuffed up ?\nTesting every kid for COVID every day is \u201c just not practical , \u201d said George Rutherford , a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of California , San Francisco .\nHe doesn \u2019 t think children need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an exposure or symptoms of \u201c more severe upper respiratory infections.\n\u201d Blumberg agreed and said when it comes to testing kids , it 's more important to focus on new symptoms ; a child might have a runny nose due to allergies or something else .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t think there is anything out of the ordinary with your child , then you don \u2019 t have to test because of symptoms such as a runny nose , \u201d he said .\nHowever , Shu recommends that given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s a good idea to err on the side of caution and test children .\n\u201c We are seeing so much COVID compared to other cold viruses , even higher than flu in my area , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The vast majority of viruses I \u2019 m seeing are COVID.\n\u201d She added , \u201c There \u2019 s a ton .\nCOVID can look like any other respiratory illness.\n\u201d How accurate are rapid tests for young children under the age of 5 ?\nRutherford said there doesn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they perform for children versus adults .\nRapid tests should work even when used in babies , experts told us .\nThat said , false negatives are common in rapid COVID tests early in an infection .\nYou may need to retest after a negative result , particularly if a child has respiratory symptoms .\n\u201c The timing can be tricky , \u201d Shu said .\n\u201c If you don \u2019 t catch it on the right day where there \u2019 s enough virus to trigger that test to turn positive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false negative.\n\u201d A positive result on a rapid antigen test is much more reliable in general ( meaning if the result is positive , your child almost certainly has COVID if they also have symptoms ) , although following up with a PCR test to confirm is recommended .\nHow strong is the evidence that kids in preschool or at any age should be wearing masks ?\nThe evidence for masking in preschool \u201c is strong , \u201d Rutherford said , as long as the child is over 2 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for younger children .\nThe data doesn \u2019 t come directly from preschools , but Rutherford said there \u2019 s \u201c really good \u201d evidence for the effectiveness of masks in elementary schools , and there \u2019 s no reason to think preschools would be different .\nBlumberg said surgical masks provide 60 % \u201370 % protection , and he prefers those over cloth masks , which are less standardized .\n( Any mask is better than no mask . )\nWhen Shu is choosing a surgical mask , she looks for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is three- or four-ply , which tends to offer the best protection .\nYour child can use a medical mask and a cloth mask over it to be extra safe , or they can wear a KN95 or N95 mask if they can tolerate it .\nWhile N95s come in smaller sizes and can be worn by children , they can be harder to breathe though , and it \u2019 s important to find a mask that fits well and that a child will actually wear .\n\u201c If they aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t wear it at all , \u201d Blumberg said .\nParents of children who are immunocompromised may prefer the greater protection that comes with an N95 ; some people , he added , buy several kinds to find one their child is comfortable with .\nKids often adapt to mask-wearing ( and wearing them correctly ) better than adults , he said .\nLetting kids choose and decorate masks can increase the chances that they will wear them .\nChildren may also play with the masks , get them wet by biting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them more quickly than you \u2019 d think , Shu said , so it \u2019 s important to swap them out as necessary .\nSome schools or preschools let kids come in with a negative rapid test , even when they have minor cold symptoms .\nOthers require no symptoms for 24 hours and a negative PCR .\nWhich policy makes more sense ?\n\u201c You do n't want colds passed around schools either , right ?\n\u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c But on the other hand , one of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go work .\nThat 's a benefit of it .\nAnd if you send them home every time they sneeze , you 're going to have a lot of unhappy parents.\n\u201d Rutherford said it makes sense for schools to continue to follow whatever pre-COVID sickness policies they had in place , with an added layer of COVID testing for children with more severe upper respiratory symptoms .\nBut he said this testing should be rapid , not PCR , which usually takes multiple days to deliver results .\nBlumberg said it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer that children who are having symptoms , like coughing , stay home until they are better .\n\u201c Schools may be extra sensitive to respiratory symptoms , even in a setting of a negative test , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c It just makes everyone uncomfortable to be around somebody who is coughing or sneezing in the age of COVID.\n\u201d Shu recommends sticking to CDC guidelines if a child does test positive for COVID .\nThe CDC recommends that kids who test positive stay out of school for 10 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults .\nThe agency recently shortened the isolation period to five days for adults who are asymptomatic , followed by five more days of mask-wearing .\nIt \u2019 s a different story for kids , who are at school all day and have to take their masks off to eat lunch , exercise in gym class , and for other reasons .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not like they can continue to stay masked for the second five days of that 10-day isolation , \u201d Shu said .\nHow long does COVID last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms in children can range from very mild or nonexistent to more severe , such as a high fever or chest pain , which may necessitate a hospital visit for oxygen , depending on other risk factors and whether they are vaccinated .\nThe symptoms can last as little as one day , Shu said , but usually it \u2019 s about a week or sometimes even longer .\n\u201c A lot of my patients are having a cough linger for three to four weeks , \u201d Shu said .\nHow worried should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long COVID ?\nMore research still needs to be done to determine how often children \u2014 especially the youngest ones \u2014 get long COVID , which can make people sick for months .\nLong COVID , which can include memory and sleep problems , fatigue , and shortness of breath , is more common in adults than children .\nAnd it \u2019 s more common in older children and teens than younger kids .\nAbout 20 % \u201340 % of teens who get infected may develop long COVID , said Blumberg .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , but we don \u2019 t have good numbers on that.\n\u201d However , the symptoms are similar in children and can include fatigue and difficulty sleeping .\n\u201c Older children will describe fuzzy thinking , that they are just not able to think clearly or they might have memory issues , \u201d Blumberg said .\n\u201c Those are the kind of long COVID symptoms we have been seeing in children.\n\u201d Shu has an 11-year-old patient who got COVID early in the pandemic and lost his sense of smell and taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be able to be as active in sports as in the past because of chest pain , breathing problems , and shortness of breath , she said .\nWhere does COVID-19 fall on the scale of severity for childhood diseases ?\nIs it more or less serious than the flu or RSV ?\nAbout 100 to 150 children die each year in the US from the flu , and 100 to 500 from the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .\nIn comparison , more than 800 children have died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pandemic .\nAbout 7.9 million children in the US , or more than 1 in 10 , have tested positive for COVID .\nIn 2020 , COVID was the seventh-leading cause of death in children in the US .\n\u201c So it \u2019 s worse than RSV and worse than influenza , \u201d Blumberg said .\nPart of the reason the mortality rate is so high with COVID is that no one in the population had any immunity to this new virus .\nAs more children get vaccinated for COVID ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are exposed to the virus , hopefully , fewer children will get severely sick and die , he said .\n\u201c Getting vaccinated is the safest thing for children , \u201d he said .\nIs the COVID vaccine safe for kids ?\nYes , it \u2019 s considered very safe .\nNo children have died due to vaccination , unlike COVID , which , as we said , is potentially life-threatening .\nMore than 9 billion doses of vaccine have been given worldwide , so there \u2019 s a \u201c proven track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about 23 % of children 5 to 11 have been fully vaccinated , and about 62 % of children 12 to 17 .\nThe vaccine is now approved for children 5 and older , and kids 12 and older can get vaccinated and a booster .\n\u201c I am disappointed that the numbers are so low , \u201d she said .\nMany children who are eligible are not getting vaccinated .\n\u201c Any loss of a child \u2019 s life is tragic , so why not try to avoid that ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the American Academy of Pediatrics .\n\u201c I often have people say in hindsight , 'Gosh , I wish I had gotten the vaccine . '\nI \u2019 ve never had someone say , \u2018 Gosh , I wish I hadn \u2019 t gotten the vaccine.\n\u2019 \u201d How can you best protect babies and children who are too young to get vaccinated or wear masks ?\nAs we said , masks aren \u2019 t appropriate for children under age 2 , and kids under 5 can \u2019 t get vaccinated .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mothers have been vaccinated or infected .\nVaccination is highly recommended for people who are pregnant because of the high risk of COVID complications in pregnancy as well as the ability to generate antibodies that can be passed to the fetus .\n\u201c I do n't think infants are susceptible until after 6 months of life because they get a lot of maternal antibody transplacentally and through breast milk , \u201d Rutherford said .\n\u201c Now , after 7 months , 8 , 9 months , as maternal antibodies start to wane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , but they 're not common at all.\n\u201d The best way to protect youngsters is to make sure the people around them wear masks , are vaccinated , and have had their boosters .\n\u201c Surrounding the baby with a \u2018 bubble \u2019 of people who are vaccinated is a great first step , \u201d said Dr. Danielle Zerr , head of pediatric infectious diseases at Seattle Children \u2019 s Hospital , in an email .\n\u201c In addition , depending on community transmission rates , other steps would include avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close interaction to just the important people in your life who are vaccinated , and avoiding contact with symptomatic people .\n\u201d",

        "content": "CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned on Friday that pediatric hospitals are seeing record numbers of children with COVID-19 , as the Omicron variant surges nationwide .\nUS coronavirus cases are currently higher than they \u2019 ve ever been , averaging around 600,000 new cases reported daily ( itself an undercount ) , with hospitalization rates that have increased for people of all ages , according to Walensky , who briefed reporters on Friday .\nMore than 1,200 people a day are dying of COVID-19 nationwide .\n\u201c While children still have the lowest rate of hospitalization of any group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to any prior point in the pandemic , \u201d Walensky said .\n\u201c Sadly , we are seeing the rates of hospitalization increasing for children 0 to 4 , children who are not yet currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.\n\u201d As of Jan. 1 , the rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations among children under 4 was 4.3 cases per 100,000 .\nThat \u2019 s almost four times higher than it is among kids 5 to 17 , who are eligible for vaccination , according to Walensky , and more than twice the hospitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time last year .\nShe added that CDC data does show that children above the age of 4 are more likely to be in the hospital if they are unvaccinated .\nWalensky pointed out that some unknown number of these cases are incidental \u2014 children who test positive when they are hospitalized for non-COVID reasons .\nMany of the case reports of children come from asymptomatic kids who enter the hospital for elective procedures or other illnesses , she added , complicating the picture for epidemiologists trying to figure out risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of epidemiology and pediatrics at UCSF , said these numbers show that COVID is widespread , is infecting children , and some proportion of them will be hospitalized .\n\u201c Hospitalizations are going up .\nThere 's no reason to think that they would n't go up in children , \u201d he said , adding that \u201c children do n't seem to be as unsusceptible to this as they have been to earlier strains.\n\u201d But he thinks it \u2019 s too early to say that the proportion of infected children requiring hospitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC data is mostly from the northeastern region .\nNot knowing how many of these hospital cases are incidental makes the numbers even harder to interpret .\n\u201c I 've seen in London , where they actually do publish these data , that a third of COVID hospitalizations are incidental findings , \u201d he added .\nStill , he said that COVID-19 is a serious disease for children , and protecting them while Omicron surges across the country is paramount .\n\u201c In 2020 COVID was the seventh leading cause of death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutherford said .\n\u201c It is a big deal .\nAnd people who pooh-pooh it and say 'oh , it 's no big deal ' are blind to facts.\n\u201d Masking in school and other indoor settings is helpful , he said , but what \u2019 s most important is for parents to try to ensure that everyone their child is in contact with is vaccinated and boosted ( if they are eligible ) .\nIt remains an open question whether Omicron is any more likely to lead to more severe disease in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen with Delta , Walensky said .\n\u201c We are seeing a rise in hospitalizations , both because they are coming in with COVID but also because they 're screening in for COVID , '' she said .\n`` [ We ] have not yet seen a signal that there is any increased severity in this age demographic.\n\u201d Throughout the briefing , Walensky also defended the CDC against complaints that recent changes to protocols for isolating or quarantining after an infection , down to five days without symptoms , were confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outside experts .\n\u201c This virus has changed , and it 's constantly throwing up curveballs , \u201d Walensky said in response .\nAs this virus changes , the CDC will have to change its guidance when working with state and local public health \u201c to provide recommendations that are most feasible and can be implemented in communities across the country , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The past few weeks have been challenging for all of us .\n\u201d",

        "content": "Our family and friendship circles seem torn in two : those who are afraid and still want restrictive measures and those who are resigned to living with COVID as the new reality .\nIleana Schinder , an architect in Washington , DC , was in tears as she described the stress and concern she has for her two young children who are lurching back and forth between classroom instruction and remote learning with each new outbreak in their class .\nSchinder , 45 , said she feels hollow and exhausted , as if she \u2019 s run a marathon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward one block at a time , over and over .\n\u201c I \u2019 m an architect .\nI should be able to design my way out of this mental labyrinth , but I can \u2019 t , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Can you ?\n\u201d The world looks markedly different than it did when COVID first swept and shuttered the globe .\nThere are now multiple vaccines that are safe and effective at preventing serious illness .\nMore than 4.6 billion people around the world have had at least one shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus , including how to test for it relatively cheaply and easily .\nWe have new lifesaving treatments .\n\u201c This is not March of 2020 , \u201d President Joe Biden assured a weary public just before Christmas .\n\u201c Two hundred million [ Americans ] are fully vaccinated .\nWe \u2019 re prepared .\nWe know more .\nWe just have to stay focused.\n\u201d And yet as Omicron now infects record numbers of people globally , filling up hospitals and closing businesses and classrooms , there is a lingering and strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also feels different this time .\n\u201c Earlier in the pandemic , I was actually really scared I could end up killing my mother .\nThat was a very real fear , \u201d said Allison Clough , a 50-year-old mother of two teens in the Bay Area who asked to be identified by her middle name so as not to embarrass her kids .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s very likely anymore .\nI don \u2019 t feel scared in that way , but it \u2019 s ruining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s kind of confusing.\n\u201d As regular people struggle to make sense of this point in the pandemic , experts are also wondering how we got here \u2014 and how we haven \u2019 t done a better job of preparing for it .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in a difficult time .\nWe \u2019 re in a strange time , \u201d said Georges Benjamin , executive director of the American Public Health Association .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in a time where we \u2019 ve had two years of experience with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it continues to evolve \u2026 But as it evolves , we \u2019 re still in many ways kind of chasing it.\n\u201d Arthur Caplan , medical ethics director at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine , was far more blunt and sweeping in his assessment of the current state of confusion .\n\u201c I would say we \u2019 re in a cacophonous , disorienting , deteriorating mess , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Many people have no idea what to do about something simple like masking , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c Huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete failure to provide adequate amounts of test kits .\nParents are furious they \u2019 re not getting consistent policies that should have been planned weeks ago about what happens to their kids .\nMessaging from the CDC and other government authorities has become a mishmash of confusion for many people .\nMost people I talk to don \u2019 t know what fully vaccinated means and no one seems to be helping them understand it .\nAnd the internet is awash with escalating misinformation and conspiracy content .\nIt is somewhat inevitable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix have become more complex , given both the evolving nature of affairs and the virus itself .\nEven before the Omicron variant emerged , requiring yet more study and analysis , people around the world were already trying to adapt their lives around COVID .\nWorkers were returning to offices .\nInternational borders had reopened .\nPeople were dancing in nightclubs again , albeit in many places that check vaccine cards at the door .\nWe got to celebrate Thanksgiving .\nOmicron then arrived at a time when each person \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an inflection point in public thinking .\nAfter a summer dashed by Delta , many had already begun to imagine a world where COVID would be with us for quite some time .\nThe new variant \u2019 s incredible infectiousness , and apparent relative mildness for vaccinated individuals , has only seemed to deepen a sense of inevitability for many people .\nAs comic Isabel Hagen joked , \u201c Making plans in 2022 : I can \u2019 t get covid this week , but I could next week ?\n\u201d \u201c It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s omnipresent , \u201d said American Medical Association President Gerald Harmon .\n\u201c We \u2019 re trying to adapt to that and we \u2019 re trying to avoid being overrun , not only in our day-to-day lives but in our healthcare systems.\n\u201d \u201c We want to have this in the rearview mirror and we can \u2019 t quite get there , \u201d Harmon said .\n\u201c It always seems to be alongside us in the passing lane , and every now and then it gets ahead of us.\n\u201d The AMA was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s evolving guidance on quarantine and isolation , which has seesawed on whether a negative test was necessary for asymptomatic people to reenter public life after five days .\nThe guidance has even confused US senators .\nCDC Director Rochelle Walensky , whose communication skills have come under intense scrutiny , had defended the decision by arguing the tests don \u2019 t definitively show whether someone is still infectious , but large sectors of the public have not been able to keep up with this nuance .\nWith an unmistakable sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday in which the AMA president appeared aghast at the CDC .\n\u201c Nearly two years into this pandemic , with Omicron cases surging across the country , the American people should be able to count on [ the CDC ] for timely , accurate , clear guidance to protect themselves , their loved ones , and their communities , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Instead , the new recommendations on quarantine and isolation are not only confusing , but are risking further spread of the virus.\n\u201d Harmon told BuzzFeed News his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he still has trust and confidence in the CDC , but that he felt a duty to speak out at what he saw as mixed messaging .\n\u201c When I see something that \u2019 s a little bit incongruent , it makes me a little bit uncertain , \u201d he said .\nIn defending the CDC , one prominent scientist who spoke with BuzzFeed News \u2014 but asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the questions \u2014 said they believed there is a \u201c false assumption \u201d that experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s this idea in the public that the knowledge is kind of static : \u2018 Just tell us what it is !\nWhy are you waffling around ?\n\u2019 \u201d this scientist said .\n\u201c But the knowledge is accruing day by day and it \u2019 s going to change day by day as the data changes .\nIt \u2019 s not something that can be reduced to one simple sentence because there \u2019 s all these \u2018 if not this , then that , and if not that , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I don \u2019 t think the scientists and the public health experts are confused .\nBut there is uncertainty , \u201d they said , citing the unprecedented nature of the pandemic .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a different thing , though , to not be confused and to know what \u2019 s going to happen .\nThe scientists don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going to happen , but they \u2019 re not confused about what does happen.\n\u201d For regular Americans , though , it has been somewhat hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CDC has been frustratingly unclear on defining a mask \u2019 s effect on determining close contacts , \u201d said Roger Yamada , a 38-year-old attorney in New York City .\n\u201c How do we assess cloth masks vs. surgical masks vs. KN95/KF94/N95 masks ?\nOr does it not matter at all ?\n\u201d \u201c More than anything it \u2019 s just annoying , \u201d said Daniel Golson , a 28-year-old social media editor in Los Angeles , who with his friends is navigating the maze of testing and isolation guidelines after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Year \u2019 s trip to Montana .\n\u201c I want to do the right thing to prevent me from potentially infecting others , but I also do n't want to unnecessarily spend money to have to stay in a place and not go home if I do n't need to.\n\u201d Public health officials have been clear that this Omicron wave is not like previous surges .\nTop White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci has said it was \u201c very prudent \u201d for the CDC to try to change its guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant \u2019 s transmissibility and period of infectiousness , in order to try to avoid massive staff shortages across every industry and effectively keep society running .\nFauci also said this past weekend that the US was entering a new stage of the pandemic where hospitalizations , not total caseloads , should be the focus of public attention .\nBut the prominent scientist said it was evident there was something of a fissure between experts and the public .\n\u201c The American public has become over decades science illiterate , \u201d they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different language than regular people can understand .\nIt \u2019 s kind of a mismatch between those who communicate and those who want to be communicated with not talking the same language.\n\u201d Caplan , the NYU medical ethicist , said he believed that due to this scientific illiteracy , it was natural that people have become confused , even angry , by the shifting messages .\n\u201c If you have lousy training on critical thinking and scientific methods in your high schools and junior high schools then it \u2019 s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to interpret what \u2019 s going on in a plague , \u201d he said .\nClough , the Bay Area mother , said her friendship circles seem torn in two by those who are afraid and still want restrictive measures and those who are resigned to trying to live in what they feel is their new reality .\n\u201c Some of my friends are worried school closures are going to be a drag and others are still afraid they \u2019 re gon na die , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that.\n\u201d Tensions are also high in her community , where whether or not your children will be in class can depend on a county line .\nEveryone she knows is vaccinated , including her kids and their friends , but there seems to be politics everywhere .\nShe \u2019 s noticed people again walking solo on the beach but still wearing a mask , which she thinks they \u2019 re doing as some sort of statement .\nShe said she was accused of wanting to murder teachers when she raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children becoming extremely ill or dying from COVID .\n\u201c Just looking at the numbers , the chance that even without the booster shot my 13-year-old is going to end up seriously ill is vanishingly small , \u201d she said , \u201c but it \u2019 s become so politicized in my extremely liberal community that it \u2019 s almost like some people want to hold on to the possibility of that against all this data.\n\u201d In DC , Schinder , the architect and mother , begrudgingly admitted she \u2019 s even begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looks with jealousy at photos of friends \u2019 children in Republican-led states where schools have stubbornly stayed open through most of the pandemic .\nHow is it fair , she wonders , that her city \u2019 s leaders seem to be prioritizing people \u2019 s right to go to bars over her kids being in a classroom ?\n\u201c If you \u2019 d have told me that two years down the road my kids wouldn \u2019 t be in school , I \u2019 d have thought that we didn \u2019 t yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut we \u2019 ve moved on from that .\nWe have a health solution , \u201d Schinder said .\n\u201c What pains me is we \u2019 re still adapting every decision to those that effectively decide to ride bicycles without a helmet , to those that ride in cars without seatbelts .\nI think it \u2019 s time to move on.\n\u201d A group of former Biden expert advisers might agree with her .\nSix scientists who served on the president \u2019 s transition health advisory board on Thursday published a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Medical Association calling for the administration to now focus on what they called \u201c the new normal of life with COVID.\n\u201d Omicron , they said , had \u201c created concern about a perpetual state of emergency.\n\u201d They advocated , among other things , for changes and improvements to testing , vaccine mandates and technology , and data collection .\nBut more than anything , they said the focus needed to be on the future , not the cloud of the current crisis .\n\u201c We think a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see through that smoke to see how this is going to end , and start laying down steps for how we will be able to live a normal life , \u201d one of the scientists , Rick Bright , told the New York Times .\nBoth the APHA \u2019 s Benjamin and the AMA \u2019 s Harmon said they also felt more of a focus on modeling was needed to better predict and respond to future iterations of this virus and others so as to avoid more chaos .\nThat could include extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventative medicine , such as vaccines .\n\u201c The nature of the virus is unpredictable , but that \u2019 s the nature of any enemy , \u201d said Harmon , a retired Air Force major general .\n\u201c Using a military analogy , we need to not fight the current war or previous wars , we need to plan for future engagements .\nWe need to think of asymmetric warfare with this virus.\n\u201d Still , Harmon said , right now an urgent challenge is to try to reach those weary soldiers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Clough in the Bay Area , struggling to see the way forward .\n\u201c Even when things seem nutty , I don \u2019 t have the energy to develop strong opinions and advocate for them like I did in the first shutdown , \u201d Clough said .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t muster the same passion for it that I had earlier .\nI feel tired .\nI feel a little bit resigned to whatever is going to happen.\n\u201d \u25cf",

perpetual state of limbo .\n\u201c I feel like it 's hard to make plans at all now , \u201d said Christina Marfice , 31 , a marketing strategist in Chicago .\n\u201c Everything feels tenuous all the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shoe to drop .\nI 've found it 's better for my mental health to make no plans at all than to try to plan things and have them be canceled or changed , so I 've been living in this indefinite holding pattern since early 2020 .\nIt 's like life is on pause right now with no indication of when it might start moving forward again.\n\u201d \u201c Quite honestly , I ca n't

on some sort of time limit to have fun , and that I \u2019 m failing to meet that goal before time runs out , \u201d said Becca Lo Presti , a recent college grad living in Vermont who never imagined

said Rachel Lalli , 28 , who builds homes in Hanover , Massachusetts .\n\u201c I have little to no social life and have grown very distant from old college and high school friends .\nI am now left to wonder how and when I will find my person .\nWill the world be in a better place ?\n\u201d Dating is one of the first pandemic losses that comes to mind for that 22-year-old student in Utah , where

on a single date since moving here .\nI expected by this point in my life to have had at least one serious relationship.\n\u201d Delays in dating have also meant , for many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Before the pandemic , I had one friend who had a baby , \u201d said Reaganne Hansford , a 25-year-old speechwriter in Washington , DC .\n\u201c Now , I have at least 10 friends with babies they had during the pandemic .\nI don \u2019 t know if their timelines were accelerated by the pandemic , but as someone who was NOT ready to have kids 2 years ago ( and still don \u2019 t feel ready ) it has made having kids really heavy on my mind lately .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t want to be left behind by everyone else , but it has made me reevaluate what I want out of the rest of my 20s.\n\u201d Some people \u2014 myself included \u2014 are questioning whether to have children at all .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve wanted nothing more than to be a mom my whole life , \u201d Lalli said .\n\u201c But should I be bringing more people into this messed up world ?\nIs climate change going to end us ?\nIs it going to get so bad as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our lives again ?\nI know it \u2019 s hard to say , so I keep living for a better day.\n\u201d \u201c I 've stopped thinking about possibly having kids someday , because it feels so impossible as a female-identifying person to go through that with American healthcare and laws being how they are , \u201d said Jessica Clair , a 28-year-old living in the DC area .\n\u201c I also ca n't imagine bringing a kid into this shitshow \u2014 that just feels insanely unfair now.\n\u201d \u201c 2020 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and I would start our journey to becoming parents , \u201d said Teresa Martinez , 33 , who manages a medical office in southern California .\n\u201c We had previously put those plans on hold due to familial obligations .\nHis grandma got sick and passed in 2018 .\nMy father was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018 .\nIt took a toll on us to take on additional responsibilities with our families during this time [ and ] we made the decision to hold off on trying for a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting vaccinated , \u201c we considered trying again , \u201d Martinez said , \u201c but we have seen so much in the last 2 years that it made us really stop to think , do we want to subject a child to this world we live in ?\nBroken healthcare system in the US , broken political system , a capitalistic society in which people of average incomes are unable to afford the cost of living , the rampant racism that exists in this world , etc .\nIs it responsible to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It isn \u2019 t only the potential for future families that people have given up on .\nMany who wrote in noted that they \u2019 ve given up relationships with current family members over the past two years because of fundamental disagreements about COVID safety .\nRachel Friedrick , a 31-year-old writer in Traverse City , Michigan , had her first child , a daughter , in October 2020 .\n\u201c Aside from their initial visit when she was born , we didn \u2019 t see family for the first 6+ months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get vaccinated , \u201d she said .\nSome family members understood while the decision to keep loved ones away ruptured other relationships completely .\n\u201c My husband is a pediatrician and saw Covid patients , so we lived in constant fear that he might bring Covid home to our daughter unknowingly .\nI struggled through an incredibly isolating maternity leave alone , without friends or family , and then returned to my remote work trying to figure out how to balance working with a baby that refused a bottle and wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe first 6 months of my daughter \u2019 s life were some of the most lonely , isolated , and difficult days of my husband and I \u2019 s life .\n\u201c I feel such loss around the entire experience of becoming a parent , \u201d Friedrick continued .\n\u201c Memories like my baby \u2019 s first Christmas only bring up loneliness and pain , especially because of the family relationships that were broken.\n\u201d \u201c When you work in healthcare and are seeing people dying daily in the midst of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships with people who are spreading false narratives about the \u2018 plandemic , \u2019 \u201d Martinez said .\nShe lost multiple friends and family members due to COVID-19 : some of them died of it , and others got swept up in misinformation .\n\u201c Even when trying to explain the reality of the situation , people choose to not believe , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Rather than stress myself out trying to show reality , it was easier to just step away from these relationships and focus on my own mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the future seems uncertain , we can better appreciate how precious time really is .\nThe pandemic has forced many of us to consider how we want to spend our remaining days \u2014 because they are limited , and because they are all we have .\nFor many people , that has meant a radical reconsideration of their relationship with work .\n\u201c My life is more than half over and I fucking wasted it on stupid beliefs that I had to give 110 % to \u2018 the man , \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern California .\n\u201c I should have been doing all that for me \u2014 not stupid work that wouldn \u2019 t even send flowers if I died tomorrow.\n\u201d \u201c My professional life , which was for a long time the anchor of my twenties , feels pretty stupid and meaningless in the context of pandemic remote work , \u201d said Taylor Broadfoot , 30 , who works at a marijuana tech startup in Seattle .\nFor Clair , the pandemic \u201c really reaffirmed that I do n't want work to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said .\n\u201c I never had huge career aspirations but this has made it even more clear that working 60+ hours a week in a salary position is just not worth it.\n\u201d \u201c I lost my entire identity , \u201d said Dani Steeves , a 33-year-old event manager in Ontario , Canada .\n\u201c I did n't realize how intertwined I as a person had become with my job .\nI lost friends who I had worked with for a decade because at a time when I needed them the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , \u201c I am no longer a person who views their future solely in career terms .\nNow that I have seen I am an expendable asset to a company that I had devoted my life to , my future outlook no longer always involves the career I thought I would never leave.\n\u201d Without the potential of a career , romance , or parenthood to give us a sense of identity and purpose , what \u2019 s left ?\n\u201c In some ways , the pandemic actually helped me become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for the future , \u201d said Sydney Spaulding , 23 , a writer in San Diego .\n\u201c When going out all the time was n't an option anymore , it made me really look at myself in the mirror and try to get to know that person better .\nIn a way , that was a positive change that came out of all this.\n\u201d Barry F. Keaveney , a 75-year-old semi-retired photographer in rural Arizona , is focusing on \u201c finding satisfaction in home alone time : watching better movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d He thinks we \u2019 re facing \u201c a dark future with the Covid pandemic , polarized politics , QAnon and Trump haters and liars , real climate threats and a failed Congress to deal with these problems.\n\u201d He \u2019 s coping with the ambiguous losses of the past couple years by \u201c making up for lost time.\n\u201d That means \u201c going around with my new cameras , taking photos , considering getting back to drone videos but with more new and professional gear.\n\u201d \u201c I used to want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am more happy in the moment , \u201d said Maria Natola , a 32-year-old high school teacher in Vancouver .\n\u201c I know what I need to be content and to feel like I am living a full life , and many of the things I thought I \u2018 needed \u2019 have turned out to be nice extras that do n't make or break my life .\nIt 's cliche , but I 've learned that it truly is the little things , and if the little things do n't make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 things.\n\u201d \u201c I think I lost my tolerance for bullshit during the pandemic , \u201d said Jeane Emily DuBose , a 26-year-old who works in medical research in Chicago .\n\u201c I kind of decided that I 'm not going to be afraid of things anymore .\nI decided to start writing the book I 'd been thinking about for years but never actually put to paper .\nI quit grad school .\nI quit my job and found a better one I 'm excited about .\nI started making dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something I enjoy .\nI 've spent so much time being afraid and I decided that I do n't care anymore.\n\u201d \u201c I need to make full use of my pause to really do what I want to do next year , \u201d said Gulati , the 22-year-old Canadian who \u2019 s been reflecting a lot on her mortality .\n\u201c I have to sit down with myself and figure out what that even is .\nI can \u2019 t be afraid of the future , as tiresome as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening right now , and I want to make the most of it .\nI don \u2019 t want to let the past two years dictate the rest of my life .\nI tried to \u2018 live \u2019 this summer \u2014 I slept with more men than deserved it and got too many piercings .\nI want to rediscover what meaning actually means to me and I want to live it .\nFor real , this time.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "If you \u2019 ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately , you may have found long lines , empty shelves , and a frustrating lack of availability in general .\nThis is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country , now about 95 % of cases in the US .\nPresident Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation .\nWhile increased test availability is a good thing , those government-supplied , at-home COVID tests may not be available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be distributed .\nAnd if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests , a lot of questions remain .\nHow reliable are they ?\nWhen should you use them ?\nDo they perform differently with Omicron ?\nHere are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests .\nWhen should you use rapid COVID tests ?\nRapid COVID tests are , well , rapidly becoming a way of life in the US .\nAfter being absent in the US for much of the pandemic , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out \u2014 in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online .\nThe pro is that they give fast results \u2014 in about 15 minutes , allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result .\nThe con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests , like a PCR , that can take a day or more to get results .\n\u201c Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina , a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed , a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing .\n\u201c The government is in a position now where it \u2019 s bringing these tests forward , and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used , \u201d he said Tuesday at a press briefing .\nYou can take a COVID test for any reason at all , but here are the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you have been vaccinated .\n\u2022 If you have COVID symptoms , including cough , shortness of breath , fever , and other respiratory virus symptoms \u2022 Have been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes .\n( If you are unvaccinated , get tested right away ; if you are fully vaccinated , get tested within five to seven days after exposure , according to the CDC . )\n\u2022 If you took part in high-risk activities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially distance as recommended , such as when traveling , in crowded indoor places , or attending large gatherings or mass events Many people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work , school , or before or after travel or events .\nAlthough vaccines , especially when combined with a booster , are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant , \u201c we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated , \u201d CDC chief Rochelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday .\n\u201c These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.\n\u201d Regardless of vaccination status , you should wear a mask in public indoor settings .\nWalensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors \u201c to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.\n\u201d How many different at-home COVID tests are there ?\nThere are now ( at least ) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests , which are the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , and generally cost about $ 20 to $ 35 for two \u2014 if you can find them .\nAn antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus , which can be picked up with a nasal swab .\nKeep in mind that no test is perfect .\nAny given medical test is measured by its sensitivity , or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives , and specificity , how good it is at ruling out people who aren \u2019 t sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA \u2019 s emergency-use authorization : There are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test , but they cost more , Mina said .\nThey include Detect , Cue Health , and Lucira , which can be done at home , as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor \u2019 s offices .\n\u201c Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also fewer of them available .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test , \u201d he said .\nIn general , yes .\nBut you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests , like PCR .\nAnd it \u2019 s important to note , a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet peer reviewed , included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York , Los Angeles , and San Francisco in December 2021 .\nThe people were fully vaccinated , many with boosters .\nThe research team , led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson , compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results .\nThey found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test .\nWhile it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests didn \u2019 t always detect a high viral load , the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests , Adamson told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile , \u201d she said .\n\u201c So I think it will move quickly.\n\u201d False positives are much less common .\nHowever , the chances of a false positive can vary by brand , ranging from one in 150 tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat said , if your rapid test gives a positive result , you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test , like PCR .\nRapid tests are about 30 % to 40 % less sensitive than PCR tests , and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms .\nIn one study , a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35 % in asymptomatic people and 64 % in people with symptoms when compared with PCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to people who tested positive for COVID , whether or not they had symptoms .\nIn the study , there were only a handful of false positives , all in asymptomatic people \u2014 but 47 % were false negatives compared with PCR .\nThese are still good tests !\nIt \u2019 s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more ( often many more ) to get a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy .\n\u201c The test is very good when it \u2019 s positive , but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result , \u201d said Dr. Stanley Weiss , a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey .\nIf you get a negative result , follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to believe that you were exposed or infected .\nWait at least 24 hours for your next test , according to the CDC , but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative .\nMina recommends that if you start having symptoms , assume you have Omicron and self-isolate .\nTake your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later .\nWhen interpreting and making decisions based on a test result , it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account a person \u2019 s history of vaccination , mask use , exposures to others , and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive , Weiss said .\nYes , that seems to be the case , although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant .\nIt makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few PCR-based tests that don \u2019 t and have recommended that labs don \u2019 t use them .\nIf you do have COVID symptoms , can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic ?\nYes , according to Mina .\nThat \u2019 s because early in the pandemic , humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms \u2014 which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus \u2014 started later in the timeline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have either had COVID , been vaccinated , or in some cases both , symptoms generally start sooner .\n( And it \u2019 s clear that you can get COVID two or more times . )\n\u201c You 're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early , \u201d Mina said .\nHe also noted that \u2019 s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose .\n\u201c That \u2019 s your immunity working , \u201d he said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as an antigen test ?\nNot exactly .\nA lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears \u2014 a positive control to show the test is working \u2014 and another line appears if the test is positive .\nWhile all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests , not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests .\nFor example , pregnancy tests also work in this way but use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing .\nCan a rapid test protect you from getting sick ?\nNot really .\nRapid tests are more about protecting other people , not making sure you don \u2019 t get the virus .\n( That \u2019 s what vaccines , masks , and social distancing are all about . )\nHowever , when people get tested before going to work , a party , school , or traveling , it helps protect everyone .\n( Although it also helps you get treatment sooner , which is important because almost all effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the sooner they are started . )\nRapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus , Mina said .\n\u201c For somebody who \u2019 s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people , then the tests are more likely 95 % or 98 % sensitive for those individuals , \u201d he said .",

the RNC resolution accused the lawmakers of \u201c participating in a Democrat-led persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse.\n\u201d RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel later said the line wasn \u2019 t a reference to the violence at the Capitol , but as the New York Times noted , the text didn \u2019 t feature that nuance .\nHowell asked if the government accepted \u201c some responsibility \u201d for \u201c helping to foster some confusion about whether what occurred on Jan. 6 was a protest or legitimate political discourse \u201d by letting defendants plead to the parading charge .\nThe two DOJ lawyers present replied that they couldn \u2019 t speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the judge that Jan. 6 was not \u201c legitimate political discourse.\n\u201d They explained that the government \u2019 s position was that the breach of the Capitol was criminal and that much of what happened was an act of domestic terrorism .\nHowell isn \u2019 t the first judge to call out the RNC \u2019 s \u201c legitimate political discourse \u201d line .\nLast week , US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson referenced it during a sentencing hearing for Mark Leffingwell , who pleaded guilty to punching police officers at the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse and it is not justified to descend on the nation 's Capitol at the direction of a disappointed candidate and disrupt the electoral process , \u201d Jackson said , according to a report from ABC News .\nShe sentenced Leffingwell to six months behind bars and two years of supervised release .\nHowell went even further , asking DOJ lawyers to address the RNC \u2019 s language and suggesting that the government \u2019 s management of the investigation contributed to false narratives that persisted in some conservative circles and GOP efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosecutors focused early waves of plea offers on defendants charged solely with misdemeanor crimes .\nGrace Albinson , an attorney in the DOJ \u2019 s Tax Division detailed to handle Jan. 6 cases , initially responded to Howell \u2019 s criticism by telling the judge that she didn \u2019 t believe that Jan. 6 was a \u201c protest \u201d or \u201c legitimate political discourse.\n\u201d Howell told Albinson that she \u2019 d been \u201c curious \u201d why the Justice Department allowed defendants to plead to the parading offense when there were other charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s all the rioters were doing , the judge said .\nHowell said she wanted to give the government a chance to explain that decision .\nAlbinson replied that the judge \u2019 s question \u201c sort of gets to the policy decisions of management , who are clearly not myself .\nSo I understand your frustration and I understand your argument and your point , but I don \u2019 t feel like I am the person to address it.\n\u201d She apologized .\nHowell didn \u2019 t continue to press Albinson .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , James Pearce .\nPearce , an appellate lawyer in the Criminal Division , has been appearing in Jan. 6 cases to defend the government \u2019 s sentencing recommendations .\nPearce echoed Albinson \u2019 s deference to DOJ policy decisions but also attempted to address the judge \u2019 s concern , saying that it wasn \u2019 t the government \u2019 s role to engage in political discussions about the \u201c political significance \u201d of Jan. 6 .\nPearce said the government was focused on \u201c ensuring criminal responsibility \u201d and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 cases wasn \u2019 t different from other investigations ; they charged the crimes they believed they could prove beyond a reasonable doubt , he said .\nHowell pushed back , telling Pearce that what \u201c strikes me \u201d is that the government historically used the parading offense as a kind of \u201c ticket \u201d for a person who stood up during a hearing and yelled .\nShe said she was \u201c surprised \u201d to see it in connection with Jan. 6 .\nHowell then asked Pearce if he was saying that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d for the fact that there might be \u201c confusion \u201d about Jan. 6 at least in part because defendants were pleading guilty to parading .\n\u201c That was certainly not our intention , \u201d Pearce replied .\nHe said it was \u201c possible \u201d prosecution choices had caused confusion , but also possible that wasn \u2019 t the case .\nLike Albinson , he said that the government didn \u2019 t believe that Jan. 6 was a \u201c protest \u201d or \u201c legitimate political discourse , \u201d and that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many respects \u201d an act of domestic terrorism .\nHowell then moved on , although she raised the concern again during another sentencing hearing later in the morning .\nAs for the defendant before her at the time , Howell sentenced Brian Stenz of Pennsylvania to three years of probation , explaining that she thought it was important to have a \u201c lengthy \u201d period of court supervision that would cover the next two election cycles .\nStenz had previous criminal convictions , and Howell said that record plus the fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s office during the Capitol attack set him apart from other misdemeanor defendants .\nShe ordered him to spend 14 days in jail and two months in home detention as conditions of his probation and imposed a $ 2,500 fine in addition to the $ 500 in restitution he agreed to pay as part of his plea deal .",

        "content": "What they eat , where they go to the bathroom , how they get functioning saunas , and other questions answered .\nOTTAWA \u2014 When Ottawa police let hundreds of protest vehicles drive into the downtown core of the nation 's capital , they did so under the seemingly reasonable assumption that there was no way the demonstrators could stick around in the streets of a city where temperatures regularly dip below 0 degrees Fahrenheit .\nThe police were wrong .\nBacked by donations of cash and supplies , the anti\u2013vaccine mandate protesters have created an off-book supply chain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fed indefinitely .\nThey do this with the help of a separate site \u2014 a parking lot full of vehicles and tents \u2014 that serves as a sort of supply depot and logistics center .\nStaged next to a baseball park on Coventry Road , a few miles east of downtown , it is essentially sanctioned by the city .\nPolice have abandoned hopes of removing protesters for now and are adopting a strategy of containing and keeping watch .\nThat is not to say that police have left it entirely alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed officers executed a nighttime raid on the site , seizing a cache of fuel .\nWhile the vibe downtown feels akin to a Canada Day festival , the Coventry Road site has more of a quasi-military feel .\nJournalists are , generally , not welcome .\nThere have been no reports of violence , but intense-looking guys staring down reporters sends the message .\n\u201c I got the distinct impression that it would be way , way better for me to be somewhere else .\nI left , \u201d Matt Gurney wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first things photographer David Kawai and I saw on Saturday afternoon when we arrived at the site was a white van with \u201c FREDOM \u201d taped on the side .\nIt wasn \u2019 t a typo .\nThe owner of the van said he just ran out of tape .\nWhen I approached the registration tent \u2014 there is a registration tent \u2014 a man who lived nearby said his 16-year-old son wanted to come and volunteer .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a strong boy , he can lift stuff for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing is , he can \u2019 t drive.\n\u201d I identified myself as a reporter with BuzzFeed News .\nThis kicked off a tense and confused few minutes where several people surrounded me , saying they needed to determine if I was good media or bad media .\nOne woman demanded I prove I was who I said I was .\nIt wasn \u2019 t clear who was actually making the final call , but eventually one man stood up for us .\nWe were allowed to enter .\nThe first tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , complete with tables , chairs , supplies , and whiteboards listing names and numbers of key contacts .\nAnother whiteboard listed French and English directions ranging from handling fuel to dealing with police ( \u201c Stay calm/Restez calme , \u201d \u201c Right to remain silent/Vous avez le droit de garder le silence \u201d ) .\nSigns with slogans like \u201c Natural immunity is God \u2019 s science \u201d sat in the corner .\nAfter a bit more haggling over access , we were allowed to enter the main tent .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tables overflowed with supplies .\nFresh produce , canned goods , soap , winter clothing , you name it , it was on offer .\nDozens of people were buzzing about .\nSome were working , some were sitting and enjoying a meal .\n\u201c This is just a place for people to come and warm up , eat , \u201d said Carlo , an organizer from Montreal who did n't want to give his last name .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very heartwarming .\nIt \u2019 s shocking , actually , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get.\n\u201d Carlo said all of the supplies were donated .\nVolunteers transport them downtown as needed , or protesters can come out to Coventry Road for a meal .\nTaped to the exit of the main tent is a photo of a young girl holding a sign saying \u201c The truckers are coming to save us.\n\u201d One of our guides paused to point it out , saying , \u201c This Is What We Do It All For.\n\u201d The operation feels both surprisingly organized and ad hoc .\nAt a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to ask what we were doing and who authorized us to be there .\nMy answer didn \u2019 t seem particularly convincing .\nI said I had been told to call a man named David , who after some discussion gave me permission over the phone to walk around .\nBut no one seemed to know what the proper protocol for handling media was , if one even existed , and no one kicked us out .\nThe longer we hung around , the more the organizers warmed up to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of the camp : two fully functional saunas .\nHe said a guy came and dropped them off out of the blue , telling organizers to use them as long as they want and to give him a call when they \u2019 re done with them .\nSame story for the mobile bathroom unit .\n\u201c Companies are just pouring in and installing stuff for us , whether it \u2019 s mobile bathrooms , kitchen equipment , tents .\nEverything you see here was donated , \u201d he said .\nThere was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it \u2019 s clear the police don \u2019 t want the camp there and they \u2019 ve come a couple of times \u2014 most notably during the fuel raid \u2014 but for the most part have left the camp alone .\nThe people there are , understandably , proud of how much support they \u2019 ve received .\nThrough these donations , they \u2019 ve created a supply chain that has kept the downtown protests going strong for over two weeks now .\n\u201c We \u2019 re here for as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We came here already equipped \u2014 and with the support we \u2019 ve been getting , I think we \u2019 re more than equipped right now to be here for the long term.\n\u201d The Coventry Road supply center is not , however , the movement \u2019 s headquarters , and protesters spend most of their time downtown .\nTop organizers are also elsewhere so that , according to one volunteer , police can \u2019 t move in and round them up .\nThe supply chain manifests in soup kitchens and hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with volunteers doling out free food and drinks to anyone who wants some .\nThe size of the demonstrations notably spikes on weekends , when people drive in from hours away to take part .\nDuring the week , people sleep in their cars and trucks .\nOne question multiple people have asked is : Where do they go to the bathroom ?\nThere are some lines of porta-potties set up throughout the downtown core , but not nearly enough .\nI asked Greg , a protester who has been living out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks , where he relieves himself .\nHe said a lot of the local restaurants , caf\u00e9s , and hotels have let protesters come in and use their bathrooms .\nThis is a bit of a sore spot for residents .\nLast month , one Ottawa resident compiled a crowdsourced , unverified list of businesses \u201c supporting \u201d the convoy , which spread around Instagram and Twitter .\nPeople and businesses strenuously denied the list was accurate .\nConvoy supporters picked up on the witch hunt vibe of the list and spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left .\nMy impression from talking to bar and restaurant workers is that they are having a very trying few weeks .\nSome definitely are letting protesters use their bathrooms , but not as some sign of tacit support for the cause .\nI \u2019 ve heard that businesses don \u2019 t want to anger the protesters and become a target for retaliation .\nThere \u2019 s also just a humanitarian element ; most Canadians aren \u2019 t going to feel good about saying no to someone who badly needs to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greg said many residents in the Ottawa area have extended offers for protesters to come to their homes and wash up .",

        "content": "\u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d In August 2021 , influencer Madison Vining made a big announcement on Instagram .\nAfter becoming one of the top sellers for the multilevel marketing essential oils company Young Living , she was quitting .\nTo her more than 250,000 followers on Instagram and her Young Living team , known as the \u201c Happy Oilers , \u201d the news came as a huge shock .\nYoung Living is one of two of the major essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorker reported in 2017 , along with its main rival DoTerra ( both claim to be the largest oils company in the world , according to the magazine ) .\nBoth reportedly reach $ 1 billion in sales annually and serve millions of customers .\nVining , who had worked for Young Living for more than eight years , had reached \u201c Royal Crown Diamond \u201d status ; sellers with that status make , on average , $ 1,645,692 annually or $ 137,000 a month , according to the company .\nPeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vining and her husband , Tyler , would leave so much money on the table to start from scratch .\nWhen , a few days later , the Vinings announced that they were joining a new wellness-focused MLM , Modere , which is best known for its collagen supplements , rumors swirled that the couple had gotten a huge payout or some other incentive to leave .\nFor months Vining had kept her reasons for leaving Young Living opaque .\nBut recently , she finally began to spill the tea on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave for leaving Young Living ?\nSatan and his demons .\nYes , the prince of darkness .\nVining is just one former top Young Living retailer who this month has either insinuated or flat-out said that they left the company after feeling , as devout Christians , that demonic forces were spreading \u201c darkness \u201d among Young Living members .\nOne former seller , Melissa Truitt , went as far as labeling the company a \u201c cult \u201d in an Instagram story highlight she posted to her account last week and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oily \u201c satanic panic \u201d by posting her series of Instagram stories last week accusing the company of spreading \u201c demonic \u201d propaganda through a New Age self-help book it sent to its members earlier this year .\nShe urged Christians still working for Young Living to flee or risk their souls .\n\u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d Truitt said in an emotional Instagram story .\nTruitt did not return a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not either , and shortly after I reached out , she blocked me on Instagram .\nIn response to the claims , Young Living said it \u201c did not publish and does not endorse this book in any way.\n\u201d In a statement , the company said that the book \u2019 s co-author , Marcella Vonn Harting , who is a top seller at the company , sent the book to \u201c her own list without the company \u2019 s knowledge or consent.\n\u201d The company denied providing Vonn Harting with anyone \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not return a request for comment ) .\n\u201c We support a culture of inclusion that we extend to our employees , customers , and brand partners world-wide , \u201d the statement read .\n\u201c We appreciate and celebrate our members and their diversity of background and belief , and are dedicated to ensuring our brand partners follow our policies and procedures and code of ethics.\n\u201d The influencers and former Young Living retailers \u2019 abrupt declarations that the company is satanic are odd to say the least , especially as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jumped ship to Modere over the past several months , before even receiving the book .\nTruitt , who had reached the second-highest \u201c Diamond \u201d status , also left Young Living five months ago to join Modere .\nAnd other big Young Living sellers slash influencers , like Liz Joy of Pure Joy Home and Monique McLean , abruptly announced they were switching to Modere recently as well .\nIn fact , so many prominent top Young Living sellers have been leaving that last August Young Living sued some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , for breach of contract .\nThe lawsuit , which was filed in federal court in Utah in August 2021 , was dismissed that December at the request of both sides .\nStill , it provides valuable insight into the breakup of the prominent Instagram essential oil sellers and the company .\nIn the complaint , Young Living accused the McLeans and the Vinings of working to cut a deal with Modere to \u201c raid \u201d Young Living \u2019 s business .\n( McLean did not return a request for comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for comment . )\n\u201c The named defendants in this case are former , extremely successful Young Living distributors who have meticulously executed a plan to leave Young Living , join a competing business venture , and take as many Young Living distributors and customers with them as possible , \u201d the lawsuit \u2019 s complaint read .\nYoung Living declined to comment on the lawsuit .\nBut now , the influencers are saying that money or alleged backdoor schemes had nothing to do with their decision to leave .\nVining wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the \u201c tip of the iceberg on this issue , \u201d and she feels better after \u201c denouncing this spiritual darkness \u201d to her followers .\n\u201c I feel a lot of clarity breaking my silence for things that matter in eternity , \u201d she wrote .\nThe denouncement of Young Living as demonic is especially intriguing because so many of its retailers , Vining included , have spent the past several years blending together the principles of alternative wellness and medicine the company espouses with their evangelical Christian beliefs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1993 by D. Gary Young , a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who successfully blended his own devout faith with a lifelong passion for alternative remedies .\nIn a newsletter to Young Living members after her husband \u2019 s death in 2018 , Gary \u2019 s wife , Mary , wrote that her husband \u2019 s desire to spread the gospel of essential oils was closely tied to his faith , writing , \u201c God was his foundation.\n\u201d \u201c He founded the essential oil movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never stopped in his desire to serve God \u2019 s children , \u201d Young wrote .\nFor many years , alternative remedies like essential oils were stereotyped to be the purview of hippie-dippie rich people , but , as Rachel Monroe wrote in the New Yorker in 2017 , essential oils have also caught on more broadly among women all over the US .\n\u201c Wellness is often dismissed as frivolity , another way for wealthy white women to spend money and obsess about their bodies , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find essential oils in a small-town drugstore in the Midwest as in an organic market in L.A. \u201d Over the past decade or so , many of the devotees who made it big in Young Living shared similarities with Vining .\nThey were young wives and mothers in the heartland who were devoted evangelical Christians , and they also seemed to have a suspicion of mainstream medicine .\nAccording to Vining , once she stopped buying mainstream medicinal and home products and dove into essential oils , her life changed dramatically .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family had decided to start a \u201c wellness journey \u201d three years before after learning about \u201c the dangers lurking in our home that were making us sick.\n\u201d \u201c There are ingredients in everyday things like baby lotion , dish soap , dryer sheets\u2026 all linked to cancer , infertility , and disease .\nWe just didn \u2019 t know , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c We slowly but surely took a trash bag through our home and began to read labels .\nInto the trash bag went candles , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was setting us or our kiddos up for failure with our health.\n\u201d Vining never specified what ingredients exactly were making her family sick but claimed that once she threw out the products she saw a huge difference .\nAnd once she found Young Living and began using oils , Vining claimed , her family no longer needed to rely on \u201c toxic \u201d Western medicine .\n\u201c We use essential oils for everything in our home , from seasonal irritations outdoors , to first aid type of things , to helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good stuff , and of course restful sleep !\n\u201d she wrote .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve blessed our family so so much.\n\u201d As the Vinings \u2019 platform grew ( in 2017 , Vining wrote she had 58,000 people under her in the business ) , the couple used the proceeds from their essential oil business to spread the gospel of Jesus , effectively combining the two parts of her life .\n\u201c Our prayer has always been that we would use our influence to point everything back to The One who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c We know that this money and this opportunity and this voice have not been given to us because of anything WE have done , and they are not ours.\n\u201d In 2017 , Vining and another Young Living seller made a goal to get Young Living oils into a school in Uganda that was founded by an American evangelical Christian missionary .\nThe Vinings and their partners were eventually able to raise enough funds to get oils and diffusers into every dorm room and classroom at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students \u201c appropriate wellness supplies to prevent icky diseases and unwellness , \u201d Vining wrote .\nShe felt that this plan was a calling from God .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about more than oils , you guys , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s ALWAYS been about so much more than oils .\nIt \u2019 s about \u2018 wellness , purpose , and abundance \u2019 ( YL \u2019 s slogan ) and it \u2019 s about using ANY platform we are given , to glorify the King.\n\u201d Vining \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career on social media , where she became a prominent Young Living influencer .\nAs her prominence within the \u201c oiler community \u201d grew , so did her online presence , and she went from having 56,000 Instagram followers in September 2018 to more than 200,000 when she quit the company in August 2021 .\nMany other Young Living sellers also found success on social media , where they were able to share their devout faith and their enviable lifestyles while also recruiting new downlines , or Young Living retailers who report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Crown Diamond who was sued by Young Living along with the Vinings last year , grew her platform to more than 29,000 Instagram followers and launched a book and video series called 24 Days of Prayer for Your Business .\nIn the series , McLean led followers virtually on a spiritual devotional aimed at centering their faith in their business ventures , Young Living or otherwise .\nTruitt , who has more than 43,000 Instagram followers , is also open about her Christian faith , often discussing her religion along with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellness , and fitness .\nIt is because these oil peddlers connected their spirituality so closely with their careers that their sudden insistence that the company is now somehow anti-Christian has been so jarring .\nBut according to the oilers , after years of success in Young Living they had begun to feel a darkness creep into the company and that \u2019 s what led them to leave .\nLast week , Truitt kicked off the public drama when she posted a series of Instagram stories about issues she had had with Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven good years of selling Young Living and reaching the second-highest Diamond status , she and her husband began to feel like the company was \u201c changing , \u201d and not for the better .\nTruitt didn \u2019 t specify what these changes were , saying they \u201c couldn \u2019 t really pinpoint it , \u201d but \u201c we heard things that didn \u2019 t really agree with our spirit.\n\u201d After praying about it , they decided to resign from Young Living at the end of 2021 .\n\u201c We knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , \u201d she said .\nTruitt said that , despite having resigned last fall , she received a \u201c demonic \u201d book in the mail earlier this month that she thought was sent from Young Living .\nShe said the company had sent it to all its Diamond-level sellers and claimed that Mary Young , the wife of the late founder , had encouraged the leaders to read the book and pass it along to their downlines .\nThe book , titled My Word Made Flesh , is cowritten by a self-help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a company called Mastery Systems ( Stevens did not return a request for comment ) .\nStevens describes himself on his website as a \u201c masterful facilitator of individuals and organizations that choose to transform their lives into healthy , creative , loving and fulfilling experiences.\n\u201d Stevens wrote the book with Vonn Harting , a Young Living Royal Crown Diamond who moonlights as a motivational speaker , and Young wrote the foreword .\nThe spokesperson for Young Living said Young \u2019 s choice to contribute to the book was separate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Young \u2019 s choice to write a foreword stemmed from her own belief about the use of language to promote positive outcomes and her desire to support a friend , \u201d they said .\n\u201c She wrote her foreword prior to much of the book even being written based on the authors \u2019 intent to teach people how to use positive language to help bring about change in their lives.\n\u201d I attempted to get a copy of My Word Made Flesh to see what it actually contained , but after placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mastery Systems \u2019 website , my order was canceled and refunded with no explanation .\nMy Word Made Flesh has now been scrubbed from the website .\nAccording to Truitt , when she received the book and flipped through it , she was horrified .\n\u201c This book is one of the most darkest and demonic books I \u2019 ve ever had in my house , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I can not wait to get rid of it but I had to share.\n\u201d In Truitt \u2019 s video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says is My Word Made Flesh .\nThe \u201c demonic \u201d elements of the book , Truitt claimed , include encouraging people to do basically a \u201c seance with oils \u201d and telling them to repeat \u201c I am the resurrection and the life of my lineage.\n\u201d In the Bible , Jesus calls himself \u201c the way , the truth and the life , \u201d and says \u201c no one comes to the Father [ God ] except through me.\n\u201d To Christians like Truitt , she explained , the book \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to imply you are supplanting Jesus \u2019 s spot .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing more false than that , \u201d she says in her Instagram story .\n\u201c Then taking Jesus out of it and putting yourself in there.\n\u201d Truitt warned \u201c believers \u201d who were still in Young Living that if they did what the company asked and brought the book into their household , \u201c it will completely ruin you.\n\u201d \u201c Leaders of Young Living , you received this book , and so if you are hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condoning this evil , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And if you promote it , you need a serious heart check.\n\u201d \u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And you have to stand up and rise up and run from this.\n\u201d Vining soon posted on her Instagram stories in support of Truitt , saying that she was proud of Truitt for sharing \u201c the truth.\n\u201d \u201c Believers be discerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy [ Satan ] prowls like a lion , and he can look ( and smell ) really good\u2026 this isn \u2019 t about a book .\nThough that book alone would have been a deal breaker for me\u2026 this is the tip of the iceberg on this issue.\n\u201d Vining added she was praying for clarity to speak out more about her experience with Young Living but knew she had to denounce this \u201c spiritual darkness.\n\u201d The reaction from Truitt \u2019 s community to her denouncement of Young Living was overwhelmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and for speaking out against \u201c evil.\n\u201d One woman wrote she had considered signing up for Young Living but would not after seeing Truitt \u2019 s stories .\nPeople also slammed Young Living on social media after Truitt spoke out , saying they were blending \u201c oils and the occult.\n\u201d \u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d wrote one .\nOther Instagram accounts , like Christian podcast host Blake Guichet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company is \u201c anti-Biblical.\n\u201d Guichet had previously posted \u201c deep dives \u201d into the supposed darkness in Young Living and said she wasn \u2019 t surprised to see Truitt \u2019 s stories .\n\u201c I knew Young Living was into some dark stuff , and everyone thought I was crazy , \u201d she said .\nSince posting about the book , Truitt has erased all mention of her claims from her account .\nShe continues to post memes about spiritual warfare , uploading a C.S .\nLewis quote that reads : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe .\nEvery square inch , every split second is claimed by God , and counterclaimed by Satan.\n\u201d Both Truitt and Vining are now preaching the benefits of their new company Modere , which you can swipe up on their accounts to buy , or even sell , products from if you choose .\n\u201c God did design our bodies to move , \u201d Truitt wrote on Instagram stories , adding , \u201c I have been using Modere products for a while and it \u2019 s just been so different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just flowing out of me.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Young Living \u2019 s social accounts have so far been silent on the controversy .\nThey continue to post about the benefits of oils , encouraging their 1 million followers to \u201c focus on you by taking some time out to practice mindfulness with your favorite essential oil blend.\n\u201d Their followers filled up their comments section with hearts .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "Whether you know it or not , your home is filled with microscopic particles and other invisible pollutants that may affect your health to some degree .\nSoot from candles , fumes emitted by furniture , microfibers from laundry , and proteins shed by pets or pests can all irritate your lungs .\nEven the dust hiding under your bed can be filled with allergy-triggering mites .\nIn fact , exposure to pollutants is sometimes worse inside your home than out , which isn \u2019 t great considering the average American spends almost 90 % of their time inside .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution levels may be two to five , and sometimes more than 100 , times higher than those outside .\nOne of the most common sources of indoor air pollution might be sitting in your kitchen : a gas stove .\nThe natural gas it burns is made up primarily of methane ( 70\u201390 % ) , along with ethane , butane , and propane .\nWhen burned , the gas emits a cluster of byproducts , many of which can be harmful .\nMore than 40 million US homes contain the appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of precise heat control .\nHowever , gas stoves are also reentering the spotlight namely for their role in climate change .\nIn December , the New York City mayor signed a bill banning gas-powered stoves , furnaces , and hot water heaters in new buildings beginning in 2023 .\nOther cities in California and Washington have issued similar bans .\nThe potential impact of gas stoves on the climate is real .\nJust last month , Eric Lebel and colleagues at Stanford University published a study in the journal Environmental Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent greenhouse gas , leaks from gas stoves even while off .\nThe researchers visited 53 California homes and rental properties between January 2020 and May 2021 and tested 18 brands of gas cooktops ranging from 3 to 30 years old .\nThey estimate that the annual methane produced by US gas stoves has a climate impact equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from about half a million gas-powered cars .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that methane , although it lingers in the air for less time than carbon dioxide , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 times greater than its greenhouse gas cousin over a 20-year period .\nWhile gas stoves \u2019 effect on climate is the primary motivator behind much of the newer regulations and research , the pollutants the appliances release may affect your health , too .\nWhy are people concerned about gas stoves ?\nIn addition to methane , gas stoves emit carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxide , particulate matter , nitrogen dioxide , and formaldehyde ( a known carcinogen ) every time you bring those blue flames to life .\nA 2008 EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 50 % to more than 400 % higher average nitrogen dioxide concentrations than homes with electric stoves .\nWhether these toxic pollutants can hurt your lungs depends on the level and length of exposure , but they are more harmful for some people than others .\nNitrogen dioxide , in particular , has been linked to respiratory conditions , like asthma .\nA 2014 study used models to estimate that gas stoves expose about 12 million Californians to nitrogen dioxide levels and another 1.7 million to carbon monoxide levels that exceed ambient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a typical winter week .\nGenerally , \u201c any time there is ongoing exposure to something other than oxygen , \u201d your lungs will suffer , Dr. Jamie Garfield , an associate professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at the Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News .\nThe recent Stanford study also measured nitrogen dioxide levels .\nIn just a few minutes of cooking , people who didn \u2019 t use range hoods or had poor ventilation , especially in smaller kitchens , were exposed to nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s guidelines for one-hour outdoor exposure .\n( There are no regulations on indoor air pollution in the US . )\nThe amount of pollutants in the air may also depend on your gas stove \u2019 s cleanliness , general maintenance , and surrounding conditions , such as ventilation and kitchen size .\nHowever , the Stanford study found no relationship between the age and cost of a stove and its emissions .\nThe American Public Gas Association noted the Stanford study did not look at the type of food being cooked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect indoor air pollution levels , or compare gas to other types of stoves .\nBoth gas and electric stoves release emissions and \u201c federal agencies do not consider gas ranges to be a health hazard for consumers , \u201d it said in a statement .\nSome people face greater health risks from gas stoves than others The health risks from gas stoves can vary from person to person , according to Garfield .\nGenerally , healthy people , or those with larger or well-ventilated kitchens where gasses can dissipate , don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c To the individual sitting at that stove cooking dinner for their family , I do n't think there 's reason to be concerned , \u201d Garfield said .\nHowever , that may not be the case for people with respiratory illnesses or conditions , she said , such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\nCOPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is the fourth leading cause of death in the US .\n\u201c I would n't say that every respiratory disease or chronic illness is likely to worsen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , but certainly a disease that is related to the frequency and intensity of respiratory inhalant exposure will fare more poorly in this type of environment , \u201d Garfield said .\nThe risks may also be more pronounced in children , older adults , and people living in lower-income households .\nA meta-analysis of 41 studies published between 1977 and 2013 from across the globe found that children living in homes with gas stoves have a 32 % higher risk of asthma compared with children who do not live in homes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk was \u201c relatively small , \u201d the public health impact is \u201c considerable \u201d given the number of homes with gas stoves .\nOne group of people that hasn \u2019 t been studied as well is restaurant workers , who spend hours each day working in kitchens with the gas-powered appliances .\n( In fact , the new NYC regulation has an exemption for the use of gas stoves in commercial kitchens . )\n\u201c Our culinary population is in the trenches day in and day out for 10+ hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody has studied it as of yet , \u201d Chef Christopher Galarza , founder and culinary sustainability consultant for Forward Dining Solutions , a Pennsylvania-based business that helps other businesses switch to electric kitchen appliances , told BuzzFeed News in an email .\n\u201c When that time comes , we are going to be blown away by the data.\n\u201d Galarza said none of the chefs he \u2019 s worked with on the East Coast are mindful of indoor air quality in their workplace , partly because he , and likely others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas industry calling it \u2018 clean burning gas.\n\u2019 \u201d He noted there are no systems in place , other than range hoods above stove tops , to protect restaurant staff from constant exposure to gas stove fumes .\nBut executive chef Rachelle Boucher , an electric kitchen expert and owner of Kitchens to Life , said \u201c the tide is turning.\n\u201d \u201c Food service workers are beginning to question our old mindset of being tough , working through exhaustion and injury , and putting our health last , \u201d Boucher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do to lower exposure to gas stove pollutants There are steps you can take to lower your exposure and risks .\nBut for some people , like those living in lower-income housing , it may be harder to take appropriate or necessary action .\nLower-income homes are more likely to be located in areas with high levels of outdoor air pollution , which also increases asthma risks , and to have inadequate ventilation .\nA 2019 study found people living in low-income homes with good ventilation had better lung function than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , published in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology , included more than 250 children and adults living in Colorado .\nAlways turn exhaust fans or range hoods on while cooking ( even though they may be noisy ) .\nIt \u2019 s a simple and effective tactic , yet many people forget or choose not to do it .\nA 2010\u20132011 survey of more than 370 Californians found 40\u201360 % of respondents didn \u2019 t use their exhaust hood or open their windows while cooking .\nYou \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at least five minutes after cooking to collect any lingering pollutants .\nIf you can control it , try to ensure exhaust fans or range hoods vent to the outside ; although there are no federal regulations that require it , some states have their own laws in place .\nStill , there aren \u2019 t any standards to ensure venting is adequate , according to Brady Seals , a manager in the Carbon-Free Buildings program at RMI \u2014 a nonprofit that works on sustainability research \u2014 and coauthor of a 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas stove pollution and health .\nMeanwhile , other gas appliances like hot water heaters and furnaces are required to vent outside in some states .\nHere are some other ways to lower exposure to gas stove pollutants : \u2022 Open windows or doors while cooking ; just five minutes has a large impact , Seals said \u2022 Install low-level ( more sensitive ) carbon monoxide detectors in your home \u2022 When possible , cook on the back burners , which are closer to ventilation systems \u2022 Clean filters on your exhaust hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan , but only if it \u2019 s blowing air out an open window or door \u2022 Make sure your gas stove flame tip is blue ; a yellow-tipped flame indicates improper adjustment and increased pollution \u2022 You can keep children away from the kitchen while cooking to reduce health risks , but Seals said some studies have shown gas stove pollutants can make their way into kids \u2019 bedrooms Seals said you can buy a low-cost air quality monitor if you want , but keep in mind its sensitivity and accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the best .\nThose devices are better at detecting particles floating in the air .\nYou can also switch to an electric stove if you can .\nIf not , regularly maintain and clean your gas stove , and consider having a professional inspect all pipe connections to make sure there aren \u2019 t any leaks .\nSeals suggests using a plug-in induction cooktop or other electric appliances , such as kettles , toasters , microwaves , and instant pots , to reduce gas stove use .\nInduction cooktops use electromagnetic energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating the surface of the range .\n\u201c I 'm not telling anyone that they need to rip out their gas stove right now and replace it .\nBut when your gas stove dies or when it 's time for a new one , maybe consider electric or induction as an alternative , \u201d Seals said .\nHow do gas stoves compare with other health threats in your home ?\nBecause there isn \u2019 t \u201c a full national accounting of asthma triggers , \u201d Seals said it \u2019 s hard to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other indoor pollutants , including paint products , cockroaches , candles , cleaning supplies , dust mites , pet dander , secondhand cigarette smoke , mold , and carpets .\nA 2017 report by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that gas stoves were the most commonly cited indoor environmental trigger of children \u2019 s asthma symptoms , slightly more than pet dander or having carpets or rugs in the bedroom .\nThe other main indoor asthma triggers were wood-burning fireplaces or stoves , pets in the bedroom , mice or rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report looked at survey data from 2006\u20132010 about triggers or exacerbation of symptoms in children already diagnosed with asthma . )\nTo reduce the risk of asthma and lung problems in general , you should routinely clean food crumbs from the floor , dust furniture , and have professionals check for more serious pollutants such as mold , radon , lead , and asbestos .\n\u201c There are a lot of things that we can do as individuals to reduce our exposure , but we need policymakers to [ step up ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are benefitting from some of it first , \u201d Seals said .\n\u201c There really has never been a more urgent time to address gas stove pollution for climate and for health than now

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former president Donald Trump on Friday lost his effort to get a set of lawsuits tossed out that seek to hold him responsible for the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 , with a judge rejecting Trump \u2019 s claims of absolute immunity and protection under the First Amendment .\nIn a 112-page opinion , US District Judge Amit Mehta found that it was \u201c plausible \u201d to allege that Trump would have known that his supporters \u2014 including members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys extremist groups named as his codefendants \u2014 were prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on Jan. 6 he delivered a \u201c call to action.\n\u201d Sitting presidents are generally immune from being sued for their official actions , the judge wrote , but Trump \u2019 s tweets urging his supporters to come to Washington to support his false claims of voter fraud , followed by his rally speech urging the crowd to \u201c fight \u201d and telling them to go to the Capitol , did not fall under that umbrella .\n\u201c Based on these allegations , it is reasonable to infer that before January 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of his words and that , when asked , some of his supporters would do as he wished .\nOn January 6th they did so , \u201d Mehta wrote .\n\u201c When he called on them to march to the Capitol , some responded , \u2018 Storm the Capitol.\n\u2019 Thousands marched down Pennsylvania Avenue as directed .\nAnd , when some were inside the Capitol , they told officers , \u2018 We were invited here by the President of the United States.\n\u2019 \u201d The ruling , which Trump is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits filed by Democrats in Congress and US Capitol Police officers that accuse Trump of conspiring to disrupt Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral College results and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power .\nThe judge denied motions to dismiss filed on behalf of the Oath Keepers and Enrique Tarrio , the leader of the Proud Boys .\nMehta separately is presiding over three criminal cases involving the Oath Keepers , including the first prosecution brought by the Justice Department in connection with Jan. 6 that charges defendants with seditious conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other codefendants fared better .\nLongtime Trump ally and occasional Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani also spoke at the rally before the attack on the Capitol , referencing \u201c trial by combat , \u201d but Mehta found that his comments couldn \u2019 t be interpreted as a \u201c call to action.\n\u201d The allegations were \u201c even thinner \u201d when it came to Trump \u2019 s eldest son , Donald Trump Jr. , Mehta concluded , finding that Trump Jr.s \u2019 \u201c false claims \u201d about election fraud and criticism of Republican officials who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all protected speech .\nMehta didn \u2019 t rule on a bid by Republican Rep. Mo Brooks to have the Justice Department step in to defend him in the case , instead providing Brooks with a roadmap to simply have the claims against him tossed out : The judge wrote that he believed Brooks would prevail for the same reason that he \u2019 d dismissed the claims against Giuliani and Trump Jr. Trump \u2019 s lead attorney Jesse Binnall did not immediately return a request for comment .\nJoseph Sellers , a lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress who are plaintiffs in one of the cases , said in a statement : \u201c This decision exhibits the finest tradition of our legal system \u2013 evaluating cases on their merits , not politics .\nWe will continue to pursue justice through the courts and ensure accountability for this attack on our democracy.\n\u201d Trump \u2019 s challenges to the lawsuits involved sweeping claims of absolute immunity and First Amendment protection as well as more specific arguments that the plaintiffs had failed to present enough facts at this early stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that he \u2019 d been part of a conspiracy .\nMehta began with the immunity argument .\nHe largely rejected Trump \u2019 s arguments that he was shielded by absolute presidential immunity because his actions leading up to Jan. 6 \u2014 in particular , his tweets falsely claiming the election was stolen and calling his supporters to Washington \u2014 and during that day fell within his duties as a sitting president .\nMehta wrote that Trump and his attorneys had made a \u201c misleading \u201d and \u201c wrong \u201d argument that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution that empowers presidents to \u201c take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\n\u201d A president had no power over Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral College results or the vice president \u2019 s role in those proceedings as the president of the Senate , the judge wrote .\nTrump \u2019 s argument that he couldn \u2019 t be sued for anything he said related to Jan. 6 because he was speaking on \u201c matters of public concerns \u201d also failed , Mehta found .\nThe judge agreed that public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they said in their official roles , but that Trump \u2019 s \u201c proposed test \u2014 that whenever and wherever a President speaks on a matter of public concern he is immune from civil suit \u2014 goes too far.\n\u201d Mehta didn \u2019 t offer a blanket rule for when a president \u2019 s public comments would or would not be immune , writing instead that \u201c the context in which those words are spoken and what is said matter.\n\u201d The judge parsed whether Trump \u2019 s tweets and rally speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that they did not .\n\u201c After all , the President \u2019 s actions here do not relate to his duties of faithfully executing the laws , conducting foreign affairs , commanding the armed forces , or managing the Executive Branch .\nThey entirely concern his efforts to remain in office for a second term , \u201d Mehta wrote .\nMehta did dismiss a separate claim raised only in Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell \u2019 s lawsuit that sought to hold Trump liable for failing to use his power to immediately call off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf a president couldn \u2019 t be liable for their official duties , that same immunity had to extend to decisions not to use that authority , the judge held .\nMehta rejected Trump \u2019 s arguments that these cases involved a \u201c political question \u201d that courts couldn \u2019 t get involved in \u2014 the judge had already found Trump wasn \u2019 t carrying out official duties \u2014 and that the cases couldn \u2019 t go forward because they mirrored the charges that he \u2019 d been acquitted of in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year .\nThe next big question was whether the plaintiffs laid out enough facts and allegations to claim that Trump engaged in a conspiracy to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power .\nMehta found that they had .\nHe pointed out that a conspiracy , under the law , didn \u2019 t have to involve an \u201c express agreement \u201d \u2014 that is , there didn \u2019 t need to be evidence that Trump physically sat down with the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys and reached an agreement to storm the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c share the same general conspiratorial objective , \u201d the judge wrote .\nMehta wrote that there were \u201c multiple factors \u201d that made it possible for the plaintiffs to show that Trump was part of the conspiracy to disrupt Congress .\n\u201c [ I ] t is at least plausible to infer that , when he called on rally-goers to march to the Capitol , the President did so with the goal of disrupting lawmakers \u2019 efforts to certify the Electoral College votes .\nThe Oath Keepers , the Proud Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Capitol building plainly shared in that unlawful goal , \u201d Mehta wrote .\nMehta highlighted Trump \u2019 s public acknowledgment of the Proud Boys and wrote that it was likely that he knew about the Oath Keepers and that these groups , along with his other supporters , were \u201c prepared to partake in violence for him.\n\u201d He highlighted the intense engagement that Trump \u2019 s supporters had with his pre\u2013Jan .\n6 calls to come to Washington , the \u201c call-and-response \u201d element of the rally when Trump addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the collective \u201c we.\n\u201d \u201c The President and his advisors allegedly \u2018 actively monitored \u2019 websites where supporters made violent posts , and such posts were discussed on Fox News , a media outlet regularly viewed by the President .\nHe also would have known about violent threats made against state election officials , which he had refused to condemn .\nThe President thus plausibly would have known that a call for violence would be carried out by militia groups and other supporters , \u201d Mehta wrote .\nOnce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , Trump \u2019 s decision to continue to criticize then\u2013vice president Mike Pence via Twitter and to post a supportive message to \u201c great patriots \u201d later in the day could be seen as \u201c tacit agreement \u201d of the conspiracy .\nTrump \u2019 s argument that he was making \u201c political statements \u201d aimed at persuading other politicians \u201c misses the forest for the trees , \u201d Mehta wrote .\n\u201c For months , the President led his supporters to believe the election was stolen .\nWhen some of his supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to condemn them .\nRallies in Washington , D.C. , in November and December 2020 had turned violent , yet he invited his supporters to Washington , D.C. , on the day of the Certification .\nThey came by the thousands .\nAnd , following a 75-minute speech in which he blamed corrupt and weak politicians for the election loss , he called on them to march on the very place where Certification was taking place , \u201d Mehta wrote .\n\u201c The President \u2019 s narrow characterization of his conduct accounts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected Trump \u2019 s argument that his rally speech was protected under the First Amendment .\nMehta found that parts of the speech were \u201c plausibly words of incitement \u201d that weren \u2019 t entitled to constitutional protection , including : \u201c [ W ] e fight .\nWe fight like hell and if you don \u2019 t fight like hell , you \u2019 re not going to have a country anymore , \u201d and \u201c [ W ] e \u2019 re going to try to and give [ weak Republicans ] the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to take back our country \u201d right before he told his supporters to \u201c walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\u201d Referencing a 19th-century philosophical treatise , Mehta wrote that Trump \u2019 s speech was \u201c akin to telling an excited mob that corn-dealers starve the poor in front of the corn-dealer \u2019 s home.\n\u201d \u201c He invited his supporters to Washington , D.C. , after telling them for months that corrupt and spineless politicians were to blame for stealing an election from them ; retold that narrative when thousands of them assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to march on the Capitol building \u2014 the metaphorical corn-dealer \u2019 s house \u2014 where those very politicians were at work to certify an election that he had lost , \u201d the judge wrote .\nMehta wrote that some , but not all , of the other claims that the plaintiffs had raised under District of Columbia law , including negligence and aiding and abetting common assault , could go forward .\nHe dismissed an emotional distress claim raised by Swalwell .",

        "content": "On Monday , Boudin said his office learned that San Francisco \u2019 s crime lab has been inputting DNA collected from sexual assault victims into an internal database that \u2019 s used to identify suspects .\nThe discovery was made , he said , after a prosecutor figured out that police apparently linked a woman to a recent property crime using evidence collected from a rape exam in 2016 .\nBoudin and other city officials promptly denounced the practice as morally reprehensible and legally dubious , saying that police may have violated the woman \u2019 s constitutional rights .\nPolice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lab \u2019 s practices , but said there \u2019 s a little more nuance to the case at hand .\nAt a police commission meeting this week , Scott explained that the database used to connect the woman in this case was for \u201c quality assurance \u201d and that investigators also found a match in a criminal database to link her to the crime .\n\u201c We will reform what needs to be reformed , \u201d he said , according to KTVU .\n\u201c But there \u2019 s a lot more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not year clear how long San Francisco police have been employing the practice or how many survivors may have been implicated in crimes unrelated to their sexual assault using DNA they provided for the sole purpose of identifying their assailant .\n( The district attorney \u2019 s office has since dropped the charges against the woman in the case in question as it investigates the issue . )\nBut while speaking to reporters about the discovery at a news conference Tuesday , Boudin said the city \u2019 s crime lab has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kits \u201c as a matter of routine practice \u201d and that it \u2019 s likely other crime labs in California \u2014 and possibly elsewhere in the US \u2014 have been doing the same thing .\n\u201c What we understand is that crime labs that collect and process DNA from survivors of sexual assault do not limit the use of that DNA to the sexual assault case .\nInstead , they built a database with it and that \u2019 s , as we \u2019 re told , not specific to San Francisco \u2014 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Boudin said .\n\u201c It 's highly problematic wherever it happens , whether it 's in San Diego or Sacramento , for the same reasons it 's problematic here.\n\u201d But officials in those very jurisdictions he named , and others across the state , told BuzzFeed News that \u2019 s not how they operate .\n\u201c The short answer is no , \u201d said Bruce Houlihan , director of Orange County \u2019 s crime lab .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve never done that , never will.\n\u201d Houlihan said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Combined DNA Index System ( CODIS ) , a national database used to match genetic samples collected from crime scenes to those of people convicted of or , in some cases , simply arrested for crimes .\nUnder CODIS rules , agencies can not upload victim samples , which are collected to eliminate their genetic information from that of suspects , into state and national databases .\nHowever , local jurisdictions may operate their own separate databases for local use only , and such programs are not regulated by the state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OC lab does not keep its own internal database ( though he said the county \u2019 s district attorney does ) .\nIn Alameda County , which is located east of San Francisco on the other side of the Bay Bridge , the sheriff \u2019 s crime lab does keep an internal database of suspect , victim , and lab employee genetic information to rule out cross-contamination , but the DNA profiles held there are never used \u201c to affect investigations , \u201d sheriff \u2019 s spokesperson Lt. Ray Kelly told BuzzFeed News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of or ever did I see we use a DNA sample from a rape victim to then later use it to \u2026 make a case against a rape victim , \u201d Kelly said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t even know how or why you would do that.\n\u201d Kelly said it would be \u201c unethical \u201d to use victims \u2019 DNA in that way \u2014 and unnecessary \u2014 as he expressed dismay over the accusation by the San Francisco prosecutor .\n\u201c I do n't appreciate it from our side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , \u201d he said .\nBut just because other law enforcement officials say they \u2019 re not using sexual assault survivors \u2019 DNA in the way described by Boudin , it doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s not happening elsewhere , said Cooper , the vice president of public policy for RAINN .\n\u201c It \u2019 s sending shockwaves across the country , and I 'm worried that there are going to be victims out there that are going to be afraid to seek medical care because of this , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already working with members of the US Senate to draft legislation to prohibit the practice Boudin described in San Francisco , Cooper said , adding that she wanted survivors to know that her group has their backs .\nBoudin did not give a straight answer when asked whether the practice he described was legal , but said during Tuesday \u2019 s news conference he had \u201c grave concerns \u201d about it , citing federal protections against unreasonable searches and seizures and state laws outlining victims \u2019 rights .\nUnder the California Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them when it is no longer needed as evidence .\n\u201c Here , biological material , DNA evidence that belongs to sexual assault survivors that \u2019 s gathered from them in the most invasive manner any of us can even think of is being stored and used and not returned or destroyed in a database that we know goes back to at least 2016 if not longer , \u201d Boudin said .\nA spokesperson for the state attorney general \u2019 s office declined to comment on whether the practice purportedly used at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or federal laws , noting that the issue is being investigated by local authorities .\nSan Francisco Supervisor Hillary Ronen said she has already asked the city attorney to draft legislation explicitly outlawing the use of sexual assault survivors \u2019 DNA evidence for anything other than investigating their case .\nState Sen. Scott Wiener has also said he is exploring legislation to address the issue .\n\u201c Hopefully , in a few short months , there wo n't be any question about its legality , \u201d Ronen said at the news conference .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Maryland who specializes in genetic privacy and law enforcement \u2019 s use of DNA , told BuzzFeed News there has not been much litigation around the legality of unregulated databases like San Francisco \u2019 s , but in her eyes it should be illegal due to \u201c clearly demarcated limits \u201d in state and federal statutes about what DNA can be used for law enforcement \u2019 s investigative use .\nBut , she added , it could be difficult for people facing charges to learn about the existence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA match from a rogue database would be presented during prosecution .\n\u201c What would be introduced in court is the crime scene sample from the crime for which they \u2019 re charged \u2014 not the crime in which they were a victim \u2014 and another new , clean DNA sample that is collected following arrest or arraignment , \u201d Ram said .\n\u201c It can often be very difficult for a criminal defendant to learn about the investigative strategy of how they came under suspicion and so these sorts of investigative techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told reporters on Tuesday that the only reason his office learned about the crime lab \u2019 s storing of sexual assault survivors \u2019 DNA was because of a line on one page of discovery that made a reference to a 2016 sexual assault examination .\n\u201c The litigation process in this case is what revealed this transgression , \u201d he said .\n\u201c That doesn \u2019 t always happen.\n\u201d Rachel Marshall , a spokesperson for Boudin , did not respond to BuzzFeed News \u2019 questions about why the district attorney believed other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been holding on to sexual assault survivors \u2019 DNA when those labs say that \u2019 s not the case .\nInstead , Marshall emailed links to articles about how other agencies across the country have kept and searched DNA evidence of victims and other innocent people .\nWhen asked if Boudin misspoke about the scope of other California crime labs \u2019 internal databases , Marshall said she was \u201c not suggesting in any way that the DA misspoke.\n\u201d Sexual assault victim advocates and genetic experts told BuzzFeed News they have not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors \u2019 DNA to later incriminate them in unrelated crimes .\nThey cited other examples of rogue databases that have been used to collect genetic information from people who aren \u2019 t even suspected of committing crimes .\nStill , while they hope the practice reported in San Francisco is not widespread , advocates and experts said it shows that there needs to be more oversight of these unregulated databases to prevent the misuse of victims \u2019 DNA .\n\u201c There \u2019 s plenty of other ways to solve crimes , \u201d Katsanis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unethical applications of DNA data , we build distrust with the population .\nAnd that undermines the value of the tool .\n\u201d",

climate change .\nIn December , the New York City mayor signed a bill banning gas-powered stoves , furnaces , and hot water heaters in new buildings beginning in 2023 .\nOther cities in California and Washington have issued similar bans .\nThe potential impact of gas stoves on the climate is real .\nJust last month , Eric Lebel and colleagues at Stanford University published a study in the journal Environmental Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent greenhouse gas , leaks from gas stoves even while off .\nThe researchers visited 53 California homes and rental properties between January 2020 and May 2021 and tested 18 brands of gas cooktops ranging from 3 to 30 years old .\nThey estimate that the annual methane produced by US gas stoves has a climate impact equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from about half a million gas-powered cars .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that methane , although it lingers in the air for less time than carbon dioxide , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 times greater than its greenhouse gas cousin over a 20-year period .\nWhile gas stoves \u2019 effect on climate is the primary motivator behind much of the newer regulations and research , the pollutants the appliances release may affect your health , too .\nWhy are people concerned about gas stoves ?\nIn addition to methane , gas stoves emit carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxide , particulate matter , nitrogen dioxide , and formaldehyde ( a known carcinogen ) every time you bring those blue flames to life .\nA 2008 EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 50 % to more than 400 % higher average nitrogen dioxide concentrations than homes with electric stoves .\nWhether these toxic pollutants can hurt your lungs depends on the level and length of exposure , but they are more harmful for some people than others .\nNitrogen dioxide , in particular , has been linked to respiratory conditions , like asthma .\nA 2014 study used models to estimate that gas stoves expose about 12 million Californians to nitrogen dioxide levels and another 1.7 million to carbon monoxide levels that exceed ambient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a typical winter week .\nGenerally , \u201c any time there is ongoing exposure to something other than oxygen , \u201d your lungs will suffer , Dr. Jamie Garfield , an associate professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at the Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News .\nThe recent Stanford study also measured nitrogen dioxide levels .\nIn just a few minutes of cooking , people who didn \u2019 t use range hoods or had poor ventilation , especially in smaller kitchens , were exposed to nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s guidelines for one-hour outdoor exposure .\n( There are no regulations on indoor air pollution in the US . )\nThe amount of pollutants in the air may also depend on your gas stove \u2019 s cleanliness , general maintenance , and surrounding conditions , such as ventilation and kitchen size .\nHowever , the Stanford study found no relationship between the age and cost of a stove and its emissions .\nThe American Public Gas Association noted the Stanford study did not look at the type of food being cooked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect indoor air pollution levels , or compare gas to other types of stoves .\nBoth gas and electric stoves release emissions and \u201c federal agencies do not consider gas ranges to be a health hazard for consumers , \u201d it said in a statement .\nSome people face greater health risks from gas stoves than others The health risks from gas stoves can vary from person to person , according to Garfield .\nGenerally , healthy people , or those with larger or well-ventilated kitchens where gasses can dissipate , don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c To the individual sitting at that stove cooking dinner for their family , I do n't think there 's reason to be concerned , \u201d Garfield said .\nHowever , that may not be the case for people with respiratory illnesses or conditions , she said , such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\nCOPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is the fourth leading cause of death in the US .\n\u201c I would n't say that every respiratory disease or chronic illness is likely to worsen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , but certainly a disease that is related to the frequency and intensity of respiratory inhalant exposure will fare more poorly in this type of environment , \u201d Garfield said .\nThe risks may also be more pronounced in children , older adults , and people living in lower-income households .\nA meta-analysis of 41 studies published between 1977 and 2013 from across the globe found that children living in homes with gas stoves have a 32 % higher risk of asthma compared with children who do not live in homes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk was \u201c relatively small , \u201d the public health impact is \u201c considerable \u201d given the number of homes with gas stoves .\nOne group of people that hasn \u2019 t been studied as well is restaurant workers , who spend hours each day working in kitchens with the gas-powered appliances .\n( In fact , the new NYC regulation has an exemption for the use of gas stoves in commercial kitchens . )\n\u201c Our culinary population is in the trenches day in and day out for 10+ hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody has studied it as of yet , \u201d Chef Christopher Galarza , founder and culinary sustainability consultant for Forward Dining Solutions , a Pennsylvania-based business that helps other businesses switch to electric kitchen appliances , told BuzzFeed News in an email .\n\u201c When that time comes , we are going to be blown away by the data.\n\u201d Galarza said none of the chefs he \u2019 s worked with on the East Coast are mindful of indoor air quality in their workplace , partly because he , and likely others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas industry calling it \u2018 clean burning gas.\n\u2019 \u201d He noted there are no systems in place , other than range hoods above stove tops , to protect restaurant staff from constant exposure to gas stove fumes .\nBut executive chef Rachelle Boucher , an electric kitchen expert and owner of Kitchens to Life , said \u201c the tide is turning.\n\u201d \u201c Food service workers are beginning to question our old mindset of being tough , working through exhaustion and injury , and putting our health last , \u201d Boucher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do to lower exposure to gas stove pollutants There are steps you can take to lower your exposure and risks .\nBut for some people , like those living in lower-income housing , it may be harder to take appropriate or necessary action .\nLower-income homes are more likely to be located in areas with high levels of outdoor air pollution , which also increases asthma risks , and to have inadequate ventilation .\nA 2019 study found people living in low-income homes with good ventilation had better lung function than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , published in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology , included more than 250 children and adults living in Colorado .\nAlways turn exhaust fans or range hoods on while cooking ( even though they may be noisy ) .\nIt \u2019 s a simple and effective tactic , yet many people forget or choose not to do it .\nA 2010\u20132011 survey of more than 370 Californians found 40\u201360 % of respondents didn \u2019 t use their exhaust hood or open their windows while cooking .\nYou \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at least five minutes after cooking to collect any lingering pollutants .\nIf you can control it , try to ensure exhaust fans or range hoods vent to the outside ; although there are no federal regulations that require it , some states have their own laws in place .\nStill , there aren \u2019 t any standards to ensure venting is adequate , according to Brady Seals , a manager in the Carbon-Free Buildings program at RMI \u2014 a nonprofit that works on sustainability research \u2014 and coauthor of a 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas stove pollution and health .\nMeanwhile , other gas appliances like hot water heaters and furnaces are required to vent outside in some states .\nHere are some other ways to lower exposure to gas stove pollutants : \u2022 Open windows or doors while cooking ; just five minutes has a large impact , Seals said \u2022 Install low-level ( more sensitive ) carbon monoxide detectors in your home \u2022 When possible , cook on the back burners , which are closer to ventilation systems \u2022 Clean filters on your exhaust hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan , but only if it \u2019 s blowing air out an open window or door \u2022 Make sure your gas stove flame tip is blue ; a yellow-tipped flame indicates improper adjustment and increased pollution \u2022 You can keep children away from the kitchen while cooking to reduce health risks , but Seals said some studies have shown gas stove pollutants can make their way into kids \u2019 bedrooms Seals said you can buy a low-cost air quality monitor if you want , but keep in mind its sensitivity and accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the best .\nThose devices are better at detecting particles floating in the air .\nYou can also switch to an electric stove if you can .\nIf not , regularly maintain and clean your gas stove , and consider having a professional inspect all pipe connections to make sure there aren \u2019 t any leaks .\nSeals suggests using a plug-in induction cooktop or other electric appliances , such as kettles , toasters , microwaves , and instant pots , to reduce gas stove use .\nInduction cooktops use electromagnetic energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating the surface of the range .\n\u201c I 'm not telling anyone that they need to rip out their gas stove right now and replace it .\nBut when your gas stove dies or when it 's time for a new one , maybe consider electric or induction as an alternative , \u201d Seals said .\nHow do gas stoves compare with other health threats in your home ?\nBecause there isn \u2019 t \u201c a full national accounting of asthma triggers , \u201d Seals said it \u2019 s hard to compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other indoor pollutants , including paint products , cockroaches , candles , cleaning supplies , dust mites , pet dander , secondhand cigarette smoke , mold , and carpets .\nA 2017 report by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that gas stoves were the most commonly cited indoor environmental trigger of children \u2019 s asthma symptoms , slightly more than pet dander or having carpets or rugs in the bedroom .\nThe other main indoor asthma triggers were wood-burning fireplaces or stoves , pets in the bedroom , mice or rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report looked at survey data from 2006\u20132010 about triggers or exacerbation of symptoms in children already diagnosed with asthma . )\nTo reduce the risk of asthma and lung problems in general , you should routinely clean food crumbs from the floor , dust furniture , and have professionals check for more serious pollutants such as mold , radon , lead , and asbestos .\n\u201c There are a lot of things that we can do as individuals to reduce our exposure , but we need policymakers to [ step up ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are benefitting from some of it first , \u201d Seals said .\n\u201c There really has never been a more urgent time to address gas stove pollution for climate and for health than now

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former president Donald Trump on Friday lost his effort to get a set of lawsuits tossed out that seek to hold him responsible for the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 , with a judge rejecting Trump \u2019 s claims of absolute immunity and protection under the First Amendment .\nIn a 112-page opinion , US District Judge Amit Mehta found that it was \u201c plausible \u201d to allege that Trump would have known that his supporters \u2014 including members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys extremist groups named as his codefendants \u2014 were prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on Jan. 6 he delivered a \u201c call to action.\n\u201d Sitting presidents are generally immune from being sued for their official actions , the judge wrote , but Trump \u2019 s tweets urging his supporters to come to Washington to support his false claims of voter fraud , followed by his rally speech urging the crowd to \u201c fight \u201d and telling them to go to the Capitol , did not fall under that umbrella .\n\u201c Based on these allegations , it is reasonable to infer that before January 6th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of his words and that , when asked , some of his supporters would do as he wished .\nOn January 6th they did so , \u201d Mehta wrote .\n\u201c When he called on them to march to the Capitol , some responded , \u2018 Storm the Capitol.\n\u2019 Thousands marched down Pennsylvania Avenue as directed .\nAnd , when some were inside the Capitol , they told officers , \u2018 We were invited here by the President of the United States.\n\u2019 \u201d The ruling , which Trump is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits filed by Democrats in Congress and US Capitol Police officers that accuse Trump of conspiring to disrupt Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral College results and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power .\nThe judge denied motions to dismiss filed on behalf of the Oath Keepers and Enrique Tarrio , the leader of the Proud Boys .\nMehta separately is presiding over three criminal cases involving the Oath Keepers , including the first prosecution brought by the Justice Department in connection with Jan. 6 that charges defendants with seditious conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other codefendants fared better .\nLongtime Trump ally and occasional Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani also spoke at the rally before the attack on the Capitol , referencing \u201c trial by combat , \u201d but Mehta found that his comments couldn \u2019 t be interpreted as a \u201c call to action.\n\u201d The allegations were \u201c even thinner \u201d when it came to Trump \u2019 s eldest son , Donald Trump Jr. , Mehta concluded , finding that Trump Jr.s \u2019 \u201c false claims \u201d about election fraud and criticism of Republican officials who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all protected speech .\nMehta didn \u2019 t rule on a bid by Republican Rep. Mo Brooks to have the Justice Department step in to defend him in the case , instead providing Brooks with a roadmap to simply have the claims against him tossed out : The judge wrote that he believed Brooks would prevail for the same reason that he \u2019 d dismissed the claims against Giuliani and Trump Jr. Trump \u2019 s lead attorney Jesse Binnall did not immediately return a request for comment .\nJoseph Sellers , a lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress who are plaintiffs in one of the cases , said in a statement : \u201c This decision exhibits the finest tradition of our legal system \u2013 evaluating cases on their merits , not politics .\nWe will continue to pursue justice through the courts and ensure accountability for this attack on our democracy.\n\u201d Trump \u2019 s challenges to the lawsuits involved sweeping claims of absolute immunity and First Amendment protection as well as more specific arguments that the plaintiffs had failed to present enough facts at this early stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim that he \u2019 d been part of a conspiracy .\nMehta began with the immunity argument .\nHe largely rejected Trump \u2019 s arguments that he was shielded by absolute presidential immunity because his actions leading up to Jan. 6 \u2014 in particular , his tweets falsely claiming the election was stolen and calling his supporters to Washington \u2014 and during that day fell within his duties as a sitting president .\nMehta wrote that Trump and his attorneys had made a \u201c misleading \u201d and \u201c wrong \u201d argument that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution that empowers presidents to \u201c take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\n\u201d A president had no power over Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral College results or the vice president \u2019 s role in those proceedings as the president of the Senate , the judge wrote .\nTrump \u2019 s argument that he couldn \u2019 t be sued for anything he said related to Jan. 6 because he was speaking on \u201c matters of public concerns \u201d also failed , Mehta found .\nThe judge agreed that public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they said in their official roles , but that Trump \u2019 s \u201c proposed test \u2014 that whenever and wherever a President speaks on a matter of public concern he is immune from civil suit \u2014 goes too far.\n\u201d Mehta didn \u2019 t offer a blanket rule for when a president \u2019 s public comments would or would not be immune , writing instead that \u201c the context in which those words are spoken and what is said matter.\n\u201d The judge parsed whether Trump \u2019 s tweets and rally speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that they did not .\n\u201c After all , the President \u2019 s actions here do not relate to his duties of faithfully executing the laws , conducting foreign affairs , commanding the armed forces , or managing the Executive Branch .\nThey entirely concern his efforts to remain in office for a second term , \u201d Mehta wrote .\nMehta did dismiss a separate claim raised only in Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell \u2019 s lawsuit that sought to hold Trump liable for failing to use his power to immediately call off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf a president couldn \u2019 t be liable for their official duties , that same immunity had to extend to decisions not to use that authority , the judge held .\nMehta rejected Trump \u2019 s arguments that these cases involved a \u201c political question \u201d that courts couldn \u2019 t get involved in \u2014 the judge had already found Trump wasn \u2019 t carrying out official duties \u2014 and that the cases couldn \u2019 t go forward because they mirrored the charges that he \u2019 d been acquitted of in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year .\nThe next big question was whether the plaintiffs laid out enough facts and allegations to claim that Trump engaged in a conspiracy to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power .\nMehta found that they had .\nHe pointed out that a conspiracy , under the law , didn \u2019 t have to involve an \u201c express agreement \u201d \u2014 that is , there didn \u2019 t need to be evidence that Trump physically sat down with the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys and reached an agreement to storm the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to \u201c share the same general conspiratorial objective , \u201d the judge wrote .\nMehta wrote that there were \u201c multiple factors \u201d that made it possible for the plaintiffs to show that Trump was part of the conspiracy to disrupt Congress .\n\u201c [ I ] t is at least plausible to infer that , when he called on rally-goers to march to the Capitol , the President did so with the goal of disrupting lawmakers \u2019 efforts to certify the Electoral College votes .\nThe Oath Keepers , the Proud Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Capitol building plainly shared in that unlawful goal , \u201d Mehta wrote .\nMehta highlighted Trump \u2019 s public acknowledgment of the Proud Boys and wrote that it was likely that he knew about the Oath Keepers and that these groups , along with his other supporters , were \u201c prepared to partake in violence for him.\n\u201d He highlighted the intense engagement that Trump \u2019 s supporters had with his pre\u2013Jan .\n6 calls to come to Washington , the \u201c call-and-response \u201d element of the rally when Trump addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the collective \u201c we.\n\u201d \u201c The President and his advisors allegedly \u2018 actively monitored \u2019 websites where supporters made violent posts , and such posts were discussed on Fox News , a media outlet regularly viewed by the President .\nHe also would have known about violent threats made against state election officials , which he had refused to condemn .\nThe President thus plausibly would have known that a call for violence would be carried out by militia groups and other supporters , \u201d Mehta wrote .\nOnce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , Trump \u2019 s decision to continue to criticize then\u2013vice president Mike Pence via Twitter and to post a supportive message to \u201c great patriots \u201d later in the day could be seen as \u201c tacit agreement \u201d of the conspiracy .\nTrump \u2019 s argument that he was making \u201c political statements \u201d aimed at persuading other politicians \u201c misses the forest for the trees , \u201d Mehta wrote .\n\u201c For months , the President led his supporters to believe the election was stolen .\nWhen some of his supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to condemn them .\nRallies in Washington , D.C. , in November and December 2020 had turned violent , yet he invited his supporters to Washington , D.C. , on the day of the Certification .\nThey came by the thousands .\nAnd , following a 75-minute speech in which he blamed corrupt and weak politicians for the election loss , he called on them to march on the very place where Certification was taking place , \u201d Mehta wrote .\n\u201c The President \u2019 s narrow characterization of his conduct accounts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected Trump \u2019 s argument that his rally speech was protected under the First Amendment .\nMehta found that parts of the speech were \u201c plausibly words of incitement \u201d that weren \u2019 t entitled to constitutional protection , including : \u201c [ W ] e fight .\nWe fight like hell and if you don \u2019 t fight like hell , you \u2019 re not going to have a country anymore , \u201d and \u201c [ W ] e \u2019 re going to try to and give [ weak Republicans ] the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to take back our country \u201d right before he told his supporters to \u201c walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\u201d Referencing a 19th-century philosophical treatise , Mehta wrote that Trump \u2019 s speech was \u201c akin to telling an excited mob that corn-dealers starve the poor in front of the corn-dealer \u2019 s home.\n\u201d \u201c He invited his supporters to Washington , D.C. , after telling them for months that corrupt and spineless politicians were to blame for stealing an election from them ; retold that narrative when thousands of them assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to march on the Capitol building \u2014 the metaphorical corn-dealer \u2019 s house \u2014 where those very politicians were at work to certify an election that he had lost , \u201d the judge wrote .\nMehta wrote that some , but not all , of the other claims that the plaintiffs had raised under District of Columbia law , including negligence and aiding and abetting common assault , could go forward .\nHe dismissed an emotional distress claim raised by Swalwell .",

        "title": "The Founder Of The Oath Keepers Has Been Charged With Seditious Conspiracy",
        "content": "Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 others associated with the armed extremist group with seditious conspiracy , the first such charge to come out of the sprawling investigation of the Capitol insurrection since it began just over a year ago .\nRhodes , 56 , was arrested on Thursday shortly before noon local time in Little Elm , Texas , about 35 miles north of Dallas .\nA second man , Edward Vallejo , 63 , was arrested in Phoenix , according to the Department of Justice .\nThe other nine defendants have all previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case pending in Washington , DC , federal court .\nAccording to the indictment , which was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday and sealed until the following day , Rhodes conspired \u201c to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power \u201d by stopping Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 .\nHe and the other defendants , prosecutors claim , \u201c coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington , DC , equipped themselves with a variety of weapons , donned combat and tactical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodes \u2019 s call to take up arms at Rhodes \u2019 s direction.\n\u201d Attorney Jonathan Moseley , who represents another member of the Oath Keepers , said he was on the phone with Rhodes when the FBI called on the other line asking the group 's founder to come outside so he could be arrested .\nKellye SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 general counsel , said she is working to find a criminal defense attorney to represent Rhodes .\nShe called the arrest \u201c all part of the show \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire representation .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol , the acting US attorney in Washington , DC , at the time , Michael Sherwin , announced that a task force had been formed to explore more serious charges in connection with Jan. 6 , including seditious conspiracy .\nBut although more than 725 people have since been charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies for their involvement in the events of Jan. 6 , a number of whom are facing conspiracy charges related to obstructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral College , none has previously been charged with crimes related to sedition \u2014 which amounts to inciting a rebellion against the government .\nThe charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison .\nIt \u2019 s a rarely charged offense .\nFederal prosecutors last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment involving members of a militant group , and a judge ended up acquitting the defendants of the sedition count two years later .\nRhodes , whose first name is Elmer but who goes by his middle name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Known for the distinctive patch he wears to cover up an eye he lost from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound , he is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School who was later disbarred from practicing law .\nHe worked briefly for former member of Congress Ron Paul and rose to prominence as a frequent guest on Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars program , as well as for leading the Oath Keepers members into a series of charged political events , including the 2014 confrontation between cattle ranchers and federal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy standoff .\nRhodes , originally from Nevada , lived for years in Montana , but since separating from his wife in 2018 has lived an itinerant life .\nHe settled most recently in Granbury , Texas , where SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 attorney , is based .\nA longtime libertarian and critic of political figures on both sides of the aisle , Rhodes became more closely aligned with former president Donald Trump in the lead-up to and wake of the 2020 election , casting doubt on the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oath Keepers to attend protests and gather in Washington on Jan. 6 .\nThe original conspiracy case filed against members of the Oath Keepers in late January 2021 has grown to nearly two dozen defendants .\nIn the process , it has danced around Rhodes ' involvement in their activities , referring to him as `` Person One '' in court filings .\nNine of the 17 defendants in that case were also charged with seditious conspiracy in the new indictment .\nAccording to the 48-page , 17-count indictment , Rhodes began preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2020 , just two days after the presidential election , when he invited other Oath Keeper members to a leadership chat on the messaging platform Signal .\n\u201c We aren \u2019 t getting through this without a civil war , \u201d Rhodes wrote at the time .\n\u201c Too late for that .\nPrepare your mind , body , spirit.\n\u201d Over the following weeks and months , prosecutors allege , he employed increasingly fiery language to encourage the group 's members to prepare for conflict and , ultimately , to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloody and desperate fight , \u201d he wrote on Signal on Dec. 11 .\n\u201c We are going to have to fight .\nThat can \u2019 t be avoided.\n\u201d Between Dec. 30 and Jan. 2 , Rhodes bought some $ 12,000 worth of firearms and accessories , including a shotgun , night vision goggles , and large amounts of ammunition , the indictment alleges .\nOn Jan. 3 , he departed Granbury , Texas , for Washington , stopping twice en route to spend an additional $ 10,500 on an AR-15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other accessories .\nAnd in the two weeks after Jan. 6 , he spent an additional $ 17,500 on such items .\nIt \u2019 s not clear where Rhodes stored such items while in Washington .\nThe indictment details his work to help coordinate a so-called Quick Reaction Force , or QRF , composed of members of the Oath Keepers and associates from Florida , North Carolina , and Arizona who stowed their weapons in a Comfort Inn in Arlington , Virginia .\nOne of those individuals , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona and a self-described \u201c activist \u201d who served as an alternative delegate for the state \u2019 s Republican Party and attended the 2012 Republican National Convention .\nIn a message sent to another member of the Oath Keepers on Jan. 4 , he referred to the Comfort Inn as the \u201c allied encampment.\n\u201d Appearing on a podcast early on Jan. 6 , he discussed the possibility of \u201c guerilla war , \u201d noting \u201c there are people who are prepared , have the will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunt.\n\u201d Although Rhodes is not accused of entering the Capitol , prosecutors now say he entered \u201c restricted grounds \u201d on Jan. 6 by standing outside the building while it was being stormed , and they detail how he directed the movements of people who ended up penetrating the complex .\nAmid the chaos , Rhodes reacted to incoming messages that were claiming members of antifa were pushing past the Capitol Police .\nLater that night , the charging document claims , Rhodes joined several other members of the Oath Keepers celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant in Vienna , Virginia .\nAmid the festivities , he sent out an encrypted message : \u201c Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared to what \u2019 s coming.\n\u201d Given the encrypted nature of the Signal chats Rhodes engaged in , it \u2019 s not clear how prosecutors were able to gather their evidence .\nFederal agents seized Rhodes \u2019 phone last May , and he sat for an interview with the FBI in July .\nIn September , the government also used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s phone .\nThat warrant identified \u201c seditious conspiracy \u201d as a possible crime being investigated .\nMeanwhile , four other alleged members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department , presumably sharing their phones with investigators .\nAlthough little has been heard from those people , last month , prosecutors said they were continuing to help the government .\nThe new indictment effectively splits the Oath Keepers defendants into separate cases .\nThe original case , which charges conspiracy to interfere with Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is slimmed down to seven defendants .\nRhodes , meanwhile , faces the sedition-related charge , along with the other conspiracy count , alongside Kelly Meggs , Kenneth Harrelson , Jessica Watkins , Joshua James , Roberto Minuta , Joseph Hackett , David Moerschel , Brian Ulrich , and Thomas Caldwell .\nRhodes and seven of the other defendants were also charged with obstruction for deleting electronic records in the wake of Jan. 6 .\nProsecutors have also secured a separate new indictment against a previous Oath Keepers defendant , Jonathan Walden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and illegally being at the Capitol , but he does not face any conspiracy allegation .\nIt was not immediately clear what impact the new charges will have on the court \u2019 s schedule .\nShortly before the holidays , US District Judge Amit Mehta rejected efforts by the defendants in the Oath Keepers case to get the conspiracy charges tossed out .\nThe judge had planned to begin trial on one group of Oath Keepers in April , with a possible second trial in July .\nIt now seems likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at play .\nUnlike many of the charges brought against alleged Capitol rioters so far , which have focused on the physical criminal acts committed that day \u2014 such as assaulting police , disrupting Congress \u2019 s certification of the election results , and simply illegally being in the Capitol \u2014 sedition deals with a person \u2019 s intent to go against the US government .\nThe felony offense makes it a crime to \u201c conspire to overthrow , put down , or to destroy by force the Government of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to oppose by force the authority thereof , or by force to prevent , hinder , or delay the execution of any law of the United States , or by force to seize , take , or possess any property of the United States.\n\u201d In a public address last week marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack , Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled that people who hadn \u2019 t gone into the Capitol could still face prosecution for any involvement in the insurrection .\n\u201c The Justice Department remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any level , accountable under law , \u201d he said , \u201c whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.\n\u201d The Oath Keepers , along with the Proud Boys , have been a point of focus for the select congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 .\nIn November , the committee subpoenaed Rhodes to provide documents and a deposition , citing \u201c credible evidence of \u201d his involvement in the Capitol insurrection .\nAccording to Moseley , Rhodes was scheduled to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attorney represents Kelly Meggs , one of the other members of the Oath Keepers who is now indicted for seditious conspiracy , and had hoped Rhodes could be a witness for his client in the case .\nAt the time the FBI called on Thursday , Moseley and Rhodes were discussing whether the group leader would answer the committee \u2019 s questions or invoke the Fifth Amendment , the lawyer said .\nIt took a few minutes for Rhodes to go outside , he added , because he was not yet dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly relieved , \u201d said Tasha Adams , who filed for divorce from Rhodes in early 2018 , claiming that he had been physically and emotionally abusive to her and their children .\n\u201c I feel like I just set down a heavy weight that I have been carrying .\nThe weight of constant fear , of always looking over my shoulder to make sure my kids are safe .\n\u201d",

        "content": "\u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d In August 2021 , influencer Madison Vining made a big announcement on Instagram .\nAfter becoming one of the top sellers for the multilevel marketing essential oils company Young Living , she was quitting .\nTo her more than 250,000 followers on Instagram and her Young Living team , known as the \u201c Happy Oilers , \u201d the news came as a huge shock .\nYoung Living is one of two of the major essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorker reported in 2017 , along with its main rival DoTerra ( both claim to be the largest oils company in the world , according to the magazine ) .\nBoth reportedly reach $ 1 billion in sales annually and serve millions of customers .\nVining , who had worked for Young Living for more than eight years , had reached \u201c Royal Crown Diamond \u201d status ; sellers with that status make , on average , $ 1,645,692 annually or $ 137,000 a month , according to the company .\nPeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vining and her husband , Tyler , would leave so much money on the table to start from scratch .\nWhen , a few days later , the Vinings announced that they were joining a new wellness-focused MLM , Modere , which is best known for its collagen supplements , rumors swirled that the couple had gotten a huge payout or some other incentive to leave .\nFor months Vining had kept her reasons for leaving Young Living opaque .\nBut recently , she finally began to spill the tea on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave for leaving Young Living ?\nSatan and his demons .\nYes , the prince of darkness .\nVining is just one former top Young Living retailer who this month has either insinuated or flat-out said that they left the company after feeling , as devout Christians , that demonic forces were spreading \u201c darkness \u201d among Young Living members .\nOne former seller , Melissa Truitt , went as far as labeling the company a \u201c cult \u201d in an Instagram story highlight she posted to her account last week and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oily \u201c satanic panic \u201d by posting her series of Instagram stories last week accusing the company of spreading \u201c demonic \u201d propaganda through a New Age self-help book it sent to its members earlier this year .\nShe urged Christians still working for Young Living to flee or risk their souls .\n\u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d Truitt said in an emotional Instagram story .\nTruitt did not return a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not either , and shortly after I reached out , she blocked me on Instagram .\nIn response to the claims , Young Living said it \u201c did not publish and does not endorse this book in any way.\n\u201d In a statement , the company said that the book \u2019 s co-author , Marcella Vonn Harting , who is a top seller at the company , sent the book to \u201c her own list without the company \u2019 s knowledge or consent.\n\u201d The company denied providing Vonn Harting with anyone \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not return a request for comment ) .\n\u201c We support a culture of inclusion that we extend to our employees , customers , and brand partners world-wide , \u201d the statement read .\n\u201c We appreciate and celebrate our members and their diversity of background and belief , and are dedicated to ensuring our brand partners follow our policies and procedures and code of ethics.\n\u201d The influencers and former Young Living retailers \u2019 abrupt declarations that the company is satanic are odd to say the least , especially as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jumped ship to Modere over the past several months , before even receiving the book .\nTruitt , who had reached the second-highest \u201c Diamond \u201d status , also left Young Living five months ago to join Modere .\nAnd other big Young Living sellers slash influencers , like Liz Joy of Pure Joy Home and Monique McLean , abruptly announced they were switching to Modere recently as well .\nIn fact , so many prominent top Young Living sellers have been leaving that last August Young Living sued some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , for breach of contract .\nThe lawsuit , which was filed in federal court in Utah in August 2021 , was dismissed that December at the request of both sides .\nStill , it provides valuable insight into the breakup of the prominent Instagram essential oil sellers and the company .\nIn the complaint , Young Living accused the McLeans and the Vinings of working to cut a deal with Modere to \u201c raid \u201d Young Living \u2019 s business .\n( McLean did not return a request for comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for comment . )\n\u201c The named defendants in this case are former , extremely successful Young Living distributors who have meticulously executed a plan to leave Young Living , join a competing business venture , and take as many Young Living distributors and customers with them as possible , \u201d the lawsuit \u2019 s complaint read .\nYoung Living declined to comment on the lawsuit .\nBut now , the influencers are saying that money or alleged backdoor schemes had nothing to do with their decision to leave .\nVining wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the \u201c tip of the iceberg on this issue , \u201d and she feels better after \u201c denouncing this spiritual darkness \u201d to her followers .\n\u201c I feel a lot of clarity breaking my silence for things that matter in eternity , \u201d she wrote .\nThe denouncement of Young Living as demonic is especially intriguing because so many of its retailers , Vining included , have spent the past several years blending together the principles of alternative wellness and medicine the company espouses with their evangelical Christian beliefs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1993 by D. Gary Young , a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who successfully blended his own devout faith with a lifelong passion for alternative remedies .\nIn a newsletter to Young Living members after her husband \u2019 s death in 2018 , Gary \u2019 s wife , Mary , wrote that her husband \u2019 s desire to spread the gospel of essential oils was closely tied to his faith , writing , \u201c God was his foundation.\n\u201d \u201c He founded the essential oil movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never stopped in his desire to serve God \u2019 s children , \u201d Young wrote .\nFor many years , alternative remedies like essential oils were stereotyped to be the purview of hippie-dippie rich people , but , as Rachel Monroe wrote in the New Yorker in 2017 , essential oils have also caught on more broadly among women all over the US .\n\u201c Wellness is often dismissed as frivolity , another way for wealthy white women to spend money and obsess about their bodies , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find essential oils in a small-town drugstore in the Midwest as in an organic market in L.A. \u201d Over the past decade or so , many of the devotees who made it big in Young Living shared similarities with Vining .\nThey were young wives and mothers in the heartland who were devoted evangelical Christians , and they also seemed to have a suspicion of mainstream medicine .\nAccording to Vining , once she stopped buying mainstream medicinal and home products and dove into essential oils , her life changed dramatically .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family had decided to start a \u201c wellness journey \u201d three years before after learning about \u201c the dangers lurking in our home that were making us sick.\n\u201d \u201c There are ingredients in everyday things like baby lotion , dish soap , dryer sheets\u2026 all linked to cancer , infertility , and disease .\nWe just didn \u2019 t know , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c We slowly but surely took a trash bag through our home and began to read labels .\nInto the trash bag went candles , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was setting us or our kiddos up for failure with our health.\n\u201d Vining never specified what ingredients exactly were making her family sick but claimed that once she threw out the products she saw a huge difference .\nAnd once she found Young Living and began using oils , Vining claimed , her family no longer needed to rely on \u201c toxic \u201d Western medicine .\n\u201c We use essential oils for everything in our home , from seasonal irritations outdoors , to first aid type of things , to helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good stuff , and of course restful sleep !\n\u201d she wrote .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve blessed our family so so much.\n\u201d As the Vinings \u2019 platform grew ( in 2017 , Vining wrote she had 58,000 people under her in the business ) , the couple used the proceeds from their essential oil business to spread the gospel of Jesus , effectively combining the two parts of her life .\n\u201c Our prayer has always been that we would use our influence to point everything back to The One who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c We know that this money and this opportunity and this voice have not been given to us because of anything WE have done , and they are not ours.\n\u201d In 2017 , Vining and another Young Living seller made a goal to get Young Living oils into a school in Uganda that was founded by an American evangelical Christian missionary .\nThe Vinings and their partners were eventually able to raise enough funds to get oils and diffusers into every dorm room and classroom at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students \u201c appropriate wellness supplies to prevent icky diseases and unwellness , \u201d Vining wrote .\nShe felt that this plan was a calling from God .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about more than oils , you guys , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s ALWAYS been about so much more than oils .\nIt \u2019 s about \u2018 wellness , purpose , and abundance \u2019 ( YL \u2019 s slogan ) and it \u2019 s about using ANY platform we are given , to glorify the King.\n\u201d Vining \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career on social media , where she became a prominent Young Living influencer .\nAs her prominence within the \u201c oiler community \u201d grew , so did her online presence , and she went from having 56,000 Instagram followers in September 2018 to more than 200,000 when she quit the company in August 2021 .\nMany other Young Living sellers also found success on social media , where they were able to share their devout faith and their enviable lifestyles while also recruiting new downlines , or Young Living retailers who report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Crown Diamond who was sued by Young Living along with the Vinings last year , grew her platform to more than 29,000 Instagram followers and launched a book and video series called 24 Days of Prayer for Your Business .\nIn the series , McLean led followers virtually on a spiritual devotional aimed at centering their faith in their business ventures , Young Living or otherwise .\nTruitt , who has more than 43,000 Instagram followers , is also open about her Christian faith , often discussing her religion along with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellness , and fitness .\nIt is because these oil peddlers connected their spirituality so closely with their careers that their sudden insistence that the company is now somehow anti-Christian has been so jarring .\nBut according to the oilers , after years of success in Young Living they had begun to feel a darkness creep into the company and that \u2019 s what led them to leave .\nLast week , Truitt kicked off the public drama when she posted a series of Instagram stories about issues she had had with Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven good years of selling Young Living and reaching the second-highest Diamond status , she and her husband began to feel like the company was \u201c changing , \u201d and not for the better .\nTruitt didn \u2019 t specify what these changes were , saying they \u201c couldn \u2019 t really pinpoint it , \u201d but \u201c we heard things that didn \u2019 t really agree with our spirit.\n\u201d After praying about it , they decided to resign from Young Living at the end of 2021 .\n\u201c We knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , \u201d she said .\nTruitt said that , despite having resigned last fall , she received a \u201c demonic \u201d book in the mail earlier this month that she thought was sent from Young Living .\nShe said the company had sent it to all its Diamond-level sellers and claimed that Mary Young , the wife of the late founder , had encouraged the leaders to read the book and pass it along to their downlines .\nThe book , titled My Word Made Flesh , is cowritten by a self-help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a company called Mastery Systems ( Stevens did not return a request for comment ) .\nStevens describes himself on his website as a \u201c masterful facilitator of individuals and organizations that choose to transform their lives into healthy , creative , loving and fulfilling experiences.\n\u201d Stevens wrote the book with Vonn Harting , a Young Living Royal Crown Diamond who moonlights as a motivational speaker , and Young wrote the foreword .\nThe spokesperson for Young Living said Young \u2019 s choice to contribute to the book was separate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Young \u2019 s choice to write a foreword stemmed from her own belief about the use of language to promote positive outcomes and her desire to support a friend , \u201d they said .\n\u201c She wrote her foreword prior to much of the book even being written based on the authors \u2019 intent to teach people how to use positive language to help bring about change in their lives.\n\u201d I attempted to get a copy of My Word Made Flesh to see what it actually contained , but after placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mastery Systems \u2019 website , my order was canceled and refunded with no explanation .\nMy Word Made Flesh has now been scrubbed from the website .\nAccording to Truitt , when she received the book and flipped through it , she was horrified .\n\u201c This book is one of the most darkest and demonic books I \u2019 ve ever had in my house , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I can not wait to get rid of it but I had to share.\n\u201d In Truitt \u2019 s video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says is My Word Made Flesh .\nThe \u201c demonic \u201d elements of the book , Truitt claimed , include encouraging people to do basically a \u201c seance with oils \u201d and telling them to repeat \u201c I am the resurrection and the life of my lineage.\n\u201d In the Bible , Jesus calls himself \u201c the way , the truth and the life , \u201d and says \u201c no one comes to the Father [ God ] except through me.\n\u201d To Christians like Truitt , she explained , the book \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to imply you are supplanting Jesus \u2019 s spot .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing more false than that , \u201d she says in her Instagram story .\n\u201c Then taking Jesus out of it and putting yourself in there.\n\u201d Truitt warned \u201c believers \u201d who were still in Young Living that if they did what the company asked and brought the book into their household , \u201c it will completely ruin you.\n\u201d \u201c Leaders of Young Living , you received this book , and so if you are hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condoning this evil , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And if you promote it , you need a serious heart check.\n\u201d \u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And you have to stand up and rise up and run from this.\n\u201d Vining soon posted on her Instagram stories in support of Truitt , saying that she was proud of Truitt for sharing \u201c the truth.\n\u201d \u201c Believers be discerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy [ Satan ] prowls like a lion , and he can look ( and smell ) really good\u2026 this isn \u2019 t about a book .\nThough that book alone would have been a deal breaker for me\u2026 this is the tip of the iceberg on this issue.\n\u201d Vining added she was praying for clarity to speak out more about her experience with Young Living but knew she had to denounce this \u201c spiritual darkness.\n\u201d The reaction from Truitt \u2019 s community to her denouncement of Young Living was overwhelmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and for speaking out against \u201c evil.\n\u201d One woman wrote she had considered signing up for Young Living but would not after seeing Truitt \u2019 s stories .\nPeople also slammed Young Living on social media after Truitt spoke out , saying they were blending \u201c oils and the occult.\n\u201d \u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d wrote one .\nOther Instagram accounts , like Christian podcast host Blake Guichet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company is \u201c anti-Biblical.\n\u201d Guichet had previously posted \u201c deep dives \u201d into the supposed darkness in Young Living and said she wasn \u2019 t surprised to see Truitt \u2019 s stories .\n\u201c I knew Young Living was into some dark stuff , and everyone thought I was crazy , \u201d she said .\nSince posting about the book , Truitt has erased all mention of her claims from her account .\nShe continues to post memes about spiritual warfare , uploading a C.S .\nLewis quote that reads : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe .\nEvery square inch , every split second is claimed by God , and counterclaimed by Satan.\n\u201d Both Truitt and Vining are now preaching the benefits of their new company Modere , which you can swipe up on their accounts to buy , or even sell , products from if you choose .\n\u201c God did design our bodies to move , \u201d Truitt wrote on Instagram stories , adding , \u201c I have been using Modere products for a while and it \u2019 s just been so different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just flowing out of me.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Young Living \u2019 s social accounts have so far been silent on the controversy .\nThey continue to post about the benefits of oils , encouraging their 1 million followers to \u201c focus on you by taking some time out to practice mindfulness with your favorite essential oil blend.\n\u201d Their followers filled up their comments section with hearts .\n\u25cf",

living in the \u2018 most whatever \u2019 now , \u201d Wizner said .\n\u201c But in the 1860s , Americans killed 600,000 of each other .\nIn the Jim Crow era , thousands were lynched and hung from trees .\nThere was more political terrorism in the 1960s and \u2019 70s than in the last 10 years .\nSo I \u2019 m very skeptical of these \u2018 next civil war \u2019 thinkpieces that have been

executive director of Common Ground USA , a group focused on combating political violence , said she and her group are still urging people to be vigilant , especially when it comes to the increasing prevalence of extreme partisan rhetoric .\n\u201c There is that kind of hallmark characteristic of toxic polarization , where you see people say , \u2018 I wish they weren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d be better off without them , \u2019 \u201d Parker said .\n\u201c Those are the kind of psychological steps you need to take to commit violence against each other.\n\u201d This political demonization was exactly what the Times was seeking to condemn with its 2017 editorial , according to James Bennet , the former top opinion editor who inserted the language into Williamson \u2019 s draft over which Palin later sued .\nHe testified that while he deeply regretted his poor wording , he didn \u2019 t intend to say Palin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bennet argued , Palin was still connected to it through her rhetoric in the months before .\n\u201c It is political rhetoric that dramatically increases the heat of the political debate here , language in which we treat each other as enemies rather than political opponents \u2014 words like \u2018 traitor \u2019 and \u2018 evil \u2019 that have become fairly frequently used in our politics , and , by the way , in our media as well , \u201d Bennet testified .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s bad for our politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to get anything done or to compromise , which is a requirement of our system , and I worry there \u2019 s a great risk it can lead to violence.\n\u201d Common Ground USA would agree .\nIt makes no secret that it senses \u201c the early signs of danger \u201d in American democracy .\n\u201c We see in the United States a country that stands on the brink , \u201d the group \u2019 s website states .\nInherent in the concept of the brink , though , is the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c People often talk about having to hit rock bottom before you turn around , but rock bottom isn \u2019 t a physical place .\nBy definition , it \u2019 s the place you choose to turn around , \u201d Parker said .\n\u201c We are the authors of our future and we can choose our futures .\nBut we have to make the decision to turn around.\n\u201d For de-escalation to happen , Parker said , voters need to reward politicians who not only denounce violence but all toxic politics .",

to get in on trends without any real evidence or proof that they work .\nIf Emily Mariko says to stick an ice cube in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I \u2019 m doing it .\nIf Millie Leer vouches that bar soap is the best product to laminate my brows , I \u2019 m slathering it in on .\nAnd if every single person I see is wearing butt-lifting leggings that seem to make their rear look higher , firmer , and rounder than ever before , I \u2019 m buying them .\nWhen it came to the TikTok leggings , however , there were a few problems : 1 ) I am frugal by nature and refuse to spend money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) I kept seeing options that looked slightly different yet nobody was calling out brand names , and I had to know which pair was best , and 3 ) I needed to know if they could actually be worn during exercise .\nFor the sake of journalism , I decided to break my first rule and buy both the Amazon Seasum Butt Lift Tights and the Halara Butt Lifting Leggings ( which my research showed to be the two most popular leggings on TikTok ) .\nBefore we dive in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m more of a sweatpants-to-lounge , leggings-to-work-out kind of gal .\nI rarely wear leggings without at least the intention of exercising at some point in the day , so it \u2019 s important to me that they are comfortable , flattering , and functional , which are the three categories I used to evaluate the leggings popular on TikTok .\nYes , a flattering look is still important because most gyms and workout studios have mirrors , and seeing a reflection that makes me feel good can give me the confidence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in black .\nBlack and other similarly dark colors tend to be my default when it comes to leggings since I am a human who sweats when I work out .\nI prefer to not have that show through my pants , especially because that sweat generally comes through right around the crotch .\n( Although some high-quality colored leggings won \u2019 t show sweat either . )\nAs a 5-foot-6 woman , I \u2019 m slightly above average in height .\nI \u2019 ve been told that I have an athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , my butt is neither flat nor is it anything groundbreaking . )\nOverall I would call myself medium-size , but after looking at the sizing charts , reading some reviews , and knowing how I like my leggings to fit , I ordered a small in both pairs .\nYou can buy the Seasum High Waist Butt Lift Tights from Amazon for around $ 19 .\nYou can buy the In My Feels High Waisted Textured Butt Lifting 7/8 Leggings from Halara for around $ 28 .\nDo TikTok leggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that even Lizzo had gone with the Seasum butt-lifting leggings , I was understandably excited to try them out .\nI watched countless videos of people not only feeling themselves , but also filming the frankly shook reactions of their significant others upon seeing them in these leggings .\nSince most leggings I own already make my butt look decent ( if I do say so myself ) , I thought my life was about to be dramatically changed forever .\nI was wrong .\nUnfortunately , I give these a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my particular body .\nThey somehow flattened my butt while accentuating my hips and lower belly fat , which are two things I tend to want my leggings to flatten .\nI usually like a thicker waistband to compress that whole middle area and create more of an hourglass shape .\nThe Seasum butt-lift leggings did not do that for me , nor did they lift my butt .\nThey were also a bit long for my liking , basically meeting the tops of my ankle socks , which was surprising in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height .\nSome reviewers were on my side here : \u201c I was betrayed by a TikTok .\nThese make my butt look like a pancake and I actually have a butt so don \u2019 t be fooled by the TikTok .\nThese ain \u2019 t it hunny.\n\u201d \u2014Jord Others said that they can be super flattering on some bodies : \u201c So , uhh , yeah .\nIf you have a big butt and a smaller waist , get these pants .\nI \u2019 m 5 ' 9 '' and 230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XL fit perfectly .\nI haven \u2019 t taken a thot picture since my early 20 \u2019 s , but these pants looked so good there needed to be proof.\n\u201d \u2014Haley Havoc I found the Halara leggings to be slightly more flattering .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they did anything magical , they gave me a bit better shape in the waist through the hips .\nThey did not transform my butt , but they also didn \u2019 t flatten it .\nI preferred the length of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job of hiding any dimples in the skin .\nI \u2019 d give them a more medium-to-low score on the flatter meter .\nThe Amazon leggings were far superior to Halara when it came to comfort .\nThey had much more stretch despite the equally thick and bubbled texture .\nThe waistband , though not as wide as I \u2019 d like , did fit comfortably snug around my waist without causing too much fat to protrude over the top .\nA well-summarized review : \u201c The material is super soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe color is beautiful and they are so comfortable .\nThey are true to size as well which is nice .\nI have to say that at first , it felt like I had a wedgie all day because of the seam but I got used to it .\nAnd yes , it definitely accentuates your butt .\nI am very modest so I would not wear these out of the house but they are so comfortable I actually think I want to buy some more.\n\u201d \u2014Robyn I knew of Halara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupes for trendy workout wear like the Outdoor Voices Exercise Dress , so I thought they would make comfortable leggings .\nHowever , I found these leggings to be difficult to pull on , and they felt strangely stiff for a piece of apparel designed to move in .\nThe top band was thick and a bit more flexible than the legs without that honeycomb texture , though it still didn \u2019 t have enough elastic to hug me the way I \u2019 d like .\nCan you exercise in TikTok leggings ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Seasum leggings won out .\nHowever , it \u2019 s important to note that most reviewers , and even a fitness expert , agree that functionality isn \u2019 t their strong suit .\n\u201c Do I think those leggings are leggings that I would wear to work out in ?\nAbsolutely not , \u201d Laura Pachnos , a senior coach at Solidcore in New York City , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Do I think they \u2019 re going to make you look great ?\nAbsolutely.\n\u201d I gave mine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y7 Studio .\nWhile they were admittedly not my favorite leggings to exercise in , they held up fine through the yoga flow .\nSince I opted for black , you couldn \u2019 t see any of the sweat even after 60 minutes of moving in a 90-degree room .\nAccording to Pachnos , who has a dance background and is certified in a wide variety of group fitness classes , it \u2019 s best to choose leggings specifically geared toward the type of workout you \u2019 ll be doing .\nSome may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tighter , or more supportive .\nUnless you plan to wear them only when lounging or running errands , they should have sweat-wicking technology .\nThe Amazon Seasum leggings do not have this feature .\n\u201c If you sweat in them , depending on the color , it looks like you peed yourself and feels heavy afterward , \u201d she said .\n( In case you were wondering , her favorites for any type of workout are from Sweaty Betty , which also has leggings that offer bum-sculpting benefits . )\nNearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seasum butt-lift leggings isn \u2019 t ideal for strenuous workouts , making them far better suited for lounging than exercise , but they were still miles ahead of Halara as far as functionality goes .\nI put on my Halara butt-lifting leggings for a workout with my trainer and almost immediately took them off .\nAfter moving my legs around a fairly minimal amount , I felt like the seam in the crotch might burst , which would not be ideal while doing squats and bear crawls at the gym .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable working out in them .\nGiven that the Halara leggings are more expensive than the Seasum leggings you can buy on Amazon and are only moderately more flattering ( in my opinion ) , I would buy them only if you heavily prioritize the butt-lifting appearance over everything else .\nOtherwise , I \u2019 d say the Seasum leggings are the way to go .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they were particularly flattering for my body type , many reviewers and TikTokers with other body types disagreed .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of wearing them for exercise .\n\u201c They are made for lounging , \u201d Pachnos said .\n\u201c If you were going to pair them with a cute chunky sweater and some Converse to go out for your morning coffee , that \u2019 s when I \u2019 d wear those leggings .\n\u201d",

the attorney is identified using he/him pronouns , but their name is redacted throughout the report .\nThe attorney told one person in their office that they were thinking about signing the letter , but no one else , including Brady .\nThe letter to Barr wasn \u2019 t released to the public , but various news outlets reported on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspector general report , an official in the Executive Office for the United States Attorneys sent a message to the US attorneys whose staff had signed the letter , including Brady .\nThe message warned that the letter \u201c potentially triggered \u201d First Amendment speech protections and whistleblower protections and urged the US attorneys to \u201c take no action.\n\u201d Brady followed up by email the following day , writing that he had \u201c refrained from engaging \u201d and inquiring if it \u2019 d be OK if he asked the attorney in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow Barr \u2019 s directives and continue to serve as an election officer .\nA DOJ official ( the name is redacted ) replied that Brady could have a discussion with the attorney , but warned that removing them from the position \u201c could open you up to a retaliation claim.\n\u201d On Nov. 18 , Brady appeared at a press conference to talk about a case his office was handling related to the Clean Water Act .\nA reporter asked if his office was investigating voter fraud and about the Barr letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can \u2019 t comment on any existing investigations .\nTo the second , one of our two district election officers , who was married to the former chief of staff of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch , did sign on to that , unbeknownst to anyone in leadership before he signed on to that ; and did not talk about that with his fellow district election officer who \u2019 s also our ethics advisor.\n\u201d The assistant US attorney told the inspector general \u2019 s office they were \u201c shocked \u201d by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the reference to his spouse was \u201c inappropriate and retaliatory \u201d and was a \u201c public , partisan attack against a colleague and his family member.\n\u201d Brady didn \u2019 t reply .\nHe later told the inspector general \u2019 s office that he \u2019 d been trying to communicate that the letter wasn \u2019 t signed on behalf of his office .\nAsked if he could have done that without invoking the attorney \u2019 s spouse , he replied that he recognized \u201c I could have made that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant \u201c context \u2026 to allow the listener and the public to draw their own conclusions.\n\u201d The inspector general \u2019 s office found that \u201c Brady \u2019 s intentionally derogatory public remarks about an AUSA in his office sought to undermine the WDPA AUSA \u2019 s professional reputation ;

        "title": "The Deeper Questions Underlying The Sarah Palin Defamation Trial",
        "content": "When New York Times writer Elizabeth Williamson took the witness stand earlier this month as part of Sarah Palin \u2019 s failed defamation lawsuit against the newspaper , she testified that when she first began drafting the 2017 editorial that would become the center of the case , she wanted to address two themes : overheated political rhetoric in the US and the country \u2019 s easy access to guns .\n\u201c We need to take the tone down across the political spectrum and stop demonizing political opponents and stop using violent rhetoric and gun imagery to describe what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a veteran reporter who was then part of the Times editorial board .\nAs an example of someone working to restore political comity and civility , Williamson pointed to David Rubenstein , the billionaire private investment firm cofounder who has hosted regular bipartisan dinners so members of Congress can break bread with one another and , hopefully , see each other as human beings .\nThat immediately piqued the interest of US District Court Judge Jed Rakoff , who was presiding over the trial .\n\u201c Does he notify the fire department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On its surface , the Palin trial was about questions of law and fact .\nThe court had to decide whether the editorial defamed the former Alaska governor by falsely asserting a clear and direct link of \u201c incitement \u201d between her political action committee \u2019 s infamous map of crosshairs and the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords .\nDid the paper act with \u201c actual malice \u201d \u2014 the high standard required for libel of public figures like Palin \u2014 by publishing the claim when no link was ever established ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not .\nBut there were also deeper questions that bubbled up time and again during the seven days of evidence presented at the trial .\nWho , if anyone , bears responsibility for the actions of those who might be spurred to violence against representatives of Congress \u2014 or even the Capitol itself ?\nWas the Times editorial board , and the media at large , out of touch in its instinctive reliance on \u201c both sides \u201d political journalism ?\nAnd how did American politics become , as the editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWhile the jurors didn \u2019 t have to directly answer those grander questions , they did have to grapple with the media \u2019 s attempts to grapple with them .\nThe Palin trial was a rare instance in which the fiery political atmosphere the judge joked about came under the microscope in a courtroom .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a rare sight to see the rough and tumble of American politics being placed in front of a jury , \u201d said Ben Wizner , director of the ACLU \u2019 s Speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reason for that is the First Amendment is designed to give a huge amount of breathing room for politics , for rowdy politics , for exaggerated politics , for insulting politics.\n\u201d He added , \u201c The point is that political rhetoric should not come before a jury.\n\u201d It \u2019 s so rare for a jury to hear evidence of politics in a courtroom because public officials have to clear an exceedingly high bar to bring a libel case , said Leslie Levin , a University of Connecticut professor who studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not that common .\nReally , they don \u2019 t happen .\nIt \u2019 s so hard to get past the first motion to dismiss , and then summary judgment , that usually these cases are resolved at that point , \u201d Levin said .\n\u201c So those kinds of arguments , to a jury , at least , are really unusual because juries don \u2019 t really hear these cases.\n\u201d Another conservative politician seeking to sue media outlets , Devin Nunes , continues to run into hurdles .\nEarlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress turned Trump acolyte had a lawsuit against MSNBC returned to the same federal district in New York in which Palin sued .\nBut a federal judge there last year tossed out another libel lawsuit from Nunes against CNN .\nHe has also had lawsuits against the Washington Post and Twitter dismissed , but he continues to pursue several others .\nJurors may soon hear evidence of political speech ( and political lies ) in other cases .\nTwo voting machine companies , Dominion and Smartmatic , have launched a suite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Lindell who spread lies about them .\nBut those cases involve plaintiffs who argue they were nonpublic figures defamed by the powerful \u2014 not the other way around .\n\u201c What \u2019 s really strange is not that we don \u2019 t see more trials like [ the Palin trial ] , but that we saw one at all , \u201d Wizner said .\nGautam Hans , director of Vanderbilt Law \u2019 s Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic , said he suspected Palin , Nunes , and other conservatives were motivated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to have one ultimately land before the Supreme Court , where at least two conservative justices have shown a desire to revisit the actual malice standard set in the 1964 Supreme Court case involving the same newspaper , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan .\nHans compared these libel suits to other long-standing precedents suddenly up for reconsideration at a Supreme Court whose balance has shifted firmly to the right .\nSuddenly , he said , public officials with a grudge against the press don \u2019 t seem so hesitant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , abortion , the press \u2014 these are all examples of things that you might have thought , \u2018 Let \u2019 s be prudent and cautious , \u2019 but when you have the numbers [ on the Supreme Court ] , you don \u2019 t need to be prudent and cautious in the same way , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re a public official , what \u2019 s the point until now when you can sense more appetite on the court.\n\u201d But the political culture and rhetoric has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might help to explain why politics and the law are more often intersecting .\nHe speculated that , after four years of a president who regularly made it his mission to attack the media as \u201c the enemy of the people , \u201d these conservatives may be relishing the fight .\n\u201c In the past , if you were a public official , you probably didn \u2019 t want to be seen as going after people who were criticizing you , but all sorts of political norms are out the window , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the table are now on the table , and if you \u2019 re a public official , maybe it \u2019 s not so damaging to be suing the media.\n\u201d In finding itself in court , the Times was arguably a victim of the very overcharged political rhetoric it was seeking to condemn in the first place .\nAll of this played out in a wood-paneled courtroom in downtown Manhattan at a time when the temperature has arguably only risen since the map of crosshairs was first released more than 11 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high-profile incidents of deadly violence wrapped up in politics have become known by their respective shorthands : Charlottesville , Rittenhouse , Jan. 6 .\nTwo groups that tend to seek out political violence , antifa and the Proud Boys , are household names .\nSix men have been charged with plotting to kidnap the governor of Michigan .\nA Bernie Sanders supporter opened fire on Republican members of Congress playing baseball in Virginia \u2014 the incident that prompted the Times editorial over which Palin sued .\nThe rhetoric is uglier too .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress generated weeks of controversy by shouting \u201c You lie !\n\u201d at Barack Obama during his State of the Union address .\nNow , it \u2019 s not uncommon for Republicans seeking office to say Joe Biden stole an election or for public health officials seeking to save lives in a pandemic to be called Nazis .\nSchool board members need security escorts when they leave meetings .\nElection workers get death threats .\nA House Republican was censured by just two members of his own party for posting an anime video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is a QAnon supporter in Congress .\nMeanwhile , the number of Americans who believe it is justified to sometimes use violence against political enemies is in the millions .\nJohns Hopkins University political scientist Lilliana Mason told MSNBC last year that the manifestation of this violence may look different depending on a person \u2019 s party affiliation .\nFor the left , it might often mean property damage .\nFor the more armed right , it might mean something else .\n\u201c The place we \u2019 re in right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c because we have people like that guy at one of the town halls , saying , \u2018 When do we get to use the guns ?\n\u2019 That means they \u2019 re not shooting yet , but they \u2019 re ready.\n\u201d Not everyone is ringing the alarm bells .\nWizner , the ACLU lawyer , cautioned against assuming the country had reached some sort of new political extreme .\nPerhaps it just feels that way because we \u2019 re all more connected , and information \u2014 both the good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We all have a tendency to think we \u2019 re living in the \u2018 most whatever \u2019 now , \u201d Wizner said .\n\u201c But in the 1860s , Americans killed 600,000 of each other .\nIn the Jim Crow era , thousands were lynched and hung from trees .\nThere was more political terrorism in the 1960s and \u2019 70s than in the last 10 years .\nSo I \u2019 m very skeptical of these \u2018 next civil war \u2019 thinkpieces that have been coming out recently.\n\u201d He added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more time in front of computers now .\nFiring off a tweet is very different than firing off a weapon.\n\u201d Still , Nealin Parker , executive director of Common Ground USA , a group focused on combating political violence , said she and her group are still urging people to be vigilant , especially when it comes to the increasing prevalence of extreme partisan rhetoric .\n\u201c There is that kind of hallmark characteristic of toxic polarization , where you see people say , \u2018 I wish they weren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d be better off without them , \u2019 \u201d Parker said .\n\u201c Those are the kind of psychological steps you need to take to commit violence against each other.\n\u201d This political demonization was exactly what the Times was seeking to condemn with its 2017 editorial , according to James Bennet , the former top opinion editor who inserted the language into Williamson \u2019 s draft over which Palin later sued .\nHe testified that while he deeply regretted his poor wording , he didn \u2019 t intend to say Palin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bennet argued , Palin was still connected to it through her rhetoric in the months before .\n\u201c It is political rhetoric that dramatically increases the heat of the political debate here , language in which we treat each other as enemies rather than political opponents \u2014 words like \u2018 traitor \u2019 and \u2018 evil \u2019 that have become fairly frequently used in our politics , and , by the way , in our media as well , \u201d Bennet testified .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s bad for our politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to get anything done or to compromise , which is a requirement of our system , and I worry there \u2019 s a great risk it can lead to violence.\n\u201d Common Ground USA would agree .\nIt makes no secret that it senses \u201c the early signs of danger \u201d in American democracy .\n\u201c We see in the United States a country that stands on the brink , \u201d the group \u2019 s website states .\nInherent in the concept of the brink , though , is the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c People often talk about having to hit rock bottom before you turn around , but rock bottom isn \u2019 t a physical place .\nBy definition , it \u2019 s the place you choose to turn around , \u201d Parker said .\n\u201c We are the authors of our future and we can choose our futures .\nBut we have to make the decision to turn around.\n\u201d For de-escalation to happen , Parker said , voters need to reward politicians who not only denounce violence but all toxic politics .",

        "content": "Whether you know it or not , your home is filled with microscopic particles and other invisible pollutants that may affect your health to some degree .\nSoot from candles , fumes emitted by furniture , microfibers from laundry , and proteins shed by pets or pests can all irritate your lungs .\nEven the dust hiding under your bed can be filled with allergy-triggering mites .\nIn fact , exposure to pollutants is sometimes worse inside your home than out , which isn \u2019 t great considering the average American spends almost 90 % of their time inside .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution levels may be two to five , and sometimes more than 100 , times higher than those outside .\nOne of the most common sources of indoor air pollution might be sitting in your kitchen : a gas stove .\nThe natural gas it burns is made up primarily of methane ( 70\u201390 % ) , along with ethane , butane , and propane .\nWhen burned , the gas emits a cluster of byproducts , many of which can be harmful .\nMore than 40 million US homes contain the appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of precise heat control .\nHowever , gas stoves are also reentering the spotlight namely for their role in climate change .\nIn December , the New York City mayor signed a bill banning gas-powered stoves , furnaces , and hot water heaters in new buildings beginning in 2023 .\nOther cities in California and Washington have issued similar bans .\nThe potential impact of gas stoves on the climate is real .\nJust last month , Eric Lebel and colleagues at Stanford University published a study in the journal Environmental Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent greenhouse gas , leaks from gas stoves even while off .\nThe researchers visited 53 California homes and rental properties between January 2020 and May 2021 and tested 18 brands of gas cooktops ranging from 3 to 30 years old .\nThey estimate that the annual methane produced by US gas stoves has a climate impact equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from about half a million gas-powered cars .\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that methane , although it lingers in the air for less time than carbon dioxide , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 times greater than its greenhouse gas cousin over a 20-year period .\nWhile gas stoves \u2019 effect on climate is the primary motivator behind much of the newer regulations and research , the pollutants the appliances release may affect your health , too .\nWhy are people concerned about gas stoves ?\nIn addition to methane , gas stoves emit carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxide , particulate matter , nitrogen dioxide , and formaldehyde ( a known carcinogen ) every time you bring those blue flames to life .\nA 2008 EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 50 % to more than 400 % higher average nitrogen dioxide concentrations than homes with electric stoves .\nWhether these toxic pollutants can hurt your lungs depends on the level and length of exposure , but they are more harmful for some people than others .\nNitrogen dioxide , in particular , has been linked to respiratory conditions , like asthma .\nA 2014 study used models to estimate that gas stoves expose about 12 million Californians to nitrogen dioxide levels and another 1.7 million to carbon monoxide levels that exceed ambient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a typical winter week .\nGenerally , \u201c any time there is ongoing exposure to something other than oxygen , \u201d your lungs will suffer , Dr. Jamie Garfield , an associate professor of thoracic medicine and surgery at the Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine , told BuzzFeed News .\nThe recent Stanford study also measured nitrogen dioxide levels .\nIn just a few minutes of cooking , people who didn \u2019 t use range hoods or had poor ventilation , especially in smaller kitchens , were exposed to nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s guidelines for one-hour outdoor exposure .\n( There are no regulations on indoor air pollution in the US . )\nThe amount of pollutants in the air may also depend on your gas stove \u2019 s cleanliness , general maintenance , and surrounding conditions , such as ventilation and kitchen size .\nHowever , the Stanford study found no relationship between the age and cost of a stove and its emissions .\nThe American Public Gas Association noted the Stanford study did not look at the type of food being cooked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect indoor air pollution levels , or compare gas to other types of stoves .\nBoth gas and electric stoves release emissions and \u201c federal agencies do not consider gas ranges to be a health hazard for consumers , \u201d it said in a statement .\nSome people face greater health risks from gas stoves than others The health risks from gas stoves can vary from person to person , according to Garfield .\nGenerally , healthy people , or those with larger or well-ventilated kitchens where gasses can dissipate , don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c To the individual sitting at that stove cooking dinner for their family , I do n't think there 's reason to be concerned , \u201d Garfield said .\nHowever , that may not be the case for people with respiratory illnesses or conditions , she said , such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\nCOPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is the fourth leading cause of death in the US .\n\u201c I would n't say that every respiratory disease or chronic illness is likely to worsen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , but certainly a disease that is related to the frequency and intensity of respiratory inhalant exposure will fare more poorly in this type of environment , \u201d Garfield said .\nThe risks may also be more pronounced in children , older adults , and people living in lower-income households .\nA meta-analysis of 41 studies published between 1977 and 2013 from across the globe found that children living in homes with gas stoves have a 32 % higher risk of asthma compared with children who do not live in homes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk was \u201c relatively small , \u201d the public health impact is \u201c considerable \u201d given the number of homes with gas stoves .\nOne group of people that hasn \u2019 t been studied as well is restaurant workers , who spend hours each day working in kitchens with the gas-powered appliances .\n( In fact , the new NYC regulation has an exemption for the use of gas stoves in commercial kitchens . )\n\u201c Our culinary population is in the trenches day in and day out for 10+ hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody has studied it as of yet , \u201d Chef Christopher Galarza , founder and culinary sustainability consultant for Forward Dining Solutions , a Pennsylvania-based business that helps other businesses switch to electric kitchen appliances , told BuzzFeed News in an email .\n\u201c When that time comes , we are going to be blown away by the data.\n\u201d Galarza said none of the chefs he \u2019 s worked with on the East Coast are mindful of indoor air quality in their workplace , partly because he , and likely others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas industry calling it \u2018 clean burning gas.\n\u2019 \u201d He noted there are no systems in place , other than range hoods above stove tops , to protect restaurant staff from constant exposure to gas stove fumes .\nBut executive chef Rachelle Boucher , an electric kitchen expert and owner of Kitchens to Life , said \u201c the tide is turning.\n\u201d \u201c Food service workers are beginning to question our old mindset of being tough , working through exhaustion and injury , and putting our health last , \u201d Boucher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do to lower exposure to gas stove pollutants There are steps you can take to lower your exposure and risks .\nBut for some people , like those living in lower-income housing , it may be harder to take appropriate or necessary action .\nLower-income homes are more likely to be located in areas with high levels of outdoor air pollution , which also increases asthma risks , and to have inadequate ventilation .\nA 2019 study found people living in low-income homes with good ventilation had better lung function than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , published in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology , included more than 250 children and adults living in Colorado .\nAlways turn exhaust fans or range hoods on while cooking ( even though they may be noisy ) .\nIt \u2019 s a simple and effective tactic , yet many people forget or choose not to do it .\nA 2010\u20132011 survey of more than 370 Californians found 40\u201360 % of respondents didn \u2019 t use their exhaust hood or open their windows while cooking .\nYou \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at least five minutes after cooking to collect any lingering pollutants .\nIf you can control it , try to ensure exhaust fans or range hoods vent to the outside ; although there are no federal regulations that require it , some states have their own laws in place .\nStill , there aren \u2019 t any standards to ensure venting is adequate , according to Brady Seals , a manager in the Carbon-Free Buildings program at RMI \u2014 a nonprofit that works on sustainability research \u2014 and coauthor of a 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas stove pollution and health .\nMeanwhile , other gas appliances like hot water heaters and furnaces are required to vent outside in some states .\nHere are some other ways to lower exposure to gas stove pollutants : \u2022 Open windows or doors while cooking ; just five minutes has a large impact , Seals said \u2022 Install low-level ( more sensitive ) carbon monoxide detectors in your home \u2022 When possible , cook on the back burners , which are closer to ventilation systems \u2022 Clean filters on your exhaust hoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan , but only if it \u2019

air quality monitor if you want , but keep in mind its sensitivity and accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the best .\nThose devices are better at detecting particles floating in the air .\nYou can also switch to an electric stove if you can .\nIf not , regularly maintain and clean your gas stove , and consider having a professional inspect all pipe connections to make sure there aren \u2019 t any leaks .\nSeals suggests using a plug-in induction cooktop or other electric appliances , such as kettles , toasters , microwaves , and instant pots , to reduce gas stove use .\nInduction cooktops use electromagnetic energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating the surface of the range .\n\u201c I 'm not telling anyone that they need to rip out their gas stove right now and replace it .\nBut when your gas stove

candles , cleaning supplies , dust mites , pet dander , secondhand cigarette smoke , mold , and carpets .\nA 2017 report by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that gas stoves were the most commonly cited indoor environmental trigger of children \u2019 s asthma symptoms , slightly more than pet dander or having carpets or rugs in the bedroom .\nThe other main indoor asthma triggers were wood-burning fireplaces or stoves , pets in the bedroom , mice or rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The report looked at survey data from 2006\u20132010 about triggers or exacerbation of symptoms in children already diagnosed with asthma . )\nTo reduce the risk of asthma and lung problems in general , you should routinely clean food crumbs from the floor , dust furniture , and have professionals check for more serious pollutants such as mold , radon , lead , and asbestos .\n\u201c There are a lot of things that we can do as individuals to reduce our exposure , but we need policymakers to [ step up ] @

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nTikTok has a way of making you want to get in on trends without any real evidence or proof that they work .\nIf Emily Mariko says to stick an ice cube in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I \u2019 m doing it .\nIf Millie Leer vouches that bar soap is the best product to laminate my brows , I \u2019 m slathering it in on .\nAnd if every single person I see is wearing butt-lifting leggings that seem to make their rear look higher , firmer , and rounder than ever before , I \u2019 m buying them .\nWhen it came to the TikTok leggings , however , there were a few problems : 1 ) I am frugal by nature and refuse to spend money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) I kept seeing options that looked slightly different yet nobody was calling out brand names , and I had to know which pair was best , and 3 ) I needed to know if they could actually be worn during exercise .\nFor the sake of journalism , I decided to break my first rule and buy both the Amazon Seasum Butt Lift Tights and the Halara Butt Lifting Leggings ( which my research showed to be the two most popular leggings on TikTok ) .\nBefore we dive in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m more of a sweatpants-to-lounge , leggings-to-work-out kind of gal .\nI rarely wear leggings without at least the intention of exercising at some point in the day , so it \u2019 s important to me that they are comfortable , flattering , and functional , which are the three categories I used to evaluate the leggings popular on TikTok .\nYes , a flattering look is still important because most gyms and workout studios have mirrors , and seeing a reflection that makes me feel good can give me the confidence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in black .\nBlack and other similarly dark colors tend to be my default when it comes to leggings since I am a human who sweats when I work out .\nI prefer to not have that show through my pants , especially because that sweat generally comes through right around the crotch .\n( Although some high-quality colored leggings won \u2019 t show sweat either . )\nAs a 5-foot-6 woman , I \u2019 m slightly above average in height .\nI \u2019 ve been told that I have an athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , my butt is neither flat nor is it anything groundbreaking . )\nOverall I would call myself medium-size , but after looking at the sizing charts , reading some reviews , and knowing how I like my leggings to fit , I ordered a small in both pairs .\nYou can buy the Seasum High Waist Butt Lift Tights from Amazon for around $ 19 .\nYou can buy the In My Feels High Waisted Textured Butt Lifting 7/8 Leggings from Halara for around $ 28 .\nDo TikTok leggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that even Lizzo had gone with the Seasum butt-lifting leggings , I was understandably excited to try them out .\nI watched countless videos of people not only feeling themselves , but also filming the frankly shook reactions of their significant others upon seeing them in these leggings .\nSince most leggings I own already make my butt look decent ( if I do say so myself ) , I thought my life was about to be dramatically changed forever .\nI was wrong .\nUnfortunately , I give these a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my particular body .\nThey somehow flattened my butt while accentuating my hips and lower belly fat , which are two things I tend to want my leggings to flatten .\nI usually like a thicker waistband to compress that whole middle area and create more of an hourglass shape .\nThe Seasum butt-lift leggings did not do that for me , nor did they lift my butt .\nThey were also a bit long for my liking , basically meeting the tops of my ankle socks , which was surprising in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height .\nSome reviewers were on my side here : \u201c I was betrayed by a TikTok .\nThese make my butt look like a pancake and I actually have a butt so don \u2019 t be fooled by the TikTok .\nThese ain \u2019 t it hunny.\n\u201d \u2014Jord Others said that they can be super flattering on some bodies : \u201c So , uhh , yeah .\nIf you have a big butt and a smaller waist , get these pants .\nI \u2019 m 5 ' 9 '' and 230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XL fit perfectly .\nI haven \u2019 t taken a thot picture since my early 20 \u2019 s , but these pants looked so good there needed to be proof.\n\u201d \u2014Haley Havoc I found the Halara leggings to be slightly more flattering .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they did anything magical , they gave me a bit better shape in the waist through the hips .\nThey did not transform my butt , but they also didn \u2019 t flatten it .\nI preferred the length of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job of hiding any dimples in the skin .\nI \u2019 d give them a more medium-to-low score on the flatter meter .\nThe Amazon leggings were far superior to Halara when it came to comfort .\nThey had much more stretch despite the equally thick and bubbled texture .\nThe waistband , though not as wide as I \u2019 d like , did fit comfortably snug around my waist without causing too much fat to protrude over the top .\nA well-summarized review : \u201c The material is super soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe color is beautiful and they are so comfortable .\nThey are true to size as well which is nice .\nI have to say that at first , it felt like I had a wedgie all day because of the seam but I got used to it .\nAnd yes , it definitely accentuates your butt .\nI am very modest so I would not wear these out of the house but they are so comfortable I actually think I want to buy some more.\n\u201d \u2014Robyn I knew of Halara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupes for trendy workout wear like the Outdoor Voices Exercise Dress , so I thought they would make comfortable leggings .\nHowever , I found these leggings to be difficult to pull on , and they felt strangely stiff for a piece of apparel designed to move in .\nThe top band was thick and a bit more flexible than the legs without that honeycomb texture , though it still didn \u2019 t have enough elastic to hug me the way I \u2019 d like .\nCan you exercise in TikTok leggings ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Seasum leggings won out .\nHowever , it \u2019 s important to note that most reviewers , and even a fitness expert , agree that functionality isn \u2019 t their strong suit .\n\u201c Do I think those leggings are leggings that I would wear to work out in ?\nAbsolutely not , \u201d Laura Pachnos , a senior coach at Solidcore in New York City , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Do I think they \u2019 re going to make you look great ?\nAbsolutely.\n\u201d I gave mine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y7 Studio .\nWhile they were admittedly not my favorite leggings to exercise in , they held up fine through the yoga flow .\nSince I opted for black , you couldn \u2019 t see any of the sweat even after 60 minutes of moving in a 90-degree room .\nAccording to Pachnos , who has a dance background and is certified in a wide variety of group fitness classes , it \u2019 s best to choose leggings specifically geared toward the type of workout you \u2019 ll be doing .\nSome may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tighter , or more supportive .\nUnless you plan to wear them only when lounging or running errands , they should have sweat-wicking technology .\nThe Amazon Seasum leggings do not have this feature .\n\u201c If you sweat in them , depending on the color , it looks like you peed yourself and feels heavy afterward , \u201d she said .\n( In case you were wondering , her favorites for any type of workout are from Sweaty Betty , which also has leggings that offer bum-sculpting benefits . )\nNearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seasum butt-lift leggings isn \u2019 t ideal for strenuous workouts , making them far better suited for lounging than exercise , but they were still miles ahead of Halara as far as functionality goes .\nI put on my Halara butt-lifting leggings for a workout with my trainer and almost immediately took them off .\nAfter moving my legs around a fairly minimal amount , I felt like the seam in the crotch might burst , which would not be ideal while doing squats and bear crawls at the gym .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable working out in them .\nGiven that the Halara leggings are more expensive than the Seasum leggings you can buy on Amazon and are only moderately more flattering ( in my opinion ) , I would buy them only if you heavily prioritize the butt-lifting appearance over everything else .\nOtherwise , I \u2019 d say the Seasum leggings are the way to go .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they were particularly flattering for my body type , many reviewers and TikTokers with other body types disagreed .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of wearing them for exercise .\n\u201c They are made for lounging , \u201d Pachnos said .\n\u201c If you were going to pair them with a cute chunky sweater and some Converse to go out for your morning coffee , that \u2019 s when I \u2019 d wear those leggings .\n\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There was a burst of energy in the Senate last month to block future attempts to overturn electoral college votes and steal a presidential election .\nBut that momentum has stalled and no bill is expected anytime soon .\nA bipartisan group of senators has been negotiating how to prevent a vice president from overturning election results during the electoral college count .\nFormer president Donald Trump and his allies hoped to exploit legal ambiguities in January 2021 to overturn his loss to Joe Biden .\nThat plan ultimately went nowhere as then\u2013vice president Mike Pence and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plot .\nAfter the Democrats failed to get enough votes to pass their voting rights bill last month , talks quickly began on a bipartisan bill to fix the process of certifying elections .\nBut early enthusiasm around finding bipartisan agreement to change election laws has now settled into a long slog of figuring out how to actually do it .\nThe timeline is now being talked about in terms of months or even years .\n\u201c Oh , it \u2019 s a long way to go , \u201d said Sen. Mitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c But it doesn \u2019 t get called into question until 2024 so we have plenty of time to work on it.\n\u201d Bipartisan efforts often collapse because of politics , but both sides are indicating that is not the case here .\nThe will is there , they say .\nThe problem is how complicated the issue is .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve still got a lot of research to do .\nIt \u2019 s a lot of work .\nWe \u2019 re meeting regularly , we \u2019 re talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut it \u2019 s a ways to go , \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins , who is leading the Republican side .\nSenators are looking to amend the Electoral Count Act , a 135-year-old arcane and often confusing document that lays out how election disputes are settled .\nThe law states that the sitting vice president will preside over the Senate when it counts electoral college votes on Jan. 6 .\nTraditionally , this role has been ceremonial .\nBut Trump argued \u2014 and continues to argue \u2014 that the vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reject electors sent by the states .\nThere seems to be clearly enough support across both parties to amend the law to clarify that the vice president \u2019 s role is only symbolic .\nEven Sen. Ron Johnson , a Republican who frequently repeated unverified claims about voter fraud , told BuzzFeed News he supports such a measure .\nThe problem is what else gets included .\nPoliticians are trying to balance the powers , responsibilities , and limitations of three separate entities in a way that will avoid a constitutional crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the states , which are in charge of running elections , certifying the results , and sending slates of electors to Congress .\nThese electors , making up the electoral college , ultimately select the next president .\nYou have Congress , whose role is to certify and count those electors .\nThen you have the courts , which have been regularly brought in to moderate disputes in recent history , but which could be overruled by Congress .\nLet \u2019 s say a state elects one party locally , but votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a presidential election .\nWhat happens if the state government overturns those results , citing \u201c fraud \u201d or \u201c irregularities , \u201d and sends a slate of electors that supports their candidate ?\nCan Congress overrule a state legislature ?\n\u201c It depends , \u201d said Republican Sen. Todd Young , one senator involved in talks .\nAppearing to realize this wasn \u2019 t the most reassuring answer , Young added , \u201c Sorry , but it \u2019 s true , though.\n\u201d Trump has spent the last weeks railing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any Republican supportive of the process .\n\u201c The reason they want it changed is because they now say they don \u2019 t want the Vice President to have the right to ensure an honest vote , \u201d he said in a statement on Feb. 4 .\n\u201c In other words , I was right and everyone knows it.\n\u201d Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said that the reform bill , whenever it gets written , is expected to go through regular order .\nThat means going before the Senate Rules Committee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo one involved is giving a timeline for when even the first stage could be complete .\n\u201c A lot of discussion , research going on , \u201d said Angus King , the lead Democrat on the bipartisan talks .",

        "content": "James Bennet , the former top editor of the New York Times \u2019 opinion section , began testifying Tuesday about how he came to insert a line into an editorial that falsely suggested a connection between a deadly shooting and the political action committee of Sarah Palin \u2014 a line which prompted the former Alaska governor to sue the newspaper for libel .\nSpeaking before a judge and jury in a federal courtroom in downtown Manhattan , Bennet took responsibility for the erroneous language , but explained how he had been working against a tight print deadline .\nHe also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check in great detail the revisions he had made when he sent her back the revised draft , known as a \u201c playback.\n\u201d \u201c This is my fault .\nI wrote those sentences , and I 'm not looking to shift the blame to anyone else , \u201d Bennet told the court , before adding , \u201c But this is why we send playbacks to writers .\nThey \u2019 re the ones who reported the story , reviewed the facts.\n\u201d Bennet , who had previously been editor-in-chief of the Atlantic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American media thanks to his prestigious role at the top of the Times ' opinion section .\nBut he resigned from his job in June 2020 amid controversy over the publication of an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton which called for the military to be deployed against anti\u2013police brutality protesters .\nBennet admitted he did not personally read the Cotton piece before it was published , and the Times said it fell short of their standards .\nBennet described to the court how on June 14 , 2017 , he had performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first draft of editorial board writer Elizabeth Williamson , who had been tasked with writing an editorial in response to the shooting attack on Republican members of Congress at a Virginia baseball field earlier that day .\nThe piece , titled \u201c America \u2019 s Lethal Politics , \u201d had compared that shooting , which seriously injured Rep. Steve Scalise , to the 2011 attack in Arizona that wounded then-representative Gabby Giffords and killed six others .\n\u201c The link to political incitement was clear , \u201d read the language Bennet added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting and a 2010 map produced by Palin \u2019 s PAC that featured gun crosshairs over the districts of vulnerable Democrats in Congress , including Giffords \u2019 .\nIn fact , there was no established link between that map and the gunman in the Giffords shooting , who had a mental illness .\nBennet described how hours after the piece was first published online he received an email late that night from Times columnist Ross Douthat , complaining about the false link between the Palin PAC and the 2011 shooting .\nBennet said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something unintended , but he then checked Twitter and observed others making the same criticism .\n\u201c That is not the message we intended to send , \u201d Bennet said .\nPalin attorney Shane Vogt asked Bennet why he didn \u2019 t immediately move to unpublish the piece , but Bennet said the newspaper has a policy against removing stories and that it had already been sent to the printers for the next day \u2019 s hard copy .\nInstead , Bennet testified , he emailed Williamson and a fact-checker around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researching the Arizona gunman \u2019 s motives and whether the map was involved in any way , so they could begin the process of correcting the piece if needed .\n\u201c We were really scrambling to try to address this , \u201d Bennet told the court .\nThe evidence previously shown to the jury included messages between Bennet and Williamson in which she apologized to him and wrote she \u201c should have read those [ paragraphs he had written ] more closely and asked more questions.\n\u201d \u201c No worries .\nI feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote .\n\u201c I just moved too fast .\nI \u2019 m sorry.\n\u201d He also responded again to Douthat via email , telling the columnist he felt \u201c lousy \u201d about the error , which he wrote \u201c reads like partisan scorekeeping.\n\u201d Under the law , for Palin to succeed in her case she must prove that Bennet and the newspaper acted with \u201c actual malice , \u201d meaning he acted either with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the statement \u2019 s falsity .\nGabe Rottman , the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , told BuzzFeed News that the so-called actual malice rule takes into consideration the idea that reporters may occasionally make unintentional mistakes when working against a deadline .\n`` I think the key thing is understanding the nature of news .\nIt \u2019 s a competitive business and competitiveness is actually good for public discourse , '' Rottman said .\n`` The free flow of information quickly is important for an informed electorate . ''\n`` If it were possible for an honest reporter who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit every time they do , then that will chill reporting .\nIt will mean fewer stories and less investigative journalism , '' Rottman said .\n`` That \u2019 s why the actual malice rule is there .

for the government \u2019 s environmental justice work , pointing specifically to the creation of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory and Interagency councils .\nAnd , of course , the Justice40 program launched .\n\u201c Equity , \u201d Mallory said , is now central to any federal program that touches on climate change .\nThe question now is how to fully implement that concept .\nThis is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out .\nTo that end , the White House last July released interim guidance on how federal agencies should think about the 40 % goal and identify programs that would be impacted .\nMost , if not all , federal agencies delivered an update on this in December , according to Mallory .\n\u201c And so all of that sets us up for 2022 , \u201d Mallory said .\nPerhaps the first step will be the release of the administration \u2019 s environmental justice scorecard , a tool for helping track the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration initially said the scorecard would be released this February .\nBut that may not happen , Mallory acknowledged .\n\u201c I think our main aim for that is definitely the first quarter , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I won \u2019 t swear to

expanding its staff working specifically on environmental justice .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a need to make sure that those positions are filled as quickly as possible with qualified individuals , and to expand out additional folks who are needed , \u201d he said .\nMallory , though , did not bat away complaints from activists who are frustrated by her office \u2019 s speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also would

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The US Supreme Court on Wednesday denied former president Donald Trump \u2019 s effort to stop the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection from getting nearly 800 pages of White House records he \u2019 d tried to claim were protected by executive privilege .\nA majority of justices refused to intervene and disturb lower court decisions that had cleared the way for the National Archives to turn over the collection of contested documents to the committee .\nOnly Justice Clarence Thomas noted a dissent from the court \u2019 s decision , indicating he would have granted Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking the committee from getting the documents as the legal fight went forward .\nThe only thing stopping the Archives from turning over the documents to the committee at this point was a temporary order from a federal appeals court from December that had kept the documents in limbo while Trump tried to convince the justices to step in .\nThat lower court injunction was set to expire once the Supreme Court ruled on Trump \u2019 s latest motion .\nThe Trump-era White House records at issue include presidential diaries , schedules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speeches and correspondence , proposed talking points , \u201c a draft Executive Order on the topic of election integrity , \u201d a memo about potential legal action the federal government could take to challenge President Joe Biden \u2019 s wins in key states ( the Justice Department filed no such case ) , and an email chain that involved a state official \u201c regarding election-related issues , \u201d according to descriptions of the documents submitted as part of the legal fight .\nJust over two hours after the Supreme Court released its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Republican vice chair Liz Cheney put out a joint statement appearing to confirm that they 'd already started receiving documents .\n`` The Supreme Court \u2019 s action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy , '' Thompson and Cheney said .\n`` The Select Committee has already begun to receive records that the former President had hoped to keep hidden and we look forward to additional productions regarding this important information .\nOur work goes forward to uncover all the facts about the violence of January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents can try to assert executive privilege over their archived White House records , but the incumbent has to back that claim for it to have legal effect .\nBiden refused to do so when Trump claimed the privilege in response to the committee \u2019 s requests to the Archives .\nAt each stage of the fight in the lower courts , judges were skeptical of Trump \u2019 s argument that former officeholders should have broad discretion to take a sitting president to court to challenge their refusal to invoke executive privilege on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill the committee \u2019 s request for White House records leading up to the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 insurrection as well as the period immediately after , the national archivist identified sets of records on a rolling basis in what are referred to as tranches .\nThe fight in the district court and the DC Circuit had focused on the first three tranches .\nTrump didn \u2019 t object to all of the documents going to the committee \u2014 some have already been turned over \u2014 but claimed 763 pages from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielded by executive privilege .\nThe Archives was also poised on Wednesday to produce another four pages from an additional tranche over Trump \u2019 s objection ; the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision clears the path for those documents to go to the committee as well .\nTrump lost twice in the lower courts in his bid to stop the Jan. 6 committee from getting various categories of his White House records that he maintained should be protected by executive privilege .\nOn Nov. 9 , a federal district judge in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an injunction that would stop the National Archives from turning over the documents .\nA month later , the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit again sided against Trump , upholding the district court \u2019 s decision in a 3\u20130 order .\n\u201c On the record before us , former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden \u2019 s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the Political Branches over these documents , \u201d DC Circuit Judge Patricia Millett wrote for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a unique legislative need for these documents and that they are directly relevant to the Committee \u2019 s inquiry into an attack on the Legislative Branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power.\n\u201d The Supreme Court \u2019 s Wednesday order stated that because the DC Circuit had concluded that Trump \u2019 s legal challenge would fail regardless of his status as a former president , anything that the appeals court had to say about when a former president could sue over executive privilege wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump \u2019 s case presented \u201c are unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns , \u201d the majority wrote ; the order wasn \u2019 t signed by any specific justice .\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately to say that he believed there had to be circumstances where a former president could successfully invoke privilege over their administration records even if the incumbent refused to back it .\n\u201c Concluding otherwise , \u201d Kavanaugh wrote , \u201c would eviscerate the executive privilege for Presidential communications.\n\u201d Although Trump repeatedly lost the legal arguments his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he succeeded in delaying the committee from getting his records .\nThe Archives were originally set to begin turning over documents on Nov. 12 , 2021 .\nTrump filed suit in mid-October , and while he appealed his loss in the district court , the DC Circuit agreed to temporarily block the Archives from taking action .\nThe panel then gave Trump another 14 days to petition the Supreme Court to step in , and once he did that , it extended the pause even further until the justices ruled .\nTrump filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late December asking for an immediate injunction to stop the Archives from turning over any records he \u2019 d claimed executive privilege over until the justices fully considered the case .\nHis request noted that the DC Circuit had specified that its temporary pause only applied to the first three tranches of documents , and that the archivist had identified a fourth tranche and planned to give it to the committee on Jan. 19 barring a court order .\nTrump had claimed executive privilege over six pages in the fourth tranche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers argued that the Supreme Court should block any production of contested documents \u201c for the sake of judicial efficiency and because of the similarity of the legal issues between the various tranches.\n\u201d The final brief was filed in the Supreme Court on Jan. 13 .\nOn the evening of Jan. 18 , the Justice Department submitted a letter to the DC Circuit confirming that the Archives planned to turn over the fourth tranche at the end of the next day unless any court told the agency not to do so .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archivist had been poised to produce that collection shortly after the DC Circuit \u2019 s decision in December , but Biden ordered a delay to give Trump time to go back to the lower courts to argue for another injunction .\nThe Justice Department specified that the archivist was prepared to turn over four of the six pages that Trump had objected to , since two were similar to documents in the first three tranches that remained in limbo .\nTrump \u2019 s lead attorney Jesse Binnall did not immediately return a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson for the National Archives .",

        "content": "President Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms , in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country .\n\u201c Like every other major civil rights bill that came along , if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one , '' he said .\n`` We missed this time .\nWe missed this time.\n\u201d After traveling to Georgia earlier this week \u2014 in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules , which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills .\nBut after his meeting with senators , the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules \u2014 and passing the voting rights package \u2014 are not looking likely .\n\u201c I hope we can get this done , but the honest to god answer is I don \u2019 t know whether we can get this done , \u201d Biden said .\nNormally a bill requires 60 votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate .\nDemocrats have only a 50\u201350 majority , including the tiebreaker , and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority .\nAt least two Democratic senators , Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia , oppose this plan , dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need .\nSinema gave a speech Thursday morning saying she supports the voting rights bills , but not changing the Senate rules to pass them .\nShe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c disease of division \u201d that has broken American politics .\nDemocrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway , knowing they don \u2019 t have the numbers .\nIt \u2019 s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose , but Democrats say this issue is unique .\n\u201c I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the usual sort of strategy approach around here .\nYou \u2019 re either for democracy or you \u2019 re not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s important to have , frankly , every one of us on the record.\n\u201d Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats \u2019 doomed push .\n\u201c It makes perfect political sense , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re Joe Biden , you \u2019 ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power .\nIf you \u2019 re Chuck Schumer , you \u2019 ve got to call the question or you \u2019 re going to get a primary .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a red state , it \u2019 s probably good politics for you .\nSo this is perfectly good politics for both sides.\n\u201d The voting rights package , named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis , would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions , create nationwide minimum early voting day standards , make Election Day a federal holiday , and allow the courts and federal government to intervene if a state passes restrictions that target minority groups .\nLast year , Republicans put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make voting more restrictive .\nVoting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia , where several of those bills were enacted , boycotted Biden \u2019 s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday , instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures .\nSeveral of those leaders , from groups including Black Voters Matter , the New Georgia Project , and Asian Americans Advancing Justice , said they would expect Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to that criticism , in an email to those leaders on Wednesday , the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday \u201c to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation \u201d before thanking them for their \u201c work and advocacy on this issue.\n\u201d On Thursday , two of the Georgia voting rights leaders who boycotted the president \u2019 s Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance of passing right now .\n\u201c Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand , \u201d said James Woodall , former president of the Georgia NAACP .\n\u201c We have no luxury of , or privilege of , delaying this any longer .\nAnd so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.\n\u201d Ns\u00e9 Ufot , CEO of the New Georgia Project , said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want , '' Ufot said .\n`` I \u2019 m not in a position to figure that out , but he can , so I think that feels like a next step . ''\nUfot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority .\n\u201c We care deeply about this issue , because fuck these elected officials , we care about our families , we care about our communities , and that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We 're not going anywhere .\nAnd we 're never going to shut up about this .\n\u201d",

        "title": "The Founder Of The Oath Keepers Has Been Charged With Seditious Conspiracy",
        "content": "Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 others associated with the armed extremist group with seditious conspiracy , the first such charge to come out of the sprawling investigation of the Capitol insurrection since it began just over a year ago .\nRhodes , 56 , was arrested on Thursday shortly before noon local time in Little Elm , Texas , about 35 miles north of Dallas .\nA second man , Edward Vallejo , 63 , was arrested in Phoenix , according to the Department of Justice .\nThe other nine defendants have all previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case pending in Washington , DC , federal court .\nAccording to the indictment , which was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday and sealed until the following day , Rhodes conspired \u201c to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power \u201d by stopping Congress \u2019 s certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 .\nHe and the other defendants , prosecutors claim , \u201c coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington , DC , equipped themselves with a variety of weapons , donned combat and tactical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodes \u2019 s call to take up arms at Rhodes \u2019 s direction.\n\u201d Attorney Jonathan Moseley , who represents another member of the Oath Keepers , said he was on the phone with Rhodes when the FBI called on the other line asking the group 's founder to come outside so he could be arrested .\nKellye SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 general counsel , said she is working to find a criminal defense attorney to represent Rhodes .\nShe called the arrest \u201c all part of the show \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire representation .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol , the acting US attorney in Washington , DC , at the time , Michael Sherwin , announced that a task force had been formed to explore more serious charges in connection with Jan. 6 , including seditious conspiracy .\nBut although more than 725 people have since been charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies for their involvement in the events of Jan. 6 , a number of whom are facing conspiracy charges related to obstructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral College , none has previously been charged with crimes related to sedition \u2014 which amounts to inciting a rebellion against the government .\nThe charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison .\nIt \u2019 s a rarely charged offense .\nFederal prosecutors last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment involving members of a militant group , and a judge ended up acquitting the defendants of the sedition count two years later .\nRhodes , whose first name is Elmer but who goes by his middle name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Known for the distinctive patch he wears to cover up an eye he lost from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound , he is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School who was later disbarred from practicing law .\nHe worked briefly for former member of Congress Ron Paul and rose to prominence as a frequent guest on Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars program , as well as for leading the Oath Keepers members into a series of charged political events , including the 2014 confrontation between cattle ranchers and federal law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundy standoff .\nRhodes , originally from Nevada , lived for years in Montana , but since separating from his wife in 2018 has lived an itinerant life .\nHe settled most recently in Granbury , Texas , where SoRelle , the Oath Keepers \u2019 attorney , is based .\nA longtime libertarian and critic of political figures on both sides of the aisle , Rhodes became more closely aligned with former president Donald Trump in the lead-up to and wake of the 2020 election , casting doubt on the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oath Keepers to attend protests and gather in Washington on Jan. 6 .\nThe original conspiracy case filed against members of the Oath Keepers in late January 2021 has grown to nearly two dozen defendants .\nIn the process , it has danced around Rhodes ' involvement in their activities , referring to him as `` Person One '' in court filings .\nNine of the 17 defendants in that case were also charged with seditious conspiracy in the new indictment .\nAccording to the 48-page , 17-count indictment , Rhodes began preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2020 , just two days after the presidential election , when he invited other Oath Keeper members to a leadership chat on the messaging platform Signal .\n\u201c We aren \u2019 t getting through this without a civil war , \u201d Rhodes wrote at the time .\n\u201c Too late for that .\nPrepare your mind , body , spirit.\n\u201d Over the following weeks and months , prosecutors allege , he employed increasingly fiery language to encourage the group 's members to prepare for conflict and , ultimately , to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloody and desperate fight , \u201d he wrote on Signal on Dec. 11 .\n\u201c We are going to have to fight .\nThat can \u2019 t be avoided.\n\u201d Between Dec. 30 and Jan. 2 , Rhodes bought some $ 12,000 worth of firearms and accessories , including a shotgun , night vision goggles , and large amounts of ammunition , the indictment alleges .\nOn Jan. 3 , he departed Granbury , Texas , for Washington , stopping twice en route to spend an additional $ 10,500 on an AR-15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other accessories .\nAnd in the two weeks after Jan. 6 , he spent an additional $ 17,500 on such items .\nIt \u2019 s not clear where Rhodes stored such items while in Washington .\nThe indictment details his work to help coordinate a so-called Quick Reaction Force , or QRF , composed of members of the Oath Keepers and associates from Florida , North Carolina , and Arizona who stowed their weapons in a Comfort Inn in Arlington , Virginia .\nOne of those individuals , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona and a self-described \u201c activist \u201d who served as an alternative delegate for the state \u2019 s Republican Party and attended the 2012 Republican National Convention .\nIn a message sent to another member of the Oath Keepers on Jan. 4 , he referred to the Comfort Inn as the \u201c allied encampment.\n\u201d Appearing on a podcast early on Jan. 6 , he discussed the possibility of \u201c guerilla war , \u201d noting \u201c there are people who are prepared , have the will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taunt.\n\u201d Although Rhodes is not accused of entering the Capitol , prosecutors now say he entered \u201c restricted grounds \u201d on Jan. 6 by standing outside the building while it was being stormed , and they detail how he directed the movements of people who ended up penetrating the complex .\nAmid the chaos , Rhodes reacted to incoming messages that were claiming members of antifa were pushing past the Capitol Police .\nLater that night , the charging document claims , Rhodes joined several other members of the Oath Keepers celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant in Vienna , Virginia .\nAmid the festivities , he sent out an encrypted message : \u201c Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared to what \u2019 s coming.\n\u201d Given the encrypted nature of the Signal chats Rhodes engaged in , it \u2019 s not clear how prosecutors were able to gather their evidence .\nFederal agents seized Rhodes \u2019 phone last May , and he sat for an interview with the FBI in July .\nIn September , the government also used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s phone .\nThat warrant identified \u201c seditious conspiracy \u201d as a possible crime being investigated .\nMeanwhile , four other alleged members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department , presumably sharing their phones with investigators .\nAlthough little has been heard from those people , last month , prosecutors said they were continuing to help the government .\nThe new indictment effectively splits the Oath Keepers defendants into separate cases .\nThe original case , which charges conspiracy to interfere with Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is slimmed down to seven defendants .\nRhodes , meanwhile , faces the sedition-related charge , along with the other conspiracy count , alongside Kelly Meggs , Kenneth Harrelson , Jessica Watkins , Joshua James , Roberto Minuta , Joseph Hackett , David Moerschel , Brian Ulrich , and Thomas Caldwell .\nRhodes and seven of the other defendants were also charged with obstruction for deleting electronic records in the wake of Jan. 6 .\nProsecutors have also secured a separate new indictment against a previous Oath Keepers defendant , Jonathan Walden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and illegally being at the Capitol , but he does not face any conspiracy allegation .\nIt was not immediately clear what impact the new charges will have on the court \u2019 s schedule .\nShortly before the holidays , US District Judge Amit Mehta rejected efforts by the defendants in the Oath Keepers case to get the conspiracy charges tossed out .\nThe judge had planned to begin trial on one group of Oath Keepers in April , with a possible second trial in July .\nIt now seems likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at play .\nUnlike many of the charges brought against alleged Capitol rioters so far , which have focused on the physical criminal acts committed that day \u2014 such as assaulting police , disrupting Congress \u2019 s certification of the election results , and simply illegally being in the Capitol \u2014 sedition deals with a person \u2019 s intent to go against the US government .\nThe felony offense makes it a crime to \u201c conspire to overthrow , put down , or to destroy by force the Government of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to oppose by force the authority thereof , or by force to prevent , hinder , or delay the execution of any law of the United States , or by force to seize , take , or possess any property of the United States.\n\u201d In a public address last week marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack , Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled that people who hadn \u2019 t gone into the Capitol could still face prosecution for any involvement in the insurrection .\n\u201c The Justice Department remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any level , accountable under law , \u201d he said , \u201c whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.\n\u201d The Oath Keepers , along with the Proud Boys , have been a point of focus for the select congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 .\nIn November , the committee subpoenaed Rhodes to provide documents and a deposition , citing \u201c credible evidence of \u201d his involvement in the Capitol insurrection .\nAccording to Moseley , Rhodes was scheduled to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attorney represents Kelly Meggs , one of the other members of the Oath Keepers who is now indicted for seditious conspiracy , and had hoped Rhodes could be a witness for his client in the case .\nAt the time the FBI called on Thursday , Moseley and Rhodes were discussing whether the group leader would answer the committee \u2019 s questions or invoke the Fifth Amendment , the lawyer said .\nIt took a few minutes for Rhodes to go outside , he added , because he was not yet dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly relieved , \u201d said Tasha Adams , who filed for divorce from Rhodes in early 2018 , claiming that he had been physically and emotionally abusive to her and their children .\n\u201c I feel like I just set down a heavy weight that I have been carrying .\nThe weight of constant fear , of always looking over my shoulder to make sure my kids are safe .\n\u201d",

Eric Swalwell , and one brought by two US Capitol Police officers .\nA ruling from Mehta wo n't end the legal wrangling over Trump \u2019 s civil liability for the insurrection .\nIf Trump fails to convince Mehta to toss these first three cases , he could ask an appeals court and potentially the US Supreme Court to intervene .\nIf Trump succeeds at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there are four other civil lawsuits pending that accuse Trump of inciting the violence , plus one filed before Jan. 6 that accuses Trump of conspiring with the Republican National Committee to violate the rights of Black voters by trying to undermine the results of the election .\nTrump \u2019 s lead attorney , Jesse Binnall \u2014 a Virginia-based lawyer representing Trump in an array of postpresidency legal fights , and who counts Trump ally Michael Flynn as a former client and conservative attorney and activist Sidney Powell as a former co-counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the \u201c outer perimeters \u201d of a president \u2019 s actions while in office .\nMehta asked if Binnall wanted the judge to ignore the content of what Trump said on Jan. 6 .\nBinnall replied yes , explaining that what mattered for immunity was the type of act at issue , which in this case was a speech to the American people , something that is part of being president .\nMehta pushed back , pointing out that the lawsuits alleged that Trump had appeared at the Jan. 6 rally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for office .\nThe judge asked Binnall why that wouldn \u2019 t place Trump outside the immunity that \u2019 s meant to protect a president against being sued for actions that were part of their official duties .\nBinnall argued that there was too much overlap between a president \u2019 s duties and political motivations to try to draw a clear line .\nEven if campaign activities weren \u2019 t covered by the immunity , Binnall said , Trump \u2019 s speech on Jan. 6 was not part of his campaign .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had contacted Georgia \u2019 s top election official to ask him to \u201c find \u201d votes to overturn President Joe Biden \u2019 s win in the state .\nMehta asked Binnall if presidential immunity would apply to that type of phone call .\nBinnall said it would because a president had a constitutional duty to ensure laws were faithfully executed .\nWhen the judge noted that part of the Constitution didn \u2019 t apply to state laws , Binnall said that when it came to federal elections , state and federal functions merged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get immunity if they made defamatory statements at a campaign rally .\nBinnall said yes .\nThe judge then asked if there was anything a president could say while they were in office that they could be sued for .\nBinnall said he \u2019 d tried to think of examples and could not .\nOn the substance of the lawsuits , Mehta said that the plaintiffs had alleged a \u201c very unusual \u201d and \u201c problematic \u201d conspiracy .\nTaken together , the cases accused Trump of conspiring with high-profile allies like Rudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are being criminally prosecuted for storming the Capitol .\nThe judge noted that the lawsuits didn \u2019 t feature the kind of direct communication among co-conspirators that would normally be part of a case like this .\nHe expressed concern that it would be \u201c dangerous \u201d to build a conspiracy case off of reactions to political speech .\nJoseph Sellers , an attorney for the congressional Democrats suing Trump who argued on behalf of all three sets of plaintiffs on Monday , maintained that the lawsuits did lay out facts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d and not just a one-sided reaction to Trump \u2019 s speech .\nHe said that Trump \u2019 s supporters engaged with his social media posts leading up to Jan. 6 about coming to Washington , that Trump urged the crowd to go to the Capitol even as people yelled out about storming and invading the building , and that Trump failed to immediately try to stop the riot , which could be seen as proof that he endorsed the mob .\nSellers said that the law didn \u2019 t require them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendants , and he pointed out that they had presented facts that alleged coordination between two right-wing groups named in one of the cases , the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys .\nMehta acknowledged that was true , but noted that the plaintiffs would likely be disappointed if he allowed the conspiracy claims against those groups to go forward but dismissed them against Trump .\nMehta is deeply familiar with the Justice Department \u2019 s theories so far on the role that members of the Oath Keepers played on Jan. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large conspiracy case that prosecutors have brought against members of the group ; charges are pending against 17 defendants , and four defendants have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government .\nThe Oath Keepers have a pending motion to dismiss the Democrats \u2019 civil lawsuit they \u2019 re named in , and Mehta is considering that as well .\nDuring an exchange with Binnall about the future of the conspiracy claim against Trump , Mehta asked about the fact that Trump didn \u2019 t tweet or put out other public statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack had begun .\nBinnall said that a president couldn \u2019 t be liable for not taking a certain action .\nThe judge countered that Trump \u2019 s public silence could support the idea that Trump understood he was part of an agreement to disrupt Congress \u2019 s activities on Jan. 6 .\nMehta also drew a comparison to a civil lawsuit against organizers of the \u201c Unite the Right \u201d rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , in 2017 that turned violent ; a jury last year found white nationalist Richard Spencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racially motivated violence .\nMehta on Monday also considered whether claims lodged against Donald Trump Jr. and Giuliani , who were named as defendants in Swalwell \u2019 s case , could go forward .\nMehta suggested there wasn \u2019 t as much of a record of Trump Jr. making public calls to action to the same extent as his father , and referenced public reports that Trump Jr. had messaged Trump \u2019 s chief of staff at the time , Mark Meadows , to try to get Trump to stop the mob .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mehta heard arguments on defendant Republican Rep. Mo Brooks \u2019 effort to have the US government step into the case on his behalf , based on the argument that he was acting in his official capacity when he spoke at the Jan. 6 rally .\nThe Justice Department has opposed stepping in on his behalf .",

        "content": "We hope you love the products we recommend !\nAll of them were independently selected by our editors .\nJust so you know , BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nAlong with many other changes , the pandemic ushered in a new emphasis on at-home exercise equipment \u2014 some of it pretty pricey .\nYes , Peloton was founded in 2012 and the Mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard much about them until spring 2020 , when lockdowns and gym closures meant that most people exercised at home or not at all .\nMore recently , a strength training\u2013focused machine called Tonal has been getting attention , due in part to the company \u2019 s notable lineup of celebrity spokespeople , including Serena Williams , LeBron James , Steph Curry , and Maria Sharapova .\nTonal is basically a digital screen that attaches to your wall ( a professional installation is necessary ) that has an attached pulley system for strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access workout videos , connect with other users , and track your progress .\nAnother reason ( aside from COVID ) that Tonal may be charging into the spotlight is that muscle-building workouts are sweeping through the fitness space at the moment .\n\u201c Whether it 's body composition , athletic performance , or even endurance athletes , I always just tell people strength is kind of like the foundation or base for pretty much everything , \u201d said Tony Gentilcore , cofounder of Cressey Sports Performance , which is a high-performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance athletes , like his clients who are interested in running the Boston Marathon , Gentilcore advises strength training to help them put more force into the ground and propel forward .\nStrength training can be intimidating for a beginner , especially at the gym or without a personal trainer offering guidance .\nWhile the Tonal sounds like a good idea \u2014 who wouldn \u2019 t want to try the machine that Serena Williams supposedly uses to train ?\n\u2014 is it really worth $ 3,000 or more to do so ?\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTonal addresses those deterrents in what I genuinely believe to be one of the most compact home workout formats I \u2019 ve seen , which could be really useful for people who have small spaces or live in smaller homes .\nI visited their Fifth Avenue showroom in NYC for a demo , which anyone can do at no cost if there \u2019 s a nearby location .\n( Tonal is now available at 40 Nordstrom retail stores in 24 states nationwide . )\nYou can also check it out via a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical locations near you ( or you \u2019 d just prefer to do it at home ) .\nI \u2019 d recommend the in-person experience if possible since adjusting the arms and attaching the smart accessories for the strength assessment can be tricky to figure out on your own .\nAside from the price point , my biggest concern about Tonal is the potential difficulty of navigating the equipment and interface .\nIt is not impossible .\nBut as with any technology , there will likely be a learning curve .\nHow much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a mounted mirrorlike touchscreen display with an adjustable arm on either side ( for $ 2,995 ) .\nThe arms remain flush with the screen when they \u2019 re not in use , so it really does just look like a fancy mirror you might see on any wall in your home .\nThat being said , the screen alone is relatively pointless unless you purchase the smart accessories bundle , which is an extra $ 495 .\nThe bundle includes two smart handles , a smart bar , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one or both of the arms and allow the machine to adjust the weight based on your own personal strength .\nIt also includes a bench , foam roller , and workout mat .\nWithout these accessories , I don \u2019 t see how you could get a tailored experience ; it would just be a screen that projects workout videos .\nThe bench is fairly slim and can sit under the machine without taking up too much additional space , while the rest of the accessories can hang from a sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the wall as the screen .\nOn top of that , delivery with professional installation ( which is required for the warranty ) is $ 250 , and the Tonal membership that gives you unlimited access to the full library of workouts is another $ 49 per month and it 's mandatory for the first 12 months .\nWhile the device is relatively compact , you still need 7 feet of vertical and horizontal space to install it and a 7-foot-10-inch ceiling height .\nAlso necessary is a grounded three-prong outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150-pound device .\n( Tonal is able to generate up to 200 pounds of resistance by using an electric motor . )\nThere \u2019 s no doubt that the equipment and membership add up to a lot of money .\nHere \u2019 s why you might want a Tonal The thing is , my brother just turned his suburban basement into a home gym , which takes up about 10 times the space with 20 times the pieces of equipment .\n( He bought a bench press with various weights , Bowflex adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mini treadmill , just to name a few . )\nA full home gym probably costs just as much if not more money than a Tonal .\nNot everyone has the space to fill a whole room with workout gear , the time to go to a gym four to five days a week , or the ability to hire a trainer to learn how to use the equipment and help keep you motivated .\nOne of the best perks of using Tonal , in my opinion , is that it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , but that it also tracks your progress from the privacy of your own home .\nEach member of the household can set up their own profile and conduct a personalized strength assessment to establish their starting point .\nThat allows the machine to set an optimal weight for every single one of the 200 moves you can do on this one machine ( as long as you have the smart accessories , that is ) , ensuring that you \u2019 re maximizing each exercise without pushing yourself too far .\nEach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to activate and deactivate the weight \u2014 so if you \u2019 re struggling , you can simply press it and all weight will be released .\nWhile a maximum resistance of 200 pounds may not be enough for the weightlifting pros , it should be plenty for beginner to intermediate exercisers .\nWith the membership , you can also access from anywhere the videos on the app , which include everything from strength training to yoga to guided Theragun sessions that don \u2019 t require the Tonal equipment .\nScrolling through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally easy and intuitive , though , even with the video guidance , it took a few tries for me to adjust the arms to the proper positions .\nThe Spotter technology monitors for signs of stress or fatigue and automatically decreases the weight if you are struggling , while 17 sensors provide direction on form and technique .\nAfter my guided strength assessment and completing one 15-minute , full-body workout video , I felt confident that I \u2019 d be able to do it all on my own and master the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout only used the smart bar and bodyweight to complete exercises like Romanian deadlifts , bent-over rows , weighted squats , and burpees .\nBecause my lower body is significantly stronger than my upper body , the smart bar was much heavier during my deadlifts and lightened up for the bent-over rows .\nBy the end , I felt sufficiently engaged , challenged , and excited to see my strength score creep up ever so slightly .\nIf you \u2019 re more experienced and prefer to choose your own moves , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your music service of choice to play your favorite soundtrack while you do it .\nTo help motivate you even further , you can connect your Tonal account with those of friends or family members to compare progress or even see where you stand among all Tonal users across the country .\nFull disclosure , at this moment in time and place in my life , I \u2019 m not willing to make the monetary investment that a Tonal requires .\nBut that \u2019 s not to say I don \u2019 t see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re unable to find another way to exercise .\nIf I lived farther from workout facilities , or had a family or work lifestyle that didn \u2019 t allow me the time to practice strength training in another context , I would definitely consider Tonal over the other at-home workout machines at this price point .\nOne other factor : I live in an apartment , and permanently attaching a heavy device to a wall could make it tricky to move at some point in the future .\n( Tonal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\nThat said , it \u2019 s truly all you need in one relatively compact , impressively high-tech , and customizable machine .\nYou can buy the full Tonal system starting at $ 2,995 .",

        "content": "The media allowed misinformation to frame \u201c debates \u201d about trans identity and race in education .\nThat has to change .\nThere \u2019 s a long history in the US of setting the terms of debate by centering media narratives around the well-being of white women and children .\nIt \u2019 s usually associated with anti-Black and anti-gay right-wing activism and can be traced back to anti\u2013school integration campaigns in the \u2019 60s , through \u201c save the children \u201d anti-gay campaigns in the \u2019 70s , and even the coverage questioning how children would fare under marriages between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists used similar framing to introduce the so-called controversy over \u201c critical race theory.\n\u201d Attempts to eradicate histories of race in the US are nothing new .\nAs recently as 2011 , activists attempted to ban ethnic studies and Mexican American studies curricula in Arizona .\nBut \u201c ethnic studies \u201d simply doesn \u2019 t have the polarizing \u2014 or \u201c concerning \u201d \u2014 ring necessary to stoke a national panic about existing curricular offerings like studying civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr .\nThe term \u201c critical race theory \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because , as one activist told the New Yorker this summer , to \u201c most \u201d Americans it \u201c connotes hostile , academic , divisive , race-obsessed , poisonous , elitist , anti-American.\n\u201d So a long-term campaign to dismantle any talk of race and history in schools was rebranded as a crusade against critical race theory , even though that term actually refers to a graduate-level theory about the intersections of law , culture , and structural racism that has nothing to do with elementary history in classrooms .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c debates \u201d have been pushed into the media by right-wing activism and conservative politicians through strategic waves of anti-CRT and anti-trans bills .\nThey \u2019 re even timed to purposely inflame conservatives and rally the base for elections .\nBut at this point , it \u2019 s too easy to see anti-trans and anti-Black concern-mongering as just an issue of right-wing misinformation .\nAfter all , these framings are accepted for coverage via the editorial judgments of majority white and cis newsrooms .\nSo-called culture war issues are where the media allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white \u201c anxieties \u201d and fears about a changing world .\nBut the terms for what becomes a culture war story are not decided by the public .\nInstead , they are decided in newsrooms that don \u2019 t mirror reality but certainly help shape it .\nAmerican newsrooms are even whiter than the country as a whole , and it \u2019 s in that context of media echo chambers that \u201c critical race theory \u201d is repackaged as controversial .\nMost Americans believe the history of slavery should be taught , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , polls showed that even the idea that critical race theory drove elections was overstated .\nSimilarly , trans rights are actually not \u201c controversial \u201d in the US population at large .\nBut trans journalists are woefully underrepresented in newsrooms .\nIt \u2019 s predictable that cis journalists talking to each other about transness results in stories that home in on and magnify cis debates about trans identity .\nThis dynamic sidelines the potential richness of good faith exchanges within the trans community about the complexity of existing in a cis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on anti-science or partisan campaigns that exist in the social media ether .\nBut there are other important questions , like the way the media feeds into misinformation by platforming sources that reframe debate outside the terms of the communities these \u201c debates \u201d actually affect .\n\u201c Partisanship \u201d is still the favored term in journalism for talking about media \u201c balance.\n\u201d But considering editorial judgment through partisanship simply recreates existing power imbalances by focusing on issues about race , class , and gender only if they \u2019 re legible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt would mean something quite different if corporate media held itself accountable to the communities it covers rather than political parties .\nCategorizing questions about ethical coverage through partisanship issues also helps ignore uncomfortable realities about news capitalism , like the fact that newsrooms need to make a profit and stories are often packaged for advertisers and imagined white readers .\nFinancial incentives are a major reason why it \u2019 s hard to wean media off engaging with misinformative framings to capture cis and white readers , which still constitute a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these panicked stories feed engagement for Twitter , Facebook , legacy media , and new venture capitalist corporate platforms like Substack .\nIt \u2019 s not an accident that in all the race and trans backlash stories , class is invoked not to call out how white middle- and upper-class perspectives shape newsrooms ( including through media CEOs ) .\nInstead , it is invoked to imply that anti-racism or trans rights are somehow an \u201c elitist \u201d concern .\nThis framing takes pressure off the publications themselves to engage with these issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsrooms .\nBut divorcing stories about class and identity from the real world and existing power structures is a distortion .\nFraming and context shouldn \u2019 t only be dictated by cis white fears and concerns .\nStill , there have been some changes by newsrooms around the framing of stories to acknowledge power imbalances in the real world .\nThe Verge has updated its policies for giving big tech companies anonymity as background sources for articles .\nSome news organizations are questioning the uncritical use of police sources when ascertaining the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned parents \u201d might be less obviously identifiable as problematic sources , but it \u2019 s a powerful category of people due for a similar reckoning .\nTellingly , after a backlash to the white framing of its \u201c how young is too young \u201d CRT story , CBS changed the headline \u2014 not to , say , \u201c White Parents Are Finally Having to Grapple with Questions Others Routinely Do.\n\u201d Instead , it was replaced with a nonclickbait-y mouthful : \u201c Documentary explores debate over how and when race should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framing to \u201c debate \u201d is the customary way mainstream media dodges any pressure about \u201c taking sides.\n\u201d But platforming \u201c both sides \u201d implies we live in an already equal world .\nWe don \u2019 t .\nAnd that \u2019 s a fact .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "We hope you love the products we recommend !\nAll of them were independently selected by our editors .\nJust so you know , BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nAlong with many other changes , the pandemic ushered in a new emphasis on at-home exercise equipment \u2014 some of it pretty pricey .\nYes , Peloton was founded in 2012 and the Mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard much about them until spring 2020 , when lockdowns and gym closures meant that most people exercised at home or not at all .\nMore recently , a strength training\u2013focused machine called Tonal has been getting attention , due in part to the company \u2019 s notable lineup of celebrity spokespeople , including Serena Williams , LeBron James , Steph Curry , and Maria Sharapova .\nTonal is basically a digital screen that attaches to your wall ( a professional installation is necessary ) that has an attached pulley system for strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access workout videos , connect with other users , and track your progress .\nAnother reason ( aside from COVID ) that Tonal may be charging into the spotlight is that muscle-building workouts are sweeping through the fitness space at the moment .\n\u201c Whether it 's body composition , athletic performance , or even endurance athletes , I always just tell people strength is kind of like the foundation or base for pretty much everything , \u201d said Tony Gentilcore , cofounder of Cressey Sports Performance , which is a high-performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance athletes , like his clients who are interested in running the Boston Marathon , Gentilcore advises strength training to help them put more force into the ground and propel forward .\nStrength training can be intimidating for a beginner , especially at the gym or without a personal trainer offering guidance .\nWhile the Tonal sounds like a good idea \u2014 who wouldn \u2019 t want to try the machine that Serena Williams supposedly uses to train ?\n\u2014 is it really worth $ 3,000 or more to do so ?\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTonal addresses those deterrents in what I genuinely believe to be one of the most compact home workout formats I \u2019 ve seen , which could be really useful for people who have small spaces or live in smaller homes .\nI visited their Fifth Avenue showroom in NYC for a demo , which anyone can do at no cost if there \u2019 s a nearby location .\n( Tonal is now available at 40 Nordstrom retail stores in 24 states nationwide . )\nYou can also check it out via a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical locations near you ( or you \u2019 d just prefer to do it at home ) .\nI \u2019 d recommend the in-person experience if possible since adjusting the arms and attaching the smart accessories for the strength assessment can be tricky to figure out on your own .\nAside from the price point , my biggest concern about Tonal is the potential difficulty of navigating the equipment and interface .\nIt is not impossible .\nBut as with any technology , there will likely be a learning curve .\nHow much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a mounted mirrorlike touchscreen display with an adjustable arm on either side ( for $ 2,995 ) .\nThe arms remain flush with the screen when they \u2019 re not in use , so it really does just look like a fancy mirror you might see on any wall in your home .\nThat being said , the screen alone is relatively pointless unless you purchase the smart accessories bundle , which is an extra $ 495 .\nThe bundle includes two smart handles , a smart bar , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one or both of the arms and allow the machine to adjust the weight based on your own personal strength .\nIt also includes a bench , foam roller , and workout mat .\nWithout these accessories , I don \u2019 t see how you could get a tailored experience ; it would just be a screen that projects workout videos .\nThe bench is fairly slim and can sit under the machine without taking up too much additional space , while the rest of the accessories can hang from a sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the wall as the screen .\nOn top of that , delivery with professional installation ( which is required for the warranty ) is $ 250 , and the Tonal membership that gives you unlimited access to the full library of workouts is another $ 49 per month and it 's mandatory for the first 12 months .\nWhile the device is relatively compact , you still need 7 feet of vertical and horizontal space to install it and a 7-foot-10-inch ceiling height .\nAlso necessary is a grounded three-prong outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150-pound device .\n( Tonal is able to generate up to 200 pounds of resistance by using an electric motor . )\nThere \u2019 s no doubt that the equipment and membership add up to a lot of money .\nHere \u2019 s why you might want a Tonal The thing is , my brother just turned his suburban basement into a home gym , which takes up about 10 times the space with 20 times the pieces of equipment .\n( He bought a bench press with various weights , Bowflex adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mini treadmill , just to name a few . )\nA full home gym probably costs just as much if not more money than a Tonal .\nNot everyone has the space to fill a whole room with workout gear , the time to go to a gym four to five days a week , or the ability to hire a trainer to learn how to use the equipment and help keep you motivated .\nOne of the best perks of using Tonal , in my opinion , is that it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , but that it also tracks your progress from the privacy of your own home .\nEach member of the household can set up their own profile and conduct a personalized strength assessment to establish their starting point .\nThat allows the machine to set an optimal weight for every single one of the 200 moves you can do on this one machine ( as long as you have the smart accessories , that is ) , ensuring that you \u2019 re maximizing each exercise without pushing yourself too far .\nEach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to activate and deactivate the weight \u2014 so if you \u2019 re struggling , you can simply press it and all weight will be released .\nWhile a maximum resistance of 200 pounds may not be enough for the weightlifting pros , it should be plenty for beginner to intermediate exercisers .\nWith the membership , you can also access from anywhere the videos on the app , which include everything from strength training to yoga to guided Theragun sessions that don \u2019 t require the Tonal equipment .\nScrolling through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally easy and intuitive , though , even with the video guidance , it took a few tries for me to adjust the arms to the proper positions .\nThe Spotter technology monitors for signs of stress or fatigue and automatically decreases the weight if you are struggling , while 17 sensors provide direction on form and technique .\nAfter my guided strength assessment and completing one 15-minute , full-body workout video , I felt confident that I \u2019 d be able to do it all on my own and master the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout only used the smart bar and bodyweight to complete exercises like Romanian deadlifts , bent-over rows , weighted squats , and burpees .\nBecause my lower body is significantly stronger than my upper body , the smart bar was much heavier during my deadlifts and lightened up for the bent-over rows .\nBy the end , I felt sufficiently engaged , challenged , and excited to see my strength score creep up ever so slightly .\nIf you \u2019 re more experienced and prefer to choose your own moves , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your music service of choice to play your favorite soundtrack while you do it .\nTo help motivate you even further , you can connect your Tonal account with those of friends or family members to compare progress or even see where you stand among all Tonal users across the country .\nFull disclosure , at this moment in time and place in my life , I \u2019 m not willing to make the monetary investment that a Tonal requires .\nBut that \u2019 s not to say I don \u2019 t see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re unable to find another way to exercise .\nIf I lived farther from workout facilities , or had a family or work lifestyle that didn \u2019 t allow me the time to practice strength training in another context , I would definitely consider Tonal over the other at-home workout machines at this price point .\nOne other factor : I live in an apartment , and permanently attaching a heavy device to a wall could make it tricky to move at some point in the future .\n( Tonal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\nThat said , it \u2019 s truly all you need in one relatively compact , impressively high-tech , and customizable machine .\nYou can buy the full Tonal system starting at $ 2,995 .",

.\n\u201c I will not be diplomatic on this , \u201d Kuleba wrote .\n\u201c Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from SWIFT has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian men , women and children will

the US \u2019 s coordination with NATO allies , including moving more Europe-based US troops to Germany to defend those allies .\nHe reiterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Putin directly at this point in the conflict .\nEarly on Thursday morning in Moscow , Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation to force Ukraine \u2019 s government and troops to surrender .\nShortly after Putin \u2019 s speech Ukrainian officials reported missiles and shelling starting across the country .\nBy nightfall , Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had laid out their demands : Ukraine must agree to give up all weapons on its territory and guarantee its neutral status .\nAs the attack unfolded , Biden issued a statement calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian military forces \u201d and promised that the United States and its allies would respond in a \u201c united and decisive way.\n\u201d US officials had repeatedly said they would impose significant sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine .\nOn Tuesday , Biden acknowledged that Putin moving troops into Eastern Ukraine was \u201c the beginning of an invasion , \u201d and announced an initial round of penalties : fully blocking two major Russian financial institutions , sanctions on Russian foreign debt \u2014 effectively cutting off the government from Western financing \u2014 and sanctions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included Germany withholding approval of the Nord Stream Two , a gas pipeline that the Russian energy industry had been banking on as an important source of income .\nThursday \u2019 s sanctions follow broad economic and trade sanctions against Russian financial institutions and moves to block new US investments in two regions of Eastern Ukraine , which are controlled by Russian-backed separatists .\nDuring a Thursday morning speech announcing the invasion , Putin warned against interference .\n\u201c To anyone who would consider interfering from outside : If you do , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have faced in history ,

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nThanks to the utter travesty that is sex education in America and the lack of realism in porn or really any media depictions of sex , sexual pleasure can be hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you \u2019 re interested in taking the steps to learn what you might actually like , it may be time to bring on the sex toys .\n\u201c We still live in a culture that tends to normalize certain kinds of sex and make that expected for everyone , \u201d said Carol Queen , staff sexologist at Good Vibrations , a sex-positive adult toy shop founded in 1977 .\n\u201c Many people don \u2019 t understand even now that the clitoris , for people who have one , is the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMany people think it \u2019 s the vagina , and while plenty of people love vaginal penetration , it \u2019 s not the primary way most people with vaginas orgasm.\n\u201d In fact , a 2017 study of more than 1,000 people ages 18 to 94 published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 % percent of people with vulvas could orgasm from internal stimulation alone .\nAside from targeting the clitoris , there are countless other ways to arouse people no matter what lies below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in nerve endings , so we can experience pleasure in our whole body , not just genitals , \u201d Brooklyn-based sex therapist Carolanne Marcantonio explained .\n\u201c Oftentimes we go right for the genitals , but there \u2019 s a whole world of pleasure to experience from head to toe.\n\u201d The number of nerve endings on your body vary , which is why some areas may feel more sensitive than others , but Marcantonio maintains that the brain is the largest erogenous zone .\nHow to find , choose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic interests and curiosity are the biggest guideposts to what they might like , \u201d said Queen , who has a PhD in sexology from The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality , in discussing how to find props that work for you .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re turned on to the idea of playing with just about anything , it \u2019 s a sex toy.\n\u201d That said , she emphasizes that it \u2019 s not safe to insert or use just any item you find around the house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting sex toy shops that were founded to make better quality sexual products available , especially to women .\nMarcantonio started her career on the sales floor at sex toy shop Babeland , which requires a monthlong training in the anatomy of pleasure and how to use appropriate language to respect customers \u2019 genders , expressions , and sexualities .\nVisiting a sex shop is a great way to find inspiration and consult with knowledgeable staff before making a purchase .\nIf you don \u2019 t find exactly what you \u2019 re looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different brands and types of products , you can then take your search online .\nThese days , you can also find sex toys at mainstream stores .\nIn the two years since Erica Minor became the marketing and communications manager , intimate lifestyle company Lelo has partnered with brands like Anthropologie , Urban Outfitters , and Neiman Marcus .\n\u201c We really work hard , especially with our marketing campaigns , to break down the shame and stigma around sex and pleasure but also provide representation , \u201d Minor said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been socially acceptable for a certain minority of the population to talk about sex and express themselves sexually , so we really want to open that up to everybody regardless of their sexual expression , gender identity , race , or sex.\n\u201d \u201c I love being able to introduce people to the many ways you can use these vibrators , \u201d said Julia Lopez , lead product engineer at Dame .\n\u201c People assume it \u2019 s just one way , but men love vibrators too.\n\u201d Queen agrees .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2014 anybody might like vibration , \u201d she said .\nIn terms of use , most modern sex toys are fairly versatile in how they can come into play , whether used solo or partnered .\n\u201c We \u2019 re only limited by how limited our creativity is , \u201d Marcantonio said .\n\u201c The sky \u2019 s the limit , so really anything can be a couple \u2019 s toy .\nAnything.\n\u201d There are also toys that target multiple erogenous zones to help facilitate blended orgasms , which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Blended orgasms are when more than one erogenous area gets stimulated at the same time , and it can increase the odds of orgasm or strong orgasm , \u201d Queen said .\n\u201c That thinking allows for us to sort of normalize and explore toys during intercourse or other kinds of sex play to add to the experience.\n\u201d Not only can incorporating toys into partnered sex lead to more satisfying experiences , but stepping outside of your comfort zone in a safe space may also have the added benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Exploring the building of trust and bonding and communication is also a heightened way to experience and build your coupledom , \u201d Marcantonio said .\nWhat materials are best for sex toys It \u2019 s essential for any sex toy to be made of something hypoallergenic and nonporous .\nSubstances that are able to break down or contain irritants should be avoided .\nThat list may include jelly rubber , which is made from polyvinyl chloride , or other compounds that could contain phthalates , which are potentially carcinogenic chemicals added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c A lot of sex toys have been made with that [ phthalates ] and because sex toys aren \u2019 t regulated , there 's no one telling companies not to use it , \u201d Lopez said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of on the consumer to make sure they are looking up what material the product is made out of , and pretty much every website will tell you what material it is , and then making sure that material is a stable nontoxic one.\n\u201d Experts agree that silicone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical-grade silicone , though borosilicate glass ( which is shatterproof ) and medical-grade stainless steel are also good options if you \u2019 re interested in temperature play .\nHowever , keep in mind that some types of lubricants can break down sex toys made of silicone , so use a water-based product in those cases .\nAnother perk of silicone is that you can sometimes boil them once you remove the motor for maximum disinfection , though in most cases a sex toy cleaner or mild soap and warm water will be sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a toy cleaner , Queen advises against using any with triclosan , which is an antibacterial compound that can be absorbed through your skin or mouth .\nToy cleaners are usable on those made from stainless steel or shatterproof glass as well , but the soap and water method should be sufficiently effective for any kind of waterproof sex toy .",

using your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and sticking to set bedtimes and wake times .\nShelby Harris , a clinical psychologist specializing in behavioral sleep medicine , also notes that if you tend to bury your head under the covers or can \u2019 t resist repeated snooze sessions , this type of alarm clock may not be the right choice .\nIt all depends on your ideal sleep environment and where your sleeping or waking issues are stemming from .\nIf you tend to struggle to get out of bed when you \u2019 re forced to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you experience season-related mood changes in general , you may have seasonal affective disorder .\nWhile anyone can have the \u201c winter blues , \u201d about 5 % of people have seasonal affective disorder , otherwise known as SAD or seasonal depression , according to the American Psychiatric Association .\nSAD is a type of depression that \u2019 s most common in fall and winter months , when there are fewer hours of sunlight per day , although it can occur in summer in some people .\nPeople who have SAD experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and it \u2019 s more common in women than men .\nOne common treatment is light therapy , which often comes in the form of a specific type of lamp .\n\u201c Light has a physiological direct impact on our mood , \u201d which is why light therapy helps with seasonal depression , Robbins explained .\nSince many of these sunrise alarm clocks have adjustable brightness settings , it makes sense that they could also help with some symptoms of SAD .\nThat said , light therapy for SAD treatment usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to a lightbox with a brightness of 10,000 lux each morning or a lightbox with a brightness of 2,500 lux for one to two hours .\nSunrise alarm clocks tend to have a lux that \u2019 s 300 or lower .\nWhile gradual light from an alarm clock might help improve your mood and ability to wake up , follow your healthcare provider \u2019 s guidance for any light-related treatments if you \u2019 ve been diagnosed with SAD .\nWhen Dr. Dasgupta thinks about alarm clocks or any other device that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , he thinks of one patient population in particular \u2014 those with insomnia .\nWhile almost everyone experiences an inability to sleep at some point , he \u2019 s referring to those with chronic insomnia , which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines as having symptoms more than three times per week for up to three months .\nInsomnia generally involves difficulty initiating sleep and maintaining sleep throughout the night .\nWhile he emphasizes that the mainstay therapy for these issues is cognitive behavioral therapy , sunrise alarm clocks are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c You have to have all the right pieces to complete that puzzle to get that good sleep , \u201d he said .\n\u201c When people try different things to get good sleep , it really depends on what puzzle piece is missing.\n\u201d For some , that missing piece may be the comfort of a weighted blanket .\nFor others , a white noise machine may do the trick .\nBut if you \u2019 re sensitive to light and creating faux dawn sounds like a nicer way to wake than jarring beeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth trying out one of the clocks on this list .",

Wade was correctly decided , Jackson declined to answer , explaining it would be \u201c inappropriate \u201d since all Supreme Court decisions were binding on her as a lower court judge .\nIt \u2019 s a question that \u2019 s sure to come up again now that she \u2019 s nominated for the high court .\nThere \u2019 s a case pending before the justices that could dramatically upend the nationwide landscape of abortion rights by the end of this term , but its unlikely to end the fight altogether .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions came in late 2019 , when she concluded that then-president Donald Trump \u2019 s first White House counsel Don McGahn could not claim absolute immunity against a congressional subpoena to testify in the Russia investigation .\nMcGahn had played a star role in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s report .\nOnce Mueller \u2019 s office finished its work without bringing charges against Trump , Democrats in Congress wanted to pick up the thread with McGahn .\nBacked by the Justice Department under Trump , McGahn argued that current and former senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against congressional subpoenas , that the president had the final word on when to assert that immunity , and that courts lacked authority to intervene .\nJackson rejected all of the DOJ \u2019 s positions .\nHer opinion was stacked with sweeping declarations about how every person , including the president , ultimately is bound by the law .\nMcGahn could refuse to answer certain questions on executive privilege grounds , but he had to show up , she found .\n\u201c Stated simply , the primary takeaway from the past 250 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not kings , \u201d Jackson wrote .\nShe continued later : \u201c ... compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct , not a political one , and per the Constitution , no one is above the law .\nThat is to say , however busy or essential a presidential aide might be , and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects , the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires.\n\u201d The case ping-ponged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and a half on the question of whether the court had authority to hear it .\nThe first time it went up on appeal , a three-judge panel ruled 2-1 to dismiss the case , but then the full court sided with Jackson and

McGahn reached an agreement to testify , ending the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DC Circuit judge , Jackson has had a chance to weigh in on the latest round of fights over congressional demands for information related to Trump .\nIn December , she was part of a three-judge panel that unanimously rejected Trump \u2019 s last-ditch effort to stop the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection from getting certain archived White House records .\nYears before thousands of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol \u2014 a mob that included followers of the QAnon collective delusion \u2014 there was Pizzagate .\nSpurred by baseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives were involved in a child sex trafficking network with a connection to DC restaurant Comet Ping Pong , Edgar Maddison Welch traveled to DC from his home in North Carolina and entered the pizzeria with two loaded firearms .\nWelch searched the restaurant as patrons fled ; he claimed he was looking for kidnapped children .\nNo one was injured , but he fired an assault rifle to try to break the lock of a door and pointed the gun at an employee .\nHe was immediately taken into custody .\nWelch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson in June 2017 .\nShe sentenced him to four years in prison , which was more than the 18 months Welch \u2019 s lawyer argued for and slightly below the 4.5 years the government wanted .\nJackson said she believed Welch thought he was doing the right thing by going into the restaurant , but that didn \u2019 t excuse him from following the law \u2014 \u201c acting violently even for good causes is not okay , \u201d she said .\nShe spoke about grappling with how to craft a sentence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who were consuming the same information online that inspired Welch .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bThe fear is now that , even though no one was physically harmed in this case , other people who are worried about other issues will take up arms with the intent of sacrificing lives in order to achieve what they believe is a just result .\nAnd as I 'm sure you know , that kind of system of justice is utterly incompatible with our constitutional scheme and with the rule of law , \u201d Jackson said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial in the context of this case.\n\u201d Welch \u2019 s case did not end the conspiracy theories that motivated him , instead morphing into an integral part of the QAnon delusions .\nWhen a coalition of immigrant rights group \u2019 s challenged the Trump administration \u2019 s plan to expand the category of undocumented immigrants eligible for fast-track deportations , the case landed before Jackson .\nIn September 2019 , she issued a preliminary injunction blocking the changes .\nJackson found that the challengers were likely to succeed in arguing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt the policy in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act , which requires agencies to take \u201c into account all of the facts and circumstances that are relevant to their consequential policy determinations.\n\u201d Specifically , Jackson found that DHS had failed to explore existing problems with the expedited removal process as well as the effect expanding it would have on \u201c settled \u201d communities .\nThe DC Circuit later reversed Jackson \u2019 s injunction , disagreeing with her that the DHS secretary \u2019 s decision to expand fast-track deportations was the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APA .\nBut the circuit agreed with Jackson that the court could hear the case in the first place , and also found that she was on firm legal ground in blocking the policy as a whole nationwide , versus only as it applied to the groups that sued .\nThe Trump administration and conservative legal advocates criticized judges who entered nationwide injunctions halting his policies .\nJackson wrote at length in defense of the scope of her order , saying the government had \u201c conjured up a strawman \u201d in arguing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions after finding that an agency \u2019 s actions were \u201c fatally flawed.\n\u201d \u201c If this Court \u2019 s Order preliminarily prohibiting DHS from enforcing the expedited removal policy \u2026 reverberates nationally , that is simply and solely because DHS previously decided to apply its potentially defective rule nationwide , \u201d she wrote .\nAlso in September 2019 , Jackson gave the Trump administration a win in a different fight over its immigration policies .\nShe dismissed a challenge brought by environmental groups to the DHS secretary \u2019 s decision to waive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed up construction of barriers along the US\u2013Mexico border .\nJackson found that Congress had barred most legal challenges to these types of waivers and also that arguments contesting the constitutionality of the secretary \u2019 s waiver power fell short .\nIn October 2020 , Jackson sided with immigrant advocacy groups who sued the Trump administration over a lesson plan used to train federal immigration officers who screen potential asylum seekers slated for fast-track deportations .\nThe challengers argued the language adopted in 2019 wrongly raised the bar too high for the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person had shown a \u201c credible fear \u201d of persecution in their home country .\nJackson agreed .\nThe Justice Department decided not to pursue an appeal .\nLabor groups \u2014 longtime allies of Biden \u2014 were vocal about wanting a nominee with a record of backing workers \u2019 rights .\nJackson \u2019 s first written opinion as a DC Circuit judge was a win for federal employees .\nIn a 3-0 decision earlier this month , the court struck down a 2020 policy change by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in collective bargaining before making changes to work conditions .\nBefore the new policy , agencies had to bargain unless the changes would have a \u201c de minimis , \u201d or minimal , effect .\nThe new policy stated that agencies didn \u2019 t have to bargain unless a change would have a \u201c substantial impact.\n\u201d Public sector unions argued this created a new class of management decisions falling between \u201c de minimis \u201d and \u201c substantial \u201d that employers would no longer have to bargain over .\nJackson wrote that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t \u201c sufficiently reasoned.\n\u201d As a district court judge , Jackson presided over a set of challenges by federal labor unions to three executive orders issued by Trump that gave agencies new directives about how they should handle collective bargaining .\nJackson in August 2018 rejected the administration \u2019 s argument that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case and ruled that the bulk of the challenged orders violated federal law .\nNo presidential order could \u201c operate to eviscerate the right to bargain collectively , \u201d she wrote , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumulative effect.\n\u201d The DC Circuit later reversed her on the front-end jurisdiction issue and dismissed the case .",

''\n`` For too long our government and our courts have n't looked like America .\nI believe it 's time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation with a nominee of extraordinary qualifications , '' Biden said .\nHe was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris , whom he thanked for her counsel during the vetting process but did not speak .\nJackson , a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the DC Circuit , was widely considered a frontrunner for the next Supreme Court vacancy under a Democratic president long before Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement and Biden was even elected .\nShe brings both the elite credentials that have defined modern nominees \u2014 two Harvard degrees , prestigious clerkships , stints at white-shoe law firms ; as a federal public defender and member of the US Sentencing Commission , she also has less common professional experiences that liberals have clamored for on the bench .\nShe is poised to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the earliest iteration of the Supreme Court in 1789 .\nIf confirmed , Jackson not only would be the first Black woman to serve but also only the third Black person and the sixth woman .\nBlack women have been dramatically underrepresented across the federal bench .\nNominations of people of color and women picked up in the latter part of the 20th century , but the representation of Black women has continued to lag .\nDuring Friday 's White House event , Jackson began by thanking god and her family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constance Baker Motley , who was the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge .\nJackson noted that she and Motley shared a birthday , separated by 49 years .\n`` Today I proudly stand on Judge Motley 's shoulders , sharing not only her birthday but also her steadfast and courageous commitment to equal justice under law , '' Jackson said .\nJackson 's nomination was met with resounding enthusiasm across the Democratic political establishment and a wide array of advocacy groups who have increasingly organized around the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy wins on issues that matter most to liberals , including civil rights , voting access , gun control , reproductive health , the environment , and labor protections .\n`` This is a moment of joy , '' said Brandi Colander , one of the founders of She Will Rise , an advocacy group that 's been dedicated to advocating for a Black woman justice .\n`` Every American wins because we are creating a court that is more inclusive , that will be better equipped to handle the issues of today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US Senate , giving Biden the numbers he needs to move Jackson \u2019 s nomination through , but with little margin for error .\nJackson was nominated for the DC Circuit during Biden \u2019 s first year in office , giving her the benefit of recently going through the Senate confirmation process , not to mention the Republican opposition wringer .\nShe was confirmed to the appeals court in June 2021 by a vote of 53 to 44 , managing to secure a small amount of bipartisan support along with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the three Republicans who voted in favor of Jackson 's nomination to the DC Circuit , signaled that he might not support her for the Supreme Court .\nHe released a statement saying that the choice showed that `` the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again .

the volunteers engaged in 4,884 sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure rate was defined as the number of slippage , breakage , or both slippage and breakage events that occurred over the total number of sex acts performed .\nThe condom failure rate was actually lower for anal sex than it was for penis-in-vagina sex .\n\u201c We really thought that it was important to do this to have an explicit understanding of what the failure levels would be , \u201d said Siegler , who is also the associate director of the Emory Center for AIDS Research ( CFAR ) Prevention and Implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure levels were beyond what we had hoped.\n\u201d Specifically , the condom failure rate was 0.7 % during anal sex acts , most of which also incorporated a condom-compatible lubricant .\nThe addition of lubricant is considered a vital part of using condoms correctly for anal sex .\nUnprotected anal sex is considered to be the riskiest type of sex for getting STIs like HIV due to the thinner lining of the rectum , which is more easily damaged and can result in more tearing or abrasions of the skin .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condom use during anal intercourse , \u201d said Courtney Lias , director of the FDA \u2019 s Office of Gastrorenal , OB-GYN , General Hospital , and Urology Devices in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health , in a statement .\nThe clinical trial participants used a water-based lubricant , but any condom-compatible lubricant will reduce friction to help prevent breaking or slipping .\nSiegler emphasized that oil-based lubricants can actually damage latex , so it \u2019 s critical that you use only water- or silicone-based lubricants with condoms .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant for small business innovation from the National Institutes of Health .\nGlobal Protection Corp. joined the team later on and provided all condoms used in the study , which included its standard , thin , and fitted condoms , which come in 54 different sizes .\n( You can use a paper template to find the right condom size . )\nEarly stages of the research were aimed at gaining approval for condoms fitted to penile dimensions for vaginal use , and then shifted toward FDA clearance to label these condoms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I think if people believe that condoms are effective , they 're more likely to use them , \u201d Siegler said .\n\u201c The confidence of a very low failure rate for anal sex , I hope , will encourage an increase in condom use.\n\u201d Technically , these condoms are similar to other condoms on the market ; what sets them apart is a clinical trial demonstrating their efficacy during anal sex ( and that they offer so many custom fit options ) .\nThe FDA noted that other condoms authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used for contraception and to prevent STIs.\n\u201d There are about 300 condoms authorized for use during vaginal sex .\nThe One brand condoms can also be used to reduce the risk of pregnancy and STI transmission during vaginal intercourse .\nSiegler and Davin Wedel , founder and CEO of Global Protection Corp. , said the goal with this landmark labeling is more to get the information out there that condoms are safe and effective for anyone to use .\nSo it \u2019 s a good idea to use them no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having .\nHowever , if you want to buy the only condoms on the market that have been officially tested and authorized for anal sex , we don \u2019 t blame you .\n\u201c We truly believe that there \u2019 s a public health gap here , and we were really proud to be able to help fill that , \u201d Wedel told BuzzFeed News .\nYou can buy a 12-pack of One Condoms for around $ 9 .",

Jasmine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term currently running for a seat in Congress , said there \u2019 s \u201c no question \u201d that Texans would have an easier time now if Congress had passed federal voting rights legislation .\nCrockett and dozens of her fellow Democrats left the state and traveled to DC in the summer of 2021 , where their absence from the Texas legislature stalled the state \u2019 s voting measures , known as Senate Bill 1 .\nWhile in Washington , where Democrats control the White House and narrowly hold both chambers of Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect voting rights as a backstop to Republican-led efforts on the state level , meeting with elected officials from Vice President Kamala Harris to Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin .\nJust a few months later , hope for that legislation is nearly nonexistent , after all 50 Republican senators , Manchin , and Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema voted no on an exception to Senate rules in January that would have allowed Democrats in the Senate to move forward on a bundle of measures aimed at standardizing elections and reinvigorating the Voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas Gov .\nGreg Abbott signed SB 1 into law in September .\n\u201c I was naive .\nThat \u2019 s all I can say .\nI was naive , \u201d Crockett told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c And we will feel the effects of the inaction of the US Senate , sadly enough , in my opinion , potentially for generations to come.\n\u201d Texas already had some of the strictest voting laws in the nation , but this cycle , the new constraints are a reminder of the failure on the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparities that exist depending on the state you live in .\nFor Democrats and Republicans , this has become a campaign issue as well as a civil rights one , and it \u2019 s featuring heavily in Texas now .\n\u201c Greg Abbott \u2019 s voter suppression law is working as intended , and it \u2019 s wreaking havoc on our elections , \u201d said a fundraising email from Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s campaign sent out last weekend .\n\u201c This is not a drill .\nCongress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting rights .\nThe Supreme Court won \u2019 t either.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not just Democrats who are raising concerns with SB1 .\nAcross the state , nonpartisan election officials have been scrambling to educate voters of all of the changes SB1 put in place .\nOf the nearly 36,000 mail ballot applications processed as of Feb. 21 by Harris County , which encompasses Houston and is the state \u2019 s most populous county , more than 5,000 , or approximately 14 % , were rejected specifically because of the new ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communications for Harris County elections .\nBy Feb. 21 , 2018 , the last comparable midterm election year , only 7 % were rejected for any reason at all .\nThe cutoff to apply to vote by mail was last week , but the actual ballots are still being returned .\nAs of Feb. 22 , more than 7,100 of the 23,393 mail ballots the county had processed had been sent back for a correction related to the new ID laws .\nOne of the ways the new measures have tripped voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identification number that matches one of the numbers on their registration record\u2014 the problem , according to Shah , is that there can still be mismatches if , for example , a voter uses a valid identification number that isn \u2019 t on file .\nAnother issue is that on the mail ballots many voters have entirely missed the field where they are to include an identification number , which is tucked underneath the flap of the carrier envelope .\nIn response , the county sent information to local news outlets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The county also expanded its call center , which has received more than 8,000 calls this year , almost 5,000 of which have been about mail ballot applications and ballots .\nThat \u2019 s higher than the monthly call volume that the county received leading up to the November 2020 and 2021 elections .\n\u201c There really isn \u2019 t a lot of time to educate the general public about these changes to the law .\nWe didn \u2019 t really know what the impact was going to be until we started receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rejections based on these new ID requirements , \u201d Shah told BuzzFeed News , noting that Harris County , because of its size , has the luxury of resources that other counties in the state do not .\nAccording to the Texas Secretary of State \u2019 s office , the vast majority of voters have both their license or state ID number and last four digits of their Social Security number on file .\nApproximately 700,000 voters only have one identification number in their registration record , and 100,000 don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SB1 legislation would uphold election integrity , which there was no prior reason to doubt .\nDemocrats and voting access advocates argued that the law would disproportionately affect marginalized voters .\nThe legislation , in addition to the new ID requirements , also included an expansive set of measures that targeted things like in-person drive-thru voting .\n\u201c SB 1 was put into effect immediately after passage .\nThere \u2019 s been very little time to adapt to the requirements or for the legal challenges to play out , \u201d said Sarah Labowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACLU of Texas .\n\u201c Not only is it bad law , but it \u2019 s bad practice to rush these changes into effect , and we \u2019 re seeing the consequences of that right now.\n\u201d Meanwhile , voting access advocates are lamenting how federal voting rights legislation could have bypassed the situation entirely .\n\u201c We all understood without this federal backstop \u2026 states could really run amuck .\nSo that \u2019 s the emphasis on our end , \u201d said a House Democratic staffer who worked on the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at a collection of laws being introduced by state legislatures , and that is what the bill was meant to respond to , as well as what we saw with the Big Lie , and the stolen election , and just everything put together.\n\u201d Since 2013 , when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act , certain states , like Texas , have had broader discretion in changing their voting laws .\nBy giving the Voting Rights Act teeth again through federal voting rights legislation , the state law could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal legislation had passed relative to the Texas bill , there would have been different ways to challenge the state bill as a whole .\nWhile it takes time to implement legislation in its entirety , the federal legislation would also have contradicted parts of SB1 .\nAmong the provisions of the federal legislation Sinema , Manchin , and Republicans blocked were expanded access to vote by mail , and a measure that would have prohibited a state from denying an absentee ballot due to an error or omission related to identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the voter \u2019 s eligibility to cast a ballot .\nOther aspects of the federal legislation would also have helped modernize Texas \u2019 election infrastructure over time .\nFor example , the state only allows online voter registration when updating a driver \u2019 s license .\nUnder the federal voting rights legislation that Congress could have passed , the state would have been required to implement it more broadly .\nAt least for now , a legislative change to SB1 is not on the horizon , on the state or federal level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple lawsuits , from groups like the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project , as well as the Department of Justice .\nAccording to Sam Taylor , a spokesperson at the Office of the Texas Secretary of State , most of those lawsuits remain in preliminary stages .\nThe White House did not provide comment when asked by BuzzFeed News whether the administration seeking additional places to take further action with regard to SB1 , or whether President Joe Biden would like to see the DOJ investigate in light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me , suffice it to say , things aren \u2019 t the way they should be , \u201d said Texas State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer , who , like Crockett , was an architect in Texas Democrats \u2019 stalling SB1 by walking out of the state .\n\u201c And it \u2019 s a shame .\n\u201d",

Jasmine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term currently running for a seat in Congress , said there \u2019 s \u201c no question \u201d that Texans would have an easier time now if Congress had passed federal voting rights legislation .\nCrockett and dozens of her fellow Democrats left the state and traveled to DC in the summer of 2021 , where their absence from the Texas legislature stalled the state \u2019 s voting measures , known as Senate Bill 1 .\nWhile in Washington , where Democrats control the White House and narrowly hold both chambers of Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect voting rights as a backstop to Republican-led efforts on the state level , meeting with elected officials from Vice President Kamala Harris to Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin .\nJust a few months later , hope for that legislation is nearly nonexistent , after all 50 Republican senators , Manchin , and Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema voted no on an exception to Senate rules in January that would have allowed Democrats in the Senate to move forward on a bundle of measures aimed at standardizing elections and reinvigorating the Voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas Gov .\nGreg Abbott signed SB 1 into law in September .\n\u201c I was naive .\nThat \u2019 s all I can say .\nI was naive , \u201d Crockett told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c And we will feel the effects of the inaction of the US Senate , sadly enough , in my opinion , potentially for generations to come.\n\u201d Texas already had some of the strictest voting laws in the nation , but this cycle , the new constraints are a reminder of the failure on the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparities that exist depending on the state you live in .\nFor Democrats and Republicans , this has become a campaign issue as well as a civil rights one , and it \u2019 s featuring heavily in Texas now .\n\u201c Greg Abbott \u2019 s voter suppression law is working as intended , and it \u2019 s wreaking havoc on our elections , \u201d said a fundraising email from Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s campaign sent out last weekend .\n\u201c This is not a drill .\nCongress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting rights .\nThe Supreme Court won \u2019 t either.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not just Democrats who are raising concerns with SB1 .\nAcross the state , nonpartisan election officials have been scrambling to educate voters of all of the changes SB1 put in place .\nOf the nearly 36,000 mail ballot applications processed as of Feb. 21 by Harris County , which encompasses Houston and is the state \u2019 s most populous county , more than 5,000 , or approximately 14 % , were rejected specifically because of the new ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communications for Harris County elections .\nBy Feb. 21 , 2018 , the last comparable midterm election year , only 7 % were rejected for any reason at all .\nThe cutoff to apply to vote by mail was last week , but the actual ballots are still being returned .\nAs of Feb. 22 , more than 7,100 of the 23,393 mail ballots the county had processed had been sent back for a correction related to the new ID laws .\nOne of the ways the new measures have tripped voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identification number that matches one of the numbers on their registration record\u2014 the problem , according to Shah , is that there can still be mismatches if , for example , a voter uses a valid identification number that isn \u2019 t on file .\nAnother issue is that on the mail ballots many voters have entirely missed the field where they are to include an identification number , which is tucked underneath the flap of the carrier envelope .\nIn response , the county sent information to local news outlets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The county also expanded its call center , which has received more than 8,000 calls this year , almost 5,000 of which have been about mail ballot applications and ballots .\nThat \u2019 s higher than the monthly call volume that the county received leading up to the November 2020 and 2021 elections .\n\u201c There really isn \u2019 t a lot of time to educate the general public about these changes to the law .\nWe didn \u2019 t really know what the impact was going to be until we started receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rejections based on these new ID requirements , \u201d Shah told BuzzFeed News , noting that Harris County , because of its size , has the luxury of resources that other counties in the state do not .\nAccording to the Texas Secretary of State \u2019 s office , the vast majority of voters have both their license or state ID number and last four digits of their Social Security number on file .\nApproximately 700,000 voters only have one identification number in their registration record , and 100,000 don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SB1 legislation would uphold election integrity , which there was no prior reason to doubt .\nDemocrats and voting access advocates argued that the law would disproportionately affect marginalized voters .\nThe legislation , in addition to the new ID requirements , also included an expansive set of measures that targeted things like in-person drive-thru voting .\n\u201c SB 1 was put into effect immediately after passage .\nThere \u2019 s been very little time to adapt to the requirements or for the legal challenges to play out , \u201d said Sarah Labowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACLU of Texas .\n\u201c Not only is it bad law , but it \u2019 s bad practice to rush these changes into effect , and we \u2019 re seeing the consequences of that right now.\n\u201d Meanwhile , voting access advocates are lamenting how federal voting rights legislation could have bypassed the situation entirely .\n\u201c We all understood without this federal backstop \u2026 states could really run amuck .\nSo that \u2019 s the emphasis on our end , \u201d said a House Democratic staffer who worked on the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at a collection of laws being introduced by state legislatures , and that is what the bill was meant to respond to , as well as what we saw with the Big Lie , and the stolen election , and just everything put together.\n\u201d Since 2013 , when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act , certain states , like Texas , have had broader discretion in changing their voting laws .\nBy giving the Voting Rights Act teeth again through federal voting rights legislation , the state law could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal legislation had passed relative to the Texas bill , there would have been different ways to challenge the state bill as a whole .\nWhile it takes time to implement legislation in its entirety , the federal legislation would also have contradicted parts of SB1 .\nAmong the provisions of the federal legislation Sinema , Manchin , and Republicans blocked were expanded access to vote by mail , and a measure that would have prohibited a state from denying an absentee ballot due to an error or omission related to identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the voter \u2019 s eligibility to cast a ballot .\nOther aspects of the federal legislation would also have helped modernize Texas \u2019 election infrastructure over time .\nFor example , the state only allows online voter registration when updating a driver \u2019 s license .\nUnder the federal voting rights legislation that Congress could have passed , the state would have been required to implement it more broadly .\nAt least for now , a legislative change to SB1 is not on the horizon , on the state or federal level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple lawsuits , from groups like the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project , as well as the Department of Justice .\nAccording to Sam Taylor , a spokesperson at the Office of the Texas Secretary of State , most of those lawsuits remain in preliminary stages .\nThe White House did not provide comment when asked by BuzzFeed News whether the administration seeking additional places to take further action with regard to SB1 , or whether President Joe Biden would like to see the DOJ investigate in light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me , suffice it to say , things aren \u2019 t the way they should be , \u201d said Texas State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer , who , like Crockett , was an architect in Texas Democrats \u2019 stalling SB1 by walking out of the state .\n\u201c And it \u2019 s a shame .\n\u201d",

        "content": "Julie Crum and her 91-year-old mother , Darlyne Crum , residents of Canyon Lake , Texas , first filled out applications for mail-in ballots in January , which they qualify for in the state because they are both over the age of 65 .\nThe applications were rejected \u2014 they accidentally hadn \u2019 t specified which party \u2019 s primary they wanted to vote in .\nSo they filled out the forms again .\nJulie got her ballot after that , but her mother \u2019 s application was rejected a second time because of an issue with her ID number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with BuzzFeed News , was dated Feb. 12 , but Julie says her mother didn \u2019 t receive it until Feb. 16 , two days before the mail-in ballot application deadline .\nOnce again , the form was corrected and sent back , but they were worried the application hadn \u2019 t made it in time to meet the deadline .\nJulie said her mother would be able to vote in person if she absolutely had to .\n\u201c But it \u2019 s more than a little infuriating that she would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who votes regularly .\nJulie said it \u2019 s never been this difficult for her and her mother to vote .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t plan on all this taking so much time and energy , so I \u2019 m kind of working it out as we go.\n\u201d Darlyne \u2019 s ballot arrived in the mail Thursday , just five days before Texas \u2019 s primary election , and they \u2019 re \u201c pretty confident \u201d their votes will be counted .\nBut their frustration and struggles aren \u2019 t unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been returned to voters ahead of the March 1 primaries with no guarantee that they \u2019 ll be sent back in time to be counted .\nThe dilemma results from a new law that has effectively tightened access to the ballot for eligible voters , just as the law \u2019 s critics feared .\nTexas , the state that kicks off this year \u2019 s primary season , was one of several states that made a push for more restrictive voter laws following the 2020 elections , despite the fact that elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have widespread voter fraud .\nNow Texans are running into the realities of those measures , from trouble successfully applying for mail-in ballots to having their actual ballots rejected because of ID number issues .\nVoting rights advocates have pointed to the state as an example of what \u2019 s at stake for voters across the country without federal protections .\n\u201c What we are seeing in Texas now is , I think , a preview of what we \u2019 re going to see in other states later this year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Slattery , a senior staff attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project , a group that is serving as counsel in one of the multiple legal challenges against the law .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no reason to think that one or two dozen other states that passed similar legislation won \u2019 t face similar meltdowns when their time comes .\nIf you live in one of the states , this is a warning sign to you that a potentially massive problem \u2019 s coming your way.\n\u201d Texas state Rep. Jasmine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term currently running for a seat in Congress , said there \u2019 s \u201c no question \u201d that Texans would have an easier time now if Congress had passed federal voting rights legislation .\nCrockett and dozens of her fellow Democrats left the state and traveled to DC in summer 2021 , where their absence from the Texas legislature stalled the state \u2019 s voting measures , known as Senate Bill 1 .\nWhile in Washington , where Democrats control the White House and narrowly hold both chambers of Congress , they lobbied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights as a backstop to Republican-led efforts on the state level , meeting with elected officials from Vice President Kamala Harris to Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin .\nJust a few months later , hope for that legislation is nearly nonexistent , after all 50 Republican senators , Manchin , and Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema voted no on an exception to Senate rules in January that would have allowed Democrats in the Senate to move forward on a bundle of measures aimed at standardizing elections and reinvigorating the Voting Rights Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nGreg Abbott signed SB 1 into law in September .\n\u201c I was naive .\nThat \u2019 s all I can say .\nI was naive , \u201d Crockett told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c And we will feel the effects of the inaction of the US Senate , sadly enough , in my opinion , potentially for generations to come.\n\u201d Texas already had some of the strictest voting laws in the nation , but this cycle , the new constraints are a reminder of the failure on the federal level to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist depending on the state you live in .\nFor Democrats and Republicans , this has become a campaign issue as well as a civil rights one , and it \u2019 s featuring heavily in Texas now .\n\u201c Greg Abbott \u2019 s voter suppression law is working as intended , and it \u2019 s wreaking havoc on our elections , \u201d said a fundraising email from Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s campaign sent out last weekend .\n\u201c This is not a drill .\nCongress has shown it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Supreme Court won \u2019 t either.\n\u201d It \u2019 s not just Democrats who are raising concerns with SB1 .\nAcross the state , nonpartisan election officials have been scrambling to educate voters of all of the changes SB1 put in place .\nOf the nearly 36,000 mail ballot applications processed as of Feb. 21 by Harris County , which encompasses Houston and is the state \u2019 s most populous county , more than 5,000 , or approximately 14 % , were rejected specifically because of the new ID requirements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Harris County elections .\nBy Feb. 21 , 2018 , the last comparable midterm election year , only 7 % were rejected for any reason at all .\nThe cutoff to apply to vote by mail was last week , but the actual ballots are still being returned .\nAs of Feb. 22 , more than 7,100 of the 23,393 mail ballots the county had processed had been sent back for a correction related to the new ID laws .\nOne of the ways the new measures have tripped voters up is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number that matches one of the numbers on their registration record \u2014 the problem , according to Shah , is that there can still be mismatches if , for example , a voter uses a valid identification number that isn \u2019 t on file .\nAnother issue is that on the mail ballots many voters have entirely missed the field where they are to include an identification number , which is tucked underneath the flap of the carrier envelope .\nIn response , the county sent information to local news outlets and posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county also expanded its call center , which has received more than 8,000 calls this year , almost 5,000 of which have been about mail ballot applications and ballots .\nThat \u2019 s higher than the monthly call volume that the county received leading up to the November 2020 and 2021 elections .\n\u201c There really isn \u2019 t a lot of time to educate the general public about these changes to the law .\nWe didn \u2019 t really know what the impact was going to be until we started receiving applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejections based on these new ID requirements , \u201d Shah told BuzzFeed News , noting that Harris County , because of its size , has the luxury of resources that other counties in the state do not .\nAccording to the Texas Secretary of State \u2019 s office , the vast majority of voters have both their license or state ID number and the last four digits of their Social Security number on file .\nApproximately 700,000 voters only have one identification number in their registration record , and 100,000 don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SB1 legislation would uphold election integrity , which there was no prior reason to doubt .\nDemocrats and voting access advocates argued that the law would disproportionately affect marginalized voters .\nThe legislation , in addition to the new ID requirements , also included an expansive set of measures that targeted things like in-person drive-thru voting .\n\u201c SB 1 was put into effect immediately after passage .\nThere \u2019 s been very little time to adapt to the requirements or for the legal challenges to play out , \u201d said Sarah Labowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACLU of Texas .\n\u201c Not only is it bad law , but it \u2019 s bad practice to rush these changes into effect , and we \u2019 re seeing the consequences of that right now.\n\u201d Meanwhile , voting access advocates are lamenting how federal voting rights legislation could have bypassed the situation entirely .\n\u201c We all understood without this federal backstop \u2026 states could really run amuck .\nSo that \u2019 s the emphasis on our end , \u201d said a Democratic staffer in the House who worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were looking at a collection of laws being introduced by state legislatures , and that is what the bill was meant to respond to , as well as what we saw with the Big Lie , and the stolen election , and just everything put together.\n\u201d Since 2013 , when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act , certain states , like Texas , have had broader discretion in changing their voting laws .\nBy giving the Voting Rights Act teeth again through federal voting rights legislation , the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on when the federal legislation had passed relative to the Texas bill , there would have been different ways to challenge the state bill as a whole .\nWhile it takes time to implement legislation in its entirety , the federal legislation would also have contradicted parts of SB1 .\nAmong the provisions of the federal legislation Sinema , Manchin , and Republicans blocked were expanded access to voting by mail , and a measure that would have prohibited a state from denying an absentee ballot due to an error or omission related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t relevant to the voter \u2019 s eligibility to cast a ballot .\nOther aspects of the federal legislation would also have helped modernize Texas \u2019 s election infrastructure over time .\nFor example , the state only allows online voter registration when updating a driver \u2019 s license .\nUnder the federal voting rights legislation that Congress could have passed , the state would have been required to implement it more broadly .\nAt least for now , a legislative change to SB1 is not on the horizon , on the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target of multiple lawsuits , from groups like the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project , as well as the Department of Justice .\nAccording to Sam Taylor , a spokesperson at the Office of the Texas Secretary of State , most of those lawsuits remain in preliminary stages .\nThe White House did not provide comment when asked by BuzzFeed News whether the administration seeking additional places to take further action with regard to SB1 , or whether President Joe Biden would like to see the DOJ investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary .\n\u201c To me , suffice it to say , things aren \u2019 t the way they should be , \u201d said Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer , who , like Crockett , was an architect in Texas Democrats \u2019 stalling SB1 by walking out of the state .\n\u201c And it \u2019 s a shame .\n\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Every person who appeared in court Monday as a prospective juror in the first Jan. 6 trial knew something about the Capitol attack , if only that it happened .\nBut that wasn \u2019 t enough to get them sent home .\nInstead , the judge and the lawyers spent hours painstakingly parsing exactly what they knew , where they got their information from , and how strongly they felt about it .\nBy the end of the day , 25 people had made it through the first round of questioning to potentially serve as a juror in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wylie , Texas , man is facing a five-count indictment , including charges that he brought a rifle and a handgun to Washington with the intention of supporting a \u201c civil disorder \u201d and that he brought the latter with him to the Capitol .\nJudges so far have rejected efforts by a small number of defendants charged with storming the Capitol , including Reffitt , to move trials out of Washington , DC .\nIn lodging attacks on the location , defense attorneys have cited the city \u2019 s high percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media coverage , and a pair of recent surveys that attempted to quantify the proportion of residents who already have strong negative opinions about people arrested in connection with Jan. 6 .\nWhile some prospective jurors were struck on Monday after telling the judge that they couldn \u2019 t set aside the strong opinions they had about Jan. 6 , more than half of the 34 people questioned went forward without an initial objection .\nUS District Judge Dabney Friedrich noted at the start of the day that Reffitt \u2019 s case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurors likely would know about the underlying events .\nThe \u201c critical question , \u201d she said , was to figure out if a person had \u201c such fixed opinions \u201d about the attack on the Capitol that they couldn \u2019 t be an impartial judge of whether Reffitt , as an individual , was innocent or guilty of the charges against him .\nSome prospective jurors described seeking out information about the investigation in the months after the riot .\nOthers described passively absorbing coverage related to Jan. 6 when they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather or as they scanned headlines in the newspaper or online .\nMost listed national news outlets like the Washington Post and CNN as their main sources of information about Jan. 6 , and expressed disapproval about what happened at the Capitol , some stronger than others .\nOne woman name-dropped right-wing commentator Julie Kelly as one of her primary sources of information , explaining that she liked to listen to podcasts .\nThe woman said she had opinions about Jan. 6 and the people who participated , but didn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 d be able to set those opinions aside as a juror .\nShe said she was taken \u201c off guard \u201d when she learned what the trial was about , saying she \u2019 d come into court expecting to hear a \u201c fender bender \u201d case .\nShe stayed in the pool .\nMost people said they didn \u2019 t recognize Reffitt .\nThe only defendant in the Jan. 6 prosecutions to receive a repeat nod was Jacob Chansley , who is serving a 41-month prison sentence after taking a plea deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at various times as the \u201c QAnon shaman , \u201d a nickname often used to describe him in media reports , as well as \u201c the guy with the horns , \u201d a reference to the costume that Chansley was photographed wearing that day .\nWhen prospective jurors were asked if they knew Reffitt , he \u2019 d briefly remove his mask and smile , according to pool reports from the courtroom .\nFriedrich has restricted in-person access for the public and the press , instead having the court stream audio or video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room .\nBefore jury questioning started , the judge partially denied a motion filed by a media coalition ( including BuzzFeed News ) seeking to secure at least one seat in the courtroom for a pool reporter ; the judge will allow it for jury selection , opening presentations , and possibly closing arguments , but not the rest of the trial .\nOne of the few prospective jurors who said they were familiar with Reffitt was a public relations consultant who said he worked with journalists covering the investigation .\nThe man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t think that he could separate from his strong negative feelings about Jan. 6 , but also that the nature of his work meant it \u2019 d be hard for him to avoid reading news and consuming outside information .\nHe also said that he later learned that he knew a person involved in organizing the \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally before the riot and that his opinion of that person was \u201c not a favorable one.\n\u201d The PR consultant was struck at the request of Reffitt \u2019 s lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Risa Berkower pushed back a few times on Welch \u2019 s requests to strike jurors , highlighting comments they \u2019 d made that suggested they \u2019 d try to follow the judge \u2019 s orders even if they expressed strong opinions about Jan. 6 .\nOther candidates who were removed from the pool included : \u2022 None a man who told the judge that he believed everyone who went into the Capitol was guilty and \u201c should be prosecuted to the max.\n\u201d \u2022 None a woman who identified liberal MSNBC host Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said she would struggle to follow the judge \u2019 s instruction to set aside her opinions .\n\u2022 None a man who described the attack as \u201c beyond the pale \u201d and said he would come in leaning towards the government .\n\u2022 None a former Department of Homeland Security spokesperson who said he followed reporters who were covering Jan. 6 and didn \u2019 t think he could overcome his \u201c bias.\n\u201d A few candidates who made it through the first day of questioning had political connections .\nOne man explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. Brad Schneider and had spoken with Schneider about his experience on Jan. 6 being huddled with police at the Capitol .\nThe man said that he thought he could set aside his views on what happened , however .\nAnother prospective juror shared that his stepmother had served in the Trump administration as an ambassador , first to Canada and then the United Nations , a description that matched Kelly Craft .\nCraft was in the UN post when the Capitol was attacked , but the man said he \u2019 d never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reportedly considering a gubernatorial bid in Kentucky .\nThe man described his father as a \u201c major donor \u201d to former president Donald Trump and other Republican candidates , and identified companies that his father had worked for that matched publicly available information about Craft \u2019 s husband , Joe Craft III .\nAsked by the prosecutor if he \u2019 d be welcome at family events if he were chosen for the jury and voted to convict Reffitt , the man laughed and said yes , that regardless of political affiliation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serving their country , and that would include jury service .\nThe pool featured a concentration of lawyers and people who worked for the federal government or had a connection through a family member \u2014 an unsurprising situation given the location .\nSome of the other potential jurors who made it through the first round included : \u2022 None a Department of Defense employee who said he tried to get information about \u201c different sides \u201d from various sources , listing CNN , Fox , and Yahoo as examples .\n\u2022 None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a real news guy \u201d and explained that he hadn \u2019 t kept up with information related to Jan. 6 in part because he spent significant time at another home in Aruba .\n\u2022 None a woman who recalled stories she \u2019 d heard about US Capitol Police officers affected by Jan. 6 , but who said she believed she could be impartial .\n\u2022 None a corporate lawyer for Amazon who \u2019 d received a tentative offer to work at the Justice Department in the Civil Division but who told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more inclined to side with the federal prosecutors .\n\u2022 None an attorney who called the events of Jan. 6 \u201c pretty atrocious \u201d and \u201c frightening \u201d but expressed confidence that she could set aside those beliefs ; she also volunteered that she \u2019 d once lived in a Trump-branded property and worked at a law firm that handled bankruptcy matters related to Trump , but said she didn \u2019 t think that would affect her ability to be on the jury .\nThe day ended with a few question marks .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Virginia while looking for a new home in DC ; the judge wasn \u2019 t clear if that disqualified her and put off making a decision .\nA woman who said her church choir was counting on her participation on Ash Wednesday later in the week and who had upcoming travel plans to visit family stayed in the pool for now , but the judge indicated they \u2019 d only seat her on the jury as a last resort .\nFriedrich said she hoped to move to opening statements by Tuesday afternoon @",

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nYou don \u2019 t have to be a serious athlete or fitness buff to appreciate a massage gun .\nSure , their intention is to release tight muscles and increase mobility , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore from sleeping on the wrong pillow or your hips are tight after a long hike .\nAnd a muscle massager is less expensive than going to see a massage therapist .\nTony Gentilcore , cofounder of high-performance training facility Cressey Sports Performance and a certified strength and conditioning specialist , said that the convenience of using a massage gun is a great perk .\n\u201c People who work out , who are training , they are going to get sore and a massage gun gives them easy access to soft tissue therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel or pay the price of a massage therapist.\n\u201d Massage guns offer a different sort of therapy than you \u2019 d normally get from a massage or physical therapist , even ones who specialize in sports .\nThese massage guns offer a percussive massage treatment , which combines elements of traditional massage and vibration therapy , Leada Malek , a licensed physical therapist and board-certified sports specialist with her own virtual practice , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Massage can reduce tension in muscles and impact flexibility by reducing muscle stiffness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d she said .\n\u201c With the massage gun , the idea is that you combine those treatments to prepare for activity and/or prime for recovery.\n\u201d Gentilcore said that massage guns can temporarily improve your range of motion , but those improvements aren \u2019 t going to stick unless you also incorporate other methods to help maintain that new range .\nMuscle massagers generally provide transient , short-term benefits , though that \u2019 s really all they \u2019 re intended to provide , he said .\nIn a small 2020 study in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , researchers looked at the effect of five minutes of handheld percussive massage on the calf muscles of 16 healthy men who were recreational athletes .\nThey found that there was an increase in the range of motion similar to what you would get with a conventional massage .\nMassage in general ( using hands rather than a massage gun ) has been associated with small improvements in flexibility and delayed onset muscle soreness .\nHow and when to use a muscle massager Laura Pachnos , a senior coach at Solidcore in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor in vinyasa yoga , spin , and Pilates , recommends using a massage gun if your muscles feel tight when you wake up or before a workout .\nShe incorporates it into her own stretching routine , especially after heavy lifting days .\n\u201c Basically if you \u2019 re feeling like you need it , do it , \u201d Pachnos said .\nThough they \u2019 re a great option for loosening up tight muscles , Malek advises against using massage guns on any acute injury or areas of inflammation , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid using them on a bony prominence , which is any part of the body where the bone is directly under the skin without a padding of fat or muscle .\nShe suggested staying away from bony points and smaller joints altogether , and using the softest attachment anywhere that feels tender .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re feeling more soreness or pain or bruising , you definitely overdid it , \u201d said Malek .\nWhich massage gun should you get ?\nPersonally , Malek likes massage guns that beat at a higher-than-average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , beats at 16 millimeters of amplitude and 40 beats per second , while other less expensive options may not have comparable motors so they \u2019 re working at a different level of impact .\nThat intensity is her preference , but she did note that a slightly weaker motor likely won \u2019 t alter the effects dramatically .\nOne thing she did

        "content": "The former judge hired by Wisconsin Republicans to conduct an \u201c investigation \u201d into the 2020 election presented his \u201c interim \u201d findings on Tuesday and asserted that there were \u201c significant grounds \u201d for the state legislature to \u201c decertify \u201d the election \u2014 something that legal experts across Wisconsin and the country agree is not possible or appropriate .\nThe judge , Michael Gableman , spoke for more than three hours before the Assembly \u2019 s Committee on Campaigns and Elections in a presentation that featured videos of a lawyer pressing Americans in nursing homes on their capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members and allegations of a broad conspiracy by Democrats , state and local elections officials , and Jewish billionaires to defeat former president Donald Trump .\nIn the hearing and an accompanying 136-page interim report , Gableman did not definitively assert that the election was stolen but instead relied on a lot of inference and suggestion .\nThe report \u2019 s introduction acknowledges as much , noting that it \u201c draws no conclusions about specific , unauthorized outside interference or insider threats to machine voting , but it does provide numerous examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors to operate in the shadows.\n\u201d \u201c Absent access to [ election ] systems , it would not be unfair for any citizens to conclude the worst , however , \u201d the report continues .\nGableman said he has been unable to complete his investigation and report , despite seven months of work and $ 676,000 in taxpayer money , because he has not been able to get \u201c any substantive witness \u201d to cooperate .\nHe said Tuesday that his office is involved in nine lawsuits challenging his subpoenas for interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment .\nGableman , who spoke at a Trump rally a few days after the 2020 election and suggested that the vote was stolen , insisted that his investigation was not a partisan effort , though he did acknowledge that he voted for Trump .\nThe former state supreme court justice has engaged with pro-Trump election deniers during his investigation , including attending MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell \u2019 s \u201c Cyber Symposium \u201d and visiting the Republican-led audit in Arizona .\nTrump encouraged \u201c everyone who loves America \u201d to watch the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gableman as \u201c highly respected.\n\u201d His spokesperson Liz Harrington live-tweeted much of the hearing , echoing Gableman \u2019 s call to \u201c decertify.\n\u201d Tuesday \u2019 s presentation centered largely on two popular conspiracy theories among the pro-Trump right .\nThe first revolves around donations that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made to the Center for Tech and Civic Life \u2014 a nonprofit organization that helped local jurisdictions across the US conduct an election during the middle of a pandemic ; the false suggestion is that Zuckerberg and billionaire George Soros bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with Wisconsin residents in nursing homes who allegedly voted in 2020 , but whose children don \u2019 t believe they had the capacity to do so .\nIn defense of the latter theory , Gableman presented a series of video interviews in which a lawyer on his team either pressed older Americans in nursing homes on whether they understand how elections work or interviewed their adult children about their mental capacity while they sat silently in the background .\nNursing home residents who were interviewed personally were also asked whether they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to raise taxes to create government health insurance , apparently as a test of their capacity to have voted .\nOne woman in a brief clip did say that she was forced to vote , but Gableman did not elaborate .\nThe report states definitively that \u201c rampant fraud and abuse occurred statewide at Wisconsin \u2019 s nursing homes , \u201d but suggests that the state conduct an audit to determine its scope .\nAs the Democratic chair of Wisconsin \u2019 s bipartisan Elections Commission noted on Twitter , only a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if their competency is in question .\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 abolished literacy tests by ensuring that being able to \u201c demonstrate the ability to read , write , understand , or interpret any matter \u201d could not be a prerequisite to voting or registering to vote .\nRep. Jodi Emerson , a Democrat on the Campaigns and Elections Committee , got a bit emotional as she told Gableman that she had a family member who was going into memory care this week .\n\u201c I would say that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a video today , they would appear very different than they were in November of 2020 , \u201d she said .\nEmerson added that her relative \u2019 s immediate family members have different political opinions than they do .\nLater in the hearing , Gableman struggled to answer questions from Republican Rep. Donna Rozar about how , if there was systemic voter fraud , Republicans down-ballot still won their elections and actually got more votes than Trump did .\n\u201c If we do n't legitimize the win at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in jeopardy that we won ?\nI do n't know if that 's a legitimate question or not , but then , do I have to worry that maybe I did n't win because there was some funky stuff going on or shenanigans ?\n\u201d she asked .\nGableman said he wasn \u2019 t able to get into that kind of \u201c granular \u201d detail , in part because elections officials didn \u2019 t answer his subpoenas .\nGableman \u2019 s suggestion that the Wisconsin legislature \u201c decertify \u201d the 2020 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his allies \u2014 comes after a Wisconsin Assembly Republican tried and failed to do so just a month ago .\nWisconsin Rep. Timothy Ramthun \u2019 s decertification bill did not get a vote in the Assembly and was sent by Republican leadership to committee to die .\nRamthun \u2019 s bill did succeed , however , in getting the attention of Trump who is reportedly backing Ramthun \u2019 s campaign for governor .\nAssembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke , a Republican who is retiring at the end of the year , tweeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to stop any effort , to put politicians in charge of deciding who wins or loses elections.\n\u201d Speaker Robin Vos , who hired Gableman , did not respond to a request for comment .\nWhen Vos first started the 2020 election investigation , under intense pressure from Trump and his supporters , he insisted that its focus wasn \u2019 t on trying to undo the 2020 election , but on providing a rationale for passing election reforms through the legislature this year .\nGableman \u2019 s report , however , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. Mark Spreitzer noted during the hearing , Vos passed a few election-related bills last week \u2014 which would not survive a veto from Democratic Gov .\nTony Evers \u2014 and the Assembly is unlikely to meet again this session .\nGableman told legislators Tuesday that he is planning to continue his investigation , but that the status of his contract with Vos is \u201c complicated \u201d and they are \u201c going back and forth on the terms and the scope of the continued contract.\n\u201d Vos did not respond to a request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that I do have a continuing contract through the rendering of services , \u201d Gableman said .\n\u201c Others take the position that my authority ran out at the end of December of \u2018 21.\n\u201d Evers called Gableman \u2019 s investigation \u201c an increasingly dangerous and ongoing threat to our democracy \u201d in a statement .\n\u201c Any mere condemnation of this effort rings hollow \u2014 it has to end .\nEnough is enough .\nRepublicans in the Legislature have always had the ability to end this effort , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , \u201d he said .\nBut Gableman said that he plans to continue his investigation with or without legislative backing , telling lawmakers , \u201c I 'm going to keep going and whether anyone signs a contract or not , I can do it on my own .\n\u201d",

''\nICE detainees like Josmith , who due to preexisting medical conditions are at greater risk of serious side effects from contracting COVID-19 , can be released under a federal court injunction issued in 2020 .\nAmid soaring COVID rates , a judge at the time ordered authorities to identify all ICE detainees who are at higher risk of severe illness and death and to strongly consider releasing them unless they posed a danger to property or people .\nIn an Oct. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , US District Judge Jesus Bernal said that \u201c only in rare cases \u201d would ICE fail to release at-risk immigrants who are not subject to mandatory detention .\nHundreds of immigrants have since been released .\nBut as the pandemic progressed , attorneys and advocates said immigrants like Josmith fell through the cracks .\nIn order to get some medically vulnerable people released , attorneys had to pressure ICE , but advocates said that \u2019 s not a solution for detainees who don \u2019 t have access to legal representation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who agreed to be identified for this story only by his first name , said he filed more than a dozen requests to see a doctor about his asthma , but they were ignored .\nHe was able to finally see a doctor in early February after nearly collapsing from a lack of oxygen .\nMedical staffers at Cibola County Correctional Center , which is operated for ICE by the private prison company CoreCivic , told Josmith he had high blood pressure .\nHe was given medication and told he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that never happened .\nOn Feb. 7 , three days after he collapsed , he was given an inhaler to treat his asthma , ICE said .\nHis lawyer , Zoe Bowman from Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center , said that despite his medical condition , ICE refused to release him under the court order .\nWhat may have contributed to Josmith \u2019 s struggle to be released is that he didn \u2019 t initially tell immigration officials that he had asthma .\nBowman said Josmith later tried to tell medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor that were all ignored .\nIn an attempt to get Josmith released , Bowman had also submitted a copy and certified translation of his asthma diagnosis from Haiti .\n\u201c Having asthma is a clear-cut and straight reason for him to be released , \u201d Bowman said .\nBowman noted that she \u2019 s had to send multiple emails to ICE and make phone calls to push for the release of immigrants with high-risk medical conditions who \u2019 ve been in detention for months .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order as it should , \u201d she said .\n\u201c There are very few pro bono lawyers serving thousands of ICE beds , and it feels like we \u2019 re only coming across these cases by chance.\n\u201d When Bowman asked ICE about the multiple medical requests Josmith submitted , the agency told her it had n't received any since November .\n\u201c It seems like this bizarre situation where the official records aren \u2019 t matching what \u2019 s happening inside detention , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The lack of medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations for people who are detained there for months and months.\n\u201d Josmith was released from Cibola County Correctional Center on Feb. 16 after the agency received an inquiry about his status from BuzzFeed News .\nIn a statement , an ICE official said Josmith had been given an Albuterol inhaler on Feb. 7 and released on Feb. 16 .\nHe was released on an alternative to detention program , ICE said , which uses technology and case management to track immigrants outside of detention .\n`` ICE continues to evaluate individuals based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who might be at higher risk for severe illness as a result of COVID-19 to determine whether continued detention was appropriate , '' the immigration enforcement agency said .\nICE said Josmith had been ordered removed by an immigration judge , but filed a pending appeal on Jan. 14 .\nMatthew Davio , a spokesperson for Corecivic , in a statement said the company cares deeply about every person in their care .\nAll of their immigration facilities are monitored closely by ICE and are required to undergo regular reviews , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health services team follows CoreCivic 's standards for medical care and ICE 's Performance Based National Detention Standards , Davio said .\nCorecivic , Davio said , does n't have a role or influence over the release process for medically vulnerable immigrants because of COVID-19 .\n`` Our staff are trained and held to the highest ethical standards .\nOur commitment to keeping those entrusted to our care safe and secure is our top priority , '' Davio said .\n`` We vehemently deny any allegations of detainee mistreatment .

dedicated detention unit for transgender immigrants , which was housed at the Cibola County Correctional Center .\nThe report also found that quarantine procedures were poorly enforced and that detainees with mental illnesses and chronic diseases received deficient treatment .\nThese problems led to the temporary closure and transfer of transgender women to other ICE facilities .\nA secret memo sent by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICE leadership obtained by BuzzFeed News , revealed how immigrants at Cibola County Correctional Center sometimes waited up to 17 days for urgently needed medical care , were exposed to poor sanitation and quarantine practices during a chickenpox and mumps outbreak , and didn \u2019 t get medications as directed by a doctor for illnesses such as diabetes , epilepsy ,

average daily population for the facility has been about 83 since November .\nHowever , the UCLA School of Law \u2019 s COVID Behind Bars Data Project , which is tracking infections among detainees

        "title": "Joe Biden Cautiously Announced A More Optimistic Outlook On The Pandemic",
        "content": "As the world enters a third year of the COVID-19 pandemic , President Joe Biden said the US is \u201c moving forward safely \u201d in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night , painting a picture of cautious optimism about dealing with the virus in the coming months .\n\u201c I know some are talking about \u2018 living with COVID-19.\n\u2019 Tonight , I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19 , \u201d he said , delivering his address in a chamber full of lawmakers not wearing masks after masking requirements on Capitol Hill were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its guidelines strongly recommending masks indoors for most of the country .\nNationally , COVID cases are slowing down after the massive surge driven by the Omicron variant through the past few months , with the exceptions of pockets of the country with low vaccination rates , where cases and hospitalizations largely remain higher .\nAnd despite the progress that \u2019 s been made , roughly 1,800 Americans are still dying of the virus every day .\nThough he stopped short of declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crisis where COVID-19 could be considered endemic , Biden sought to emphasize returning to somewhat normal life .\n\u201c COVID-19 need no longer control our lives , \u201d he said .\nThe White House is expected to release a new plan on Wednesday morning outlining the next phase of the COVID-19 response .\nThat will follow the general blueprint Biden laid out on Tuesday night , according to a White House official .\nThe president made four points on the next phase of the pandemic : continuing to encourage vaccines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for new variants , getting people back to schools and workplaces , and providing vaccines for other parts of the world .\n\u201c For the past six to eight weeks we \u2019 ve been meeting with outside public health officials , governors , and getting all of their inputs , \u201d said the White House official , adding that the strategy will include protections for immunocompromised people , like ensuring they can receive a fourth shot of the vaccine and plans to prevent mass closures of offices and schools in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to provide antiviral drugs on the spot \u2014 1 million pills in March and double that in April \u2014 to people who test positive at hundreds of pharmacy clinics and supermarket pharmacies across the country .\nBiden was both more positive and more measured on the pandemic than in his first address to Congress , perhaps a reflection on the ups and downs of the past year , which saw an improvement in cases and hospitalizations over the summer and a drastic turn for the worse through fall and winter .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omicron variant , the White House came under criticism from some public health experts for its slow rollout of rapid tests and N95 masks .\nBiden said on Tuesday the administration expects to be ready to send out new vaccines within 100 days if a new variant emerges that requires one .\nHe added that he hopes to have stockpiles of tests , masks , and antiviral pills if Congress approves funding .\n\u201c I can not promise a new variant won \u2019 t come , but I can promise you we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready if it does , \u201d he said .\nSome public health experts say Biden \u2019 s shift toward trying to ease some COVID-19 guidelines makes sense in practical terms because case rates are going down in many parts of the country , and they believe the places with the lowest masking compliance are unlikely to be swayed either way by what the federal government recommends .\nIn previous addresses to the nation on the pandemic , Biden took the opportunity to speak directly to those Americans who have resisted getting vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to hit that message less directly : \u201c We know how incredibly effective vaccines are .\nIf you \u2019 re

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The jury is set for the first Jan. 6 trial , with 16 Washington , DC , residents seated to decide the fate of a Texas man charged with participating in the riot , bringing a handgun to the US Capitol , and threatening his children afterward to not cooperate with law enforcement .\nJury selection in the case of Guy Reffitt took two days , with the judge , prosecutors , and Reffitt \u2019 s lawyer sifting through 56 prospective jurors , drilling down on what they already knew about the events of Jan. 6 and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge noted on the first day , simply knowing about the attack on the Capitol wasn \u2019 t enough to get removed from the pool ; she was looking for whether people had \u201c fixed opinions \u201d that could get in the way of impartially weighing the evidence .\nThe 16 people chosen for the jury \u2014 nine men and seven women \u2014 includes four alternates .\nEvery person who was brought in for questioning on Tuesday knew something about Jan. 6 , similar to Monday \u2019 s proceedings .\nSome had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others had continued to track updates about the investigation .\nNearly everyone said they had some opinion about the attack , generally negative , but most said they didn \u2019 t know anything about Reffitt specifically and could set their feelings aside and base a decision solely on the evidence presented in court .\nFor some summoned Washingtonians , though , their opinions proved too strong .\nOn Tuesday , one man appeared visibly angry , sitting with his arms crossed as he explained that when he learned the case was related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Guilty.\n\u201d The man brought up the involvement of the QAnon collective delusion and the antisemitic sentiments that are part of that , and said that his mother is Jewish .\nHe said he found it hard to follow the judge \u2019 s questions because he was so upset to be in the same room as the defendant .\nThere was no disagreement between the prosecutors and Reffitt \u2019 s lawyer that he should be struck .\nOne man who described seeing news coverage about Reffitt and the allegations against him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had said that he thought he could set aside what he knew , but Friedrich said that she \u2019 d indicated at the start that she \u2019 d draw a line at anyone who already knew details about Reffitt \u2019 s case .\nTwo prospective jurors who appeared on Tuesday worked for the Architect of the Capitol ; one made it through to the next round of vetting while the other did not .\nThe first man said he was a woodcrafter and had been with the Architect \u2019 s office for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaving that job in a week because it \u201c wasn \u2019 t my cup of tea.\n\u201d He said his position didn \u2019 t cause him to favor the government going in , and that he hadn \u2019 t been involved in repairs related to damage to the building on Jan. 6 .\nThere was no request to strike him right away , and he ended up being chosen for the jury .\nThe second man had worked for the Architect of the Capitol for six years , most recently at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol complex ; he hadn \u2019 t worked directly on repairs related to the attack but said that it had delayed a project by two months .\nHe said he worked closely with the US Capitol Police and knew an officer who had been assaulted on Jan. 6 and suffered physical and emotional trauma .\nHe said it would be difficult to set aside what he knew about the attack and his feelings , but thought he could do it .\nWelch didn \u2019 t ask to strike the man from the pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to surprise the judge .\nAfter a later private discussion with the lawyers , though , Friedrich announced that he \u2019 d been removed .\nHaving a different political ideology from many of former president Donald Trump \u2019 s supporters wasn \u2019 t grounds for immediate exclusion .\nOne man said that he \u2019 d participated in Black Lives Matter protests in recent years , and was at Lafayette Square in downtown Washington for a demonstration on June 1 , 2020 , when police violently cleared the area ; Trump walked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo op at a nearby church .\nThe man said that he didn \u2019 t have a generally negative view of police in light of that experience , but believed there were \u201c systemic \u201d issues with how law enforcement operated .\nThe man said he was \u201c horrified \u201d and \u201c ashamed \u201d by what happened on Jan. 6 , but also felt that he could evaluate the case of an individual in an unbiased way .\nReffitt \u2019 s lawyer William Welch III asked if the man could set aside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defendant \u2019 s beliefs \u201c offensive.\n\u201d The man said that he could because he understood that in court what mattered were a person \u2019 s actions , not their beliefs .\nWelch did not ask Friedrich to strike him at the time , but he ultimately was n't chosen for the jury .\nOne woman who expressed deep anxiety about the prospect of serving as a juror and having someone \u2019 s freedom in her hands also told the judge that a friend had recently discussed Reffitt \u2019 s case with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of , \u201c His ass needs to go to jail , he did that.\n\u201d The prosecutor and Welch were united in asking the judge to strike her from the pool .\nEarlier in the day , Assistant US Attorney Risa Berkower brought up a woman who was questioned on Monday and said that she \u2019 d gotten much of her information about Jan. 6 from conservative commentator Julie Kelly .\nBerkower said they \u2019 d learned since then that Kelly had promoted the conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 attack was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the government , and wanted to know if they could question the woman further about whether she had a bias against the government .\nFriedrich said no , that Berkower had a chance to ask questions the day before and that the government could use one of its strikes .\nThe woman was not selected for the jury .\nThe jurors who were chosen included : \u2022 None a Department of Defense employee who listed CNN and Fox as his sources of news about Jan. 6 \u2022 None a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the events of Jan. 6 but said she felt less \u201c uneasy \u201d now and was confident she could put aside her feelings \u2022 None a retiree who said he had minimal knowledge of Jan. 6 because he is \u201c not a real news guy \u201d \u2022 None a woman who recalled seeing stories of US Capitol Police officers who were affected but few other details \u2022 None a scientist and naturalized US citizen born in England who said she thought at first that people who went to the Capitol were exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that people involved in \u201c physical \u201d conduct like attacking police and climbing walls went \u201c beyond free speech , \u201d but felt \u201c very confident \u201d she could follow the judge \u2019 s instructions to set aside her views \u2022 None a software company employee who said he believed Jan. 6 was \u201c exceedingly negative \u201d for democracy but also believed in people being innocent until proven guilty and understood that the government bore the burden of proof The prosecution is expected to deliver its opening statement to the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedrich expressed some concern about the use of expletives in the government \u2019 s presentation , explaining that she didn \u2019 t want to \u201c inflame \u201d the jury from the start , while also saying that any evidence of what Reffitt said could come into the trial .\nThe prosecutor said he could replace certain letters with asterisks in the government \u2019 s visual aids , but got the OK from the judge to recite quotes in their entirety .",

        "content": "The former judge hired by Wisconsin Republicans to conduct an \u201c investigation \u201d into the 2020 election presented his \u201c interim \u201d findings on Tuesday and asserted that there were \u201c significant grounds \u201d for the state legislature to \u201c decertify \u201d the election \u2014 something that legal experts across Wisconsin and the country agree is not possible or appropriate .\nThe judge , Michael Gableman , spoke for more than three hours before the Assembly \u2019 s Committee on Campaigns and Elections in a presentation that featured videos of a lawyer pressing Americans in nursing homes on their capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members and allegations of a broad conspiracy by Democrats , state and local elections officials , and Jewish billionaires to defeat former president Donald Trump .\nIn the hearing and an accompanying 136-page interim report , Gableman did not definitively assert that the election was stolen but instead relied on a lot of inference and suggestion .\nThe report \u2019 s introduction acknowledges as much , noting that it \u201c draws no conclusions about specific , unauthorized outside interference or insider threats to machine voting , but it does provide numerous examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors to operate in the shadows.\n\u201d \u201c Absent access to [ election ] systems , it would not be unfair for any citizens to conclude the worst , however , \u201d the report continues .\nGableman said he has been unable to complete his investigation and report , despite seven months of work and $ 676,000 in taxpayer money , because he has not been able to get \u201c any substantive witness \u201d to cooperate .\nHe said Tuesday that his office is involved in nine lawsuits challenging his subpoenas for interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment .\nGableman , who spoke at a Trump rally a few days after the 2020 election and suggested that the vote was stolen , insisted that his investigation was not a partisan effort , though he did acknowledge that he voted for Trump .\nThe former state supreme court justice has engaged with pro-Trump election deniers during his investigation , including attending MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell \u2019 s \u201c Cyber Symposium \u201d and visiting the Republican-led audit in Arizona .\nTrump encouraged \u201c everyone who loves America \u201d to watch the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gableman as \u201c highly respected.\n\u201d His spokesperson Liz Harrington live-tweeted much of the hearing , echoing Gableman \u2019 s call to \u201c decertify.\n\u201d Tuesday \u2019 s presentation centered largely on two popular conspiracy theories among the pro-Trump right .\nThe first revolves around donations that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made to the Center for Tech and Civic Life \u2014 a nonprofit organization that helped local jurisdictions across the US conduct an election during the middle of a pandemic ; the false suggestion is that Zuckerberg and billionaire George Soros bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with Wisconsin residents in nursing homes who allegedly voted in 2020 , but whose children don \u2019 t believe they had the capacity to do so .\nIn defense of the latter theory , Gableman presented a series of video interviews in which a lawyer on his team either pressed older Americans in nursing homes on whether they understand how elections work or interviewed their adult children about their mental capacity while they sat silently in the background .\nNursing home residents who were interviewed personally were also asked whether they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to raise taxes to create government health insurance , apparently as a test of their capacity to have voted .\nOne woman in a brief clip did say that she was forced to vote , but Gableman did not elaborate .\nThe report states definitively that \u201c rampant fraud and abuse occurred statewide at Wisconsin \u2019 s nursing homes , \u201d but suggests that the state conduct an audit to determine its scope .\nAs the Democratic chair of Wisconsin \u2019 s bipartisan Elections Commission noted on Twitter , only a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if their competency is in question .\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 abolished literacy tests by ensuring that being able to \u201c demonstrate the ability to read , write , understand , or interpret any matter \u201d could not be a prerequisite to voting or registering to vote .\nRep. Jodi Emerson , a Democrat on the Campaigns and Elections Committee , got a bit emotional as she told Gableman that she had a family member who was going into memory care this week .\n\u201c I would say that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a video today , they would appear very different than they were in November of 2020 , \u201d she said .\nEmerson added that her relative \u2019 s immediate family members have different political opinions than they do .\nLater in the hearing , Gableman struggled to answer questions from Republican Rep. Donna Rozar about how , if there was systemic voter fraud , Republicans down-ballot still won their elections and actually got more votes than Trump did .\n\u201c If we do n't legitimize the win at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in jeopardy that we won ?\nI do n't know if that 's a legitimate question or not , but then , do I have to worry that maybe I did n't win because there was some funky stuff going on or shenanigans ?\n\u201d she asked .\nGableman said he wasn \u2019 t able to get into that kind of \u201c granular \u201d detail , in part because elections officials didn \u2019 t answer his subpoenas .\nGableman \u2019 s suggestion that the Wisconsin legislature \u201c decertify \u201d the 2020 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his allies \u2014 comes after a Wisconsin Assembly Republican tried and failed to do so just a month ago .\nWisconsin Rep. Timothy Ramthun \u2019 s decertification bill did not get a vote in the Assembly and was sent by Republican leadership to committee to die .\nRamthun \u2019 s bill did succeed , however , in getting the attention of Trump who is reportedly backing Ramthun \u2019 s campaign for governor .\nAssembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke , a Republican who is retiring at the end of the year , tweeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to stop any effort , to put politicians in charge of deciding who wins or loses elections.\n\u201d Speaker Robin Vos , who hired Gableman , did not respond to a request for comment .\nWhen Vos first started the 2020 election investigation , under intense pressure from Trump and his supporters , he insisted that its focus wasn \u2019 t on trying to undo the 2020 election , but on providing a rationale for passing election reforms through the legislature this year .\nGableman \u2019 s report , however , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. Mark Spreitzer noted during the hearing , Vos passed a few election-related bills last week \u2014 which would not survive a veto from Democratic Gov .\nTony Evers \u2014 and the Assembly is unlikely to meet again this session .\nGableman told legislators Tuesday that he is planning to continue his investigation , but that the status of his contract with Vos is \u201c complicated \u201d and they are \u201c going back and forth on the terms and the scope of the continued contract.\n\u201d Vos did not respond to a request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that I do have a continuing contract through the rendering of services , \u201d Gableman said .\n\u201c Others take the position that my authority ran out at the end of December of \u2018 21.\n\u201d Evers called Gableman \u2019 s investigation \u201c an increasingly dangerous and ongoing threat to our democracy \u201d in a statement .\n\u201c Any mere condemnation of this effort rings hollow \u2014 it has to end .\nEnough is enough .\nRepublicans in the Legislature have always had the ability to end this effort , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , \u201d he said .\nBut Gableman said he plans to continue his investigation with or without legislative backing , telling lawmakers , \u201c I 'm going to keep going and whether anyone signs a contract or not , I can do it on my own .\n\u201d",

''\nHis then-18-year-old son submitted a tip to the FBI about his father in December 2020 .\nAfter Reffitt returned to Texas , Nestler told the jury that Reffitt grew worried about being watched , and warned his son and his then-16-year-old daughter that if they turned him in they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c traitors get shot.\n\u201d The son recorded his father talking about Jan. 6 , and the jury would hear that , Nestler said .\nReffitt \u2019 s alleged discussions with his children are the subject of one of the charges he faces for obstructing the investigation .\nReffitt \u2019 s lawyer , William Welch III , delivered a brief opening statement to the jury .\nHe began by focusing on the lack of evidence that Reffitt had assaulted anyone , saying his client also never tried to disarm officers and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reffitt was armed at the time .\nWelch acknowledged Reffitt was told to move back and was hit by the various projectiles , but said his time on the steps ended up being brief .\nWelch said Reffitt was a person who bragged and exaggerated , and who used \u201c a lot of hyperbole \u201d that made other people upset .\nIn the afternoon , the jury heard from the government \u2019 s first witness , former US Capitol Police officer Shauni Kerkhoff , who was one of the handful of officers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a set of stairs on the west side of the Capitol .\nKerkhoff said she was part of the \u201c less than lethal \u201d team of the Capitol Police \u2019 s Civil Disturbance Unit , and served as a \u201c grenadier , \u201d which meant she handled projectile launchers .\nOn Jan. 6. , she said she was carrying a pepperball launcher .\nKerkhoff said that as the riot unfolded , she was on the east side of the Capitol and was called to the west side ; she said she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building but it was locked down , which meant they had run around outside .\nBy the time Kerkhoff arrived on the west side , the crowd had breached a security perimeter that police set up using metal bike racks and appeared \u201c violent , \u201d she said .\nThe officers were outnumbered and she was concerned , she said .\nAsked by Nestler to elaborate , she replied : \u201c We were the only thing standing between thousands of these people and the Congress.\n\u201d The jury saw videos of Kerkhoff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blue jacket and a helmet that the government identified as Reffitt .\nIn Capitol surveillance footage that started at around 1:47 p.m. , according to a timestamp , the man is seen at the front of the crowd on the steps ; the video didn \u2019 t have sound , which is generally the case for Capitol surveillance videos .\nIn the footage , the man is seen slowly progressing up the stairway , taking a step forward and then pausing .\nHe \u2019 s standing on the railing .\nKerkhoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop , and when he didn \u2019 t , she deployed an estimated 40-50 pepperballs , aiming for his chest , shins , and thighs , which didn \u2019 t seem to have an effect .\nIn the video , the man is seen pointing at the officers and gesturing to the crowd ; he is holding a megaphone .\nWhen the pepperballs didn \u2019 t work , another officer used a different \u201c less than lethal \u201d weapon that launched projectiles designed to cause more \u201c pain compliance , \u201d Kerkhoff explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man .\nIn the video , an officer deploys a canister of chemical spray , and the man pauses , putting his hand up and his head down .\nHe takes at least one more step up before pausing again and rubbing his face .\nHe makes a sweeping motion with his arm toward the crowd ; Kerkhoff says he was waving to the mob to go past him .\nAn officer then uses an even larger canister of chemical spray , and members of the crowd appear to pull down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs as a cover .\nNestler played audio of radio dispatches from Capitol Police officers , including Kerkhoff .\nAsked to describe her voice at the time , Kerkhoff said she was \u201c panicked.\n\u201d She is heard asking for backup , saying , \u201c They \u2019 re coming up the stairs .\nThey \u2019 re coming up the stairs on the west side.\n\u201d Another male voice is heard yelling , \u201c We need every single unit on the upper west terrace right now.\n\u201d Videos with later timestamps appeared to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the mob removed the tarp that covered scaffolding on one side of the stairs and moved through the scaffolding to get to the top of the stairs and push past police .\nNestler played a video that Kerkhoff said showed Reffitt taking off his helmet , and , sometime later , moving up the steps with the crowd , pausing at one point to wash out his eyes .\nIn an even later video , the man is seen walking down the stairs away from the Capitol .\nThe second witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Capitol Police Inspector Monique Moore , a 24-year veteran of the force who was in the command center on Jan. 6 .\nNestler played a compilation of surveillance camera footage showing how the mob breached different areas of the Capitol throughout the afternoon and had Moore narrate .\nEarly in her testimony , Moore started crying and had to pause to compose herself when Nestler asked her about the mood in the command center .\nShe said she and others were in \u201c disbelief \u201d and that it was hard to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was her job to make sure they had the resources to get out .",

''\nHis then-18-year-old son submitted a tip to the FBI about his father in December 2020 .\nAfter Reffitt returned to Texas , Nestler told the jury that Reffitt grew worried about being watched , and warned his son and his then-16-year-old daughter that if they turned him in they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c traitors get shot.\n\u201d The son recorded his father talking about Jan. 6 , and the jury would hear that , Nestler said .\nReffitt \u2019 s alleged discussions with his children are the subject of one of the charges he faces for obstructing the investigation .\nReffitt \u2019 s lawyer , William Welch III , delivered a brief opening statement to the jury .\nHe began by focusing on the lack of evidence that Reffitt had assaulted anyone , saying his client also never tried to disarm officers and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reffitt was armed at the time .\nWelch acknowledged Reffitt was told to move back and was hit by the various projectiles , but said his time on the steps ended up being brief .\nWelch said Reffitt was a person who bragged and exaggerated , and who used \u201c a lot of hyperbole \u201d that made other people upset .\nIn the afternoon , the jury heard from the government \u2019 s first witness , former US Capitol Police officer Shauni Kerkhoff , who was one of the handful of officers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a set of stairs on the west side of the Capitol .\nKerkhoff said she was part of the \u201c less than lethal \u201d team of the Capitol Police \u2019 s Civil Disturbance Unit , and served as a \u201c grenadier , \u201d which meant she handled projectile launchers .\nOn Jan. 6. , she said she was carrying a pepperball launcher .\nKerkhoff said that as the riot unfolded , she was on the east side of the Capitol and was called to the west side ; she said she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building but it was locked down , which meant they had run around outside .\nBy the time Kerkhoff arrived on the west side , the crowd had breached a security perimeter that police set up using metal bike racks and appeared \u201c violent , \u201d she said .\nThe officers were outnumbered and she was concerned , she said .\nAsked by Nestler to elaborate , she replied : \u201c We were the only thing standing between thousands of these people and the Congress.\n\u201d The jury saw videos of Kerkhoff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blue jacket and a helmet that the government identified as Reffitt .\nIn Capitol surveillance footage that started at around 1:47 p.m. , according to a timestamp , the man is seen at the front of the crowd on the steps ; the video didn \u2019 t have sound , which is generally the case for Capitol surveillance videos .\nIn the footage , the man is seen slowly progressing up the stairway , taking a step forward and then pausing .\nHe \u2019 s standing on the railing .\nKerkhoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop , and when he didn \u2019 t , she deployed an estimated 40-50 pepperballs , aiming for his chest , shins , and thighs , which didn \u2019 t seem to have an effect .\nIn the video , the man is seen pointing at the officers and gesturing to the crowd ; he is holding a megaphone .\nWhen the pepperballs didn \u2019 t work , another officer used a different \u201c less than lethal \u201d weapon that launched projectiles designed to cause more \u201c pain compliance , \u201d Kerkhoff explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man .\nIn the video , an officer deploys a canister of chemical spray , and the man pauses , putting his hand up and his head down .\nHe takes at least one more step up before pausing again and rubbing his face .\nHe makes a sweeping motion with his arm toward the crowd ; Kerkhoff says he was waving to the mob to go past him .\nAn officer then uses an even larger canister of chemical spray , and members of the crowd appear to pull down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs as a cover .\nNestler played audio of radio dispatches from Capitol Police officers , including Kerkhoff .\nAsked to describe her voice at the time , Kerkhoff said she was \u201c panicked.\n\u201d She is heard asking for backup , saying , \u201c They \u2019 re coming up the stairs .\nThey \u2019 re coming up the stairs on the west side.\n\u201d Another male voice is heard yelling , \u201c We need every single unit on the upper west terrace right now.\n\u201d Videos with later timestamps appeared to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the mob removed the tarp that covered scaffolding on one side of the stairs and moved through the scaffolding to get to the top of the stairs and push past police .\nNestler played a video that Kerkhoff said showed Reffitt taking off his helmet , and , sometime later , moving up the steps with the crowd , pausing at one point to wash out his eyes .\nIn an even later video , the man is seen walking down the stairs away from the Capitol .\nThe second witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Capitol Police Inspector Monique Moore , a 24-year veteran of the force who was in the command center on Jan. 6 .\nNestler played a compilation of surveillance camera footage showing how the mob breached different areas of the Capitol throughout the afternoon and had Moore narrate .\nEarly in her testimony , Moore started crying and had to pause to compose herself when Nestler asked her about the mood in the command center .\nShe said she and others were in \u201c disbelief \u201d and that it was hard to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was her job to make sure they had the resources to get out .",

        "title": "Joe Biden Cautiously Announced A More Optimistic Outlook On The Pandemic",
        "content": "As the world enters a third year of the COVID-19 pandemic , President Joe Biden said the US is \u201c moving forward safely \u201d in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night , painting a picture of cautious optimism about dealing with the virus in the coming months .\n\u201c I know some are talking about \u2018 living with COVID-19.\n\u2019 Tonight , I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19 , \u201d he said , delivering his address in a chamber full of lawmakers not wearing masks after masking requirements on Capitol Hill were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its guidelines strongly recommending masks indoors for most of the country .\nNationally , COVID cases are slowing down after the massive surge driven by the Omicron variant through the past few months , with the exceptions of pockets of the country with low vaccination rates , where cases and hospitalizations largely remain higher .\nAnd despite the progress that \u2019 s been made , roughly 1,800 Americans are still dying of the virus every day .\nThough he stopped short of declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crisis where COVID-19 could be considered endemic , Biden sought to emphasize returning to somewhat normal life .\n\u201c COVID-19 need no longer control our lives , \u201d he said .\nThe White House is expected to release a new plan on Wednesday morning outlining the next phase of the COVID-19 response .\nThat will follow the general blueprint Biden laid out on Tuesday night , according to a White House official .\nThe president made four points on the next phase of the pandemic : continuing to encourage vaccines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing for new variants , getting people back to schools and workplaces , and providing vaccines for other parts of the world .\n\u201c For the past six to eight weeks we \u2019 ve been meeting with outside public health officials , governors , and getting all of their inputs , \u201d said the White House official , adding that the strategy will include protections for immunocompromised people , like ensuring they can receive a fourth shot of the vaccine and plans to prevent mass closures of offices and schools in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to provide antiviral drugs on the spot \u2014 1 million pills in March and double that in April \u2014 to people who test positive at hundreds of pharmacy clinics and supermarket pharmacies across the country .\nBiden was both more positive and more measured on the pandemic than in his first address to Congress , perhaps a reflection on the ups and downs of the past year , which saw an improvement in cases and hospitalizations over the summer and a drastic turn for the worse through fall and winter .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omicron variant , the White House came under criticism from some public health experts for its slow rollout of rapid tests and N95 masks .\nBiden said on Tuesday the administration expects to be ready to send out new vaccines within 100 days if a new variant emerges that requires one .\nHe added that he hopes to have stockpiles of tests , masks , and antiviral pills if Congress approves funding .\n\u201c I can not promise a new variant won \u2019 t come , but I can promise you we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready if it does , \u201d he said .\nSome public health experts say Biden \u2019 s shift toward trying to ease some COVID-19 guidelines makes sense in practical terms because case rates are going down in many parts of the country , and they believe the places with the lowest masking compliance are unlikely to be swayed either way by what the federal government recommends .\nIn previous addresses to the nation on the pandemic , Biden took the opportunity to speak directly to those Americans who have resisted getting vaccinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to hit that message less directly : \u201c We know how incredibly effective vaccines are .\nIf you \u2019 re vaccinated and boosted , you have the highest degree of protection .\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans , \u201d he said , and added that the virus should not be \u201c a partisan dividing line.\n\u201d Matthew Seeger , a health and risk communication scholar at Wayne State University , said that reaching those Americans is going to take more than a message from Biden or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in official sources and scientific authorities among unvaccinated Americans .\n\u201c I think that that is a much longer-term problem , \u201d he said .\nDr. Jennifer Nuzzo , a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , said it was important for Biden to set expectations that things could change and that restrictions could come back into place if necessary .\nShe added that one thing that has been missing from public discourse \u2014 which Biden did not allude to on Tuesday night \u2014 is getting people used to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where pandemics are just more likely to happen and preparing for that , rather than seeing this as a once-in-a-lifetime event .\n\u201c I think masks remain an important tool , and I think that we should continue to avail ourselves of the benefits of masks , \u201d Nuzzo said .\n\u201c But I think the fact of the matter is , the places where I worry about most in the country are places that have n't been masking by way of mandate since August .\n\u201d",

        "content": "Donald Trump is not an incumbent .\nBut Republican leaders will have to decide if they 're going to treat the most influential member of their party that way should he announce a third presidential bid .\nIf Trump decides to run , the Republican National Committee , state and county chairs , and fundraisers will be left to determine whether the leader of their party \u2014 who isn \u2019 t currently president \u2014 should , in fact , be treated as an incumbent president .\nTrump \u2019 s popularity , his influence on the base , and yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Republican president to hold office will make structuring an equitable primary complicated .\n`` I mean , we do see him as an incumbent , \u201d Republican Indian River County Chair Jay Kramer told BuzzFeed News .\nThe county , Florida \u2019 s seventh wealthiest ( and among the top 5 % wealthiest per capita in the nation ) , encompasses Vero Beach and attracts an affluent donor base .\n\u201c I mean , you know , Trump , for the most part when it comes to fundraising , I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy , '' he added .\nThis problem isn \u2019 t isolated to Trump \u2019 s home state .\nIf he runs \u2060\u2014 and he has consistently suggested he will , including at CPAC last weekend\u2060 \u2014 Republican officials nationwide will have to navigate the first Republican presidential campaign from a former president in more than a century .\nThe RNC continuing to pay a portion of Trump \u2019 s legal fees a year after he left office indicates how close Trump and the Republican brand remain .\nBut this week , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate would have equal access to its resources , including a $ 350 million voter file database the organization has been cultivating since 2012 .\n\u201c We will remain neutral , \u201d an RNC spokesperson said .\nA spokesperson for Trump did not comment on the party 's posture for this story .\nRepublican chairs in Iowa and New Hampshire are in a particularly complicated position , as their first-in-the-nation status weighs heavily on their process \u2019 s fairness .\nAs it stands , Iowa holds the first caucus in the election cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary .\n\u201c I 've already made the public statement : The Iowa Republican Party is neutral , \u201d Iowa State Chair Jeff Kaufmann told BuzzFeed News during a phone interview .\n\u201c Now does that mean I 'm not going to stand up for the former president and his policies ?\nAbsolutely , I will .\nI will , you know , speak and introduce him and say wonderful things at a Trump rally , but at the same time , I spent an entire day with Tom Cotton going up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials BuzzFeed News spoke with described the problems of neutrality and incumbency as unusual with a lot of moving parts \u2014 complications that parties have not faced much since the 1970s , given the low number of two-term presidents .\nFor instance , if Trump were to declare and there was only one other candidate who is not actively campaigning , that would be a different situation than a more traditional field of several senators or governors campaigning in the early states .\nFor New Hampshire chair Stephen Stepanek , who dubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodstock for political junkies , \u201d fairness means \u201c everyone is given a level playing field \u201d even if they are relatively unknown and not well-funded .\nHe said he expects all candidates to participate in the state \u2019 s famous \u201c dinners \u201d that draw voters to more intimate settings , much like the time he said he saw George W. Bush with 30 other people in a firehouse in Milford , New Hampshire .\nStepanek said Trump will be given the \u201c respect of the former president \u201d and expects certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service protection for him .\n\u201c But other than that , he will be treated as any other candidate for the Republican nomination here in New Hampshire.\n\u201d Still , some members of the RNC recognize that there are people in the organization who could favor Trump .\nAnd even though he \u2019 s not the president , Republicans who oppose Trump risk a public chastising from the former president or , at best , a passive scolding from a fellow colleague .\n\u201c I have been advocating for fairness , fairness all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juliana Bergeron told BuzzFeed News .\nBergeron was one of a minority of RNC members who voted against censuring Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger last month during the RNC winter meeting in Salt Lake City .\n\u201c And I 've been told by a couple of other members on the RNC that you know , the way I voted on a couple of things , that \u2018 the president wo n't like that.\n\u2019 My question was : \u2018 Which president ?\n\u2019 \u201c You know , it was one thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was the incumbent , but now he 's not the incumbent , \u201d Bergeron added .\n\u201c So we have to welcome every single candidate who wants to come to New Hampshire and be fair.\n\u201d In Alabama , which has been one of the states to vote on the packed early primary Super Tuesday , fairness for the party means equal access to any events and potential promotional items the state party sponsors .\n\u201c Obviously , Alabama has a special relationship with Donald Trump , \u201d Alabama GOP Chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People in Alabama love him .\nI think he would easily win our primary , but we would treat \u2014 the Republican Party \u2014 would treat all candidates equally in the primary .\n\u201d",

        "content": "In July 2020 , Gold shot to prominence as the founder of America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors , which announced itself at a \u201c White Coat Summit \u201d held in Washington , DC .\nThe group initially pushed for an end to COVID lockdown measures and promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the disease .\nBy then , the FDA had revoked an initial emergency authorization for the drug \u2019 s use as a COVID treatment , after clinical trial results showed it was unlikely to be effective .\nThe agency had earlier warned of reports that hydroxychloroquine could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some patients .\nBilling itself as a \u201c civil rights organization , \u201d Gold \u2019 s group is linked to the Tea Party Patriots , a right-wing activist group , and has launched legal challenges to vaccine mandates .\nShe has downplayed the severity of COVID and questioned the effectiveness of vaccines .\n\u201c The people who die from COVID-19 are people who are kinda destined to die in this period anyway , \u201d Gold said at a speech in Florida posted online in January 2021 , claiming that the \u201c so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On its website , America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors promotes telemedicine appointments costing $ 90 with doctors who will prescribe \u201c early treatment \u201d for COVID with drugs including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 neither of which have been proven to be effective .\nIn September 2021 , the Intercept revealed that data provided by a hacker indicated that America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors and its telemedicine partner , SpeakWithAnMD.com , had received at least $ 6.7 million for these consultations .\nThe House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis then launched an investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions from America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors and SpeakWithAnMD.com .\nWriting to Gold in October , the committee \u2019 s Democratic chair , Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina , said he was concerned her group is \u201c endangering American lives \u201d and has \u201c profited from these abusive practices.\n\u201d America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors did not respond to requests for comment on its telemedicine and other activities .\nA representative of SpeakWithAnMD.com told BuzzFeed News by email that the company had no comment .\nEven before news of these telemedicine activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disinformation , a group of doctors , parents , and disability advocates , had filed complaints with state medical boards against Gold and other physicians affiliated with America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors , calling for their licenses to practice medicine to be suspended or revoked for spreading false information about COVID .\nThese complaints gained little traction .\nIn July 2021 , after filing a complaint relating to Gold \u2019 s involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection and alleging that she \u201c is pushing COVID19 vaccine disinformation , \u201d Nick Sawyer , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive director of No License for Disinformation , was told : \u201c Your complaint does not indicate there is a physician-patient relationship in California over which the Board would have jurisdiction to investigate and subpoena documents and witnesses.\n\u201d Last month , a bill that would specifically designate the \u201c promotion of misinformation or disinformation \u201d on COVID as unprofessional conduct providing grounds for medical disciplinary action was introduced into the California legislature .\nIf passed , it would give the state medical board clear jurisdiction to pursue such cases .\nIn December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical board to take action against Gold and other physicians associated with America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors , the medical board \u2019 s president , Kristina Lawson , said that she had been \u201c ambushed \u201d in a parking garage by a group of men with a camera and microphone , identifying themselves as members of America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors .\nDescribing the incident as a \u201c terrifying experience , \u201d Lawson wrote on Twitter that there had been no request for an interview : \u201c Instead , they ambushed me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be alone .\nThe private investigator traveling with them told law enforcement they are producing a video about me that will include footage of my house and neighborhood , and , of course , me.\n\u201d \u201c As soon as they confronted me in the parking garage I realized they had jumped out of the same car that had been at the end of my driveway earlier that day , \u201d Lawson told BuzzFeed News by email .\n\u201c I called 911 right away.\n\u201d Clips from this encounter , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a trailer for the video production Doc Tracy : Physician Investigator .\nAs first reported by the Intercept , signing up for updates on the video on the America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors website triggers an automated email that states the group \u201c is on a mission to expose the Mandate Mafia who are trying to hustle all of us.\n\u201d It adds : \u201c They \u2019 re going to cry crocodile tears like Kristina Lawson did.\n\u201d In a press release issued on March 16 , America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was \u2018 ambushed \u2019 are utterly unfounded.\n\u201d The release also stated that the group intends to file a defamation suit against the Intercept , claiming the publication had falsely labeled the group \u201c disinformation doctors \u201d and that it had run a hit piece \u201c designed to interfere \u201d with Gold \u2019 s medical license .\n`` For this undercover series , we adhered to the highest ethical standards to uncover egregious wrongdoing by the medical establishment , \u201d the release said .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t comment on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but legal threats will not deter us from continuing to report on America \u2019 s Frontline Doctors , \u201d Betsy Reed , editor-in-chief of the Intercept , said in a statement .\nAmerica \u2019 s Frontline Doctors and Gold did not respond to requests for further comment from BuzzFeed News .\nGold \u2019 s license to practice medicine in California remains current and there is no record of any disciplinary action by the medical board .\nThe Medical Board of California said it could not comment on specific investigations , which are confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official legal complaint .\n\u201c The Board is aware of the reports that have appeared in news media outlets and social media sites concerning Dr. Gold , and is looking into them , \u201d spokesperson Carlos Villatoro told BuzzFeed News by email .\n\u201c The Board has no further information to provide at this time.\n\u201d Criminal convictions can lead to subsequent disciplinary action from state medical boards .\nHowever , Gold \u2019 s guilty plea over her actions in the Jan. 6 insurrection may not trigger action against her medical license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code states that \u201c the conviction of any offense substantially related to the qualifications , functions , or duties of a physician constitutes unprofessional conduct which can be cause for disciplinary action.\n\u201d Whether or not an offense is \u201c substantially related \u201d to a doctor \u2019 s medical practice is considered on a case-by-case basis .\nSawyer , the executive director of No License for Disinformation , said the California medical board should act against Gold irrespective of her guilty plea .\n\u201c Even without her involvement with the Jan. 6 insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of men to harass the president of the California state medical board , we thought she should be disciplined , \u201d Sawyer told BuzzFeed News .",

        "content": "The party on Eldridge Street could hardly be contained : Bodies spilled out of the front door onto the sidewalk , and joyous screams echoed from the roof .\nInside , under the wood beams of the $ 7.5 million carriage house , a DJ played techno for a young and queer crowd .\nAmid throngs of twentysomethings who were pierced and shorn in unusual places , a performance artist named Crackhead Barney roamed around in a Trump mask , breasts bared , past a man painted green from head to toe , wearing only a jockstrap and an alligator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOver the sound of a jazz band , the screams were now clearer : \u201c This is being paid for by Peter Thiel !\n\u201d At the center of the pandemonium was a young artist from Miami named Trevor Bazile .\nDressed inconspicuously in a baggy hoodie and jeans , he raced from conversation to conversation , stopping along the way to pluck at a stand-up bass and then to bounce around an art installation set inside a children \u2019 s blow-up castle .\nA chaotic mix of short films , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dance parties , NPCC brought together respected independent filmmakers , hard-right software developers , leftist DJs , and queer performance artists .\nIt built buzz through a new downtown media scene that revolves around a handful of interlocking podcasts with provocative politics .\n( The hosts of Red Scare , the most popular of those shows , interviewed legendary cult filmmaker John Waters on NPCC \u2019 s first night . )\nThe fest \u2019 s aesthetic was one of deliberate bad taste \u2014 official T-shirts depicted the Statue of Liberty dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Worst Is Yet to Come.\n\u201d But in 2022 , bad taste carries a political charge .\nThe NPCC acquired a derisive nickname during its planning : the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d In part , that \u2019 s because rumors of right-wing funding swirled around the festival in the months leading up to it .\nBut the label reflects something trickier to define , a broader sense that there is a core of young artists and trendsetters in New York and Los Angeles who , post-Trump , are rediscovering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you must , a vibe shift : a new generation of internet-native tastemakers \u2014 like many of the people crowded into Bazile \u2019 s party \u2014 who find the moralistic gatekeeping of millennials all a bit pass\u00e9 .\nA youthful subculture that rejects liberal pieties naturally excites the American right .\nIt \u2019 s a sign of the pendulum swinging , a chance to break the culture war stalemate of the Trump years .\nThiel , who did not comment for this story , has called identity politics an \u201c insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weakens the United States .\nAn investment in a culture of cool that declares \u201c wokeness \u201d unfashionable , like an investment in politicians who attack the teaching of critical race theory in schools or an investment that steers kids away from college , is a way of disconnecting the next generation from the power grid of contemporary liberalism .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of disruption .\nBut the allure of such a shift stretches beyond MAGA Republicans .\nThere \u2019 s a diverse coalition of Americans who resent the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled liberals who think aspects of # MeToo and the racial justice movement are excessive or cynically self-promotional , media figures who have built lucrative careers banging on about \u201c cancel culture , \u201d and artists and writers of previous generations who find the current cultural constraints intolerable .\n`` Transgressive organizations like the \u2018 New People \u2019 s Cinema Club \u2019 must survive because they help keep devious ideas near and dear to the hearts of the young , '' Waters wrote in an email .\nSelf-aware and supremely ironic creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwoke \u201d set understand that they are useful to the right and even joke about it .\nBazile knew he had been cast for a part in someone else \u2019 s vision of the future .\nBut he accepted the role because he saw in it the chance to pursue his own radical creative agenda \u2014 a dynamic nearly as old as art patronage itself .\nAfter the NPCC , a meme went around that depicted a large puppet , labeled \u201c Trevor Bazile , \u201d holding a smaller puppet , labeled \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding an even smaller puppet , which was labeled \u201c Peter Thiel.\n\u201d The image has a knowingly absurd implication : that an unknown young filmmaker , of all people , could manipulate an oligarch who is known as a right-wing puppet master .\nBut it also contains a more complex truth .\nFor Bazile , who above all was aware of the way he was being used , Peter Thiel \u2019 s money was an opportunity to build a new space in the rubble of American culture .\nIn 2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repertory movie theater in Los Angeles .\nPlaying a mix of strange , forgotten , and contemporary films , the theater quickly turned into \u201c an epicenter of young Hollywood , \u201d according to Variety .\nThen , in August 2017 , a widely distributed anonymous email accused Belove of \u201c sexual harassment , assault , and abuse by former employees and volunteers.\n\u201d Though he denied the allegations , calling them \u201c demonstrable lies and half-truths , \u201d Belove resigned from Cinefamily days after the email was sent .\nOne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belove was a young film editor named Alex Lee Moyer , who had an idea for a documentary .\nThe film would be about a group of driftless young men who gather on 4chan and Twitter to vent their frustration with their lack of romantic and professional prospects .\nBelove was drawn to the subject matter .\nHe felt that these young men had been swept up in an online moral panic ( this one over \u201c incels \u201d ) and that a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary about their lives would make clear how overblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Moyer with the film , TFW NO GF ( imageboard shorthand for \u201c that feeling when no girlfriend.\n\u201d ) Right-wing politics hovered at the edges of the production ; 3D-printed guns advocate Cody Wilson was an early financial supporter .\nBut the documentary itself is affectless , refraining from any judgment of its subjects .\nIn March 2020 , as Belove and Moyer were preparing to screen the film at the South by Southwest festival , they attended a live taping in Los Angeles of Other Life , a podcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe guest was Curtis Yarvin , a prolific blogger and software developer who first achieved notice under the pseudonym \u201c Mencius Moldbug.\n\u201d Writing as Moldbug from 2007 to 2014 , Yarvin became synonymous with \u201c neoreaction , \u201d an abstruse political philosophy that prefers rational authoritarianism to democracy .\nTo the extent that Yarvin is held to be dangerous rather than offensive or kooky , it is because of the sense that he represents an unexpressed current of antidemocratic belief in Silicon Valley .\nBut when Belove listened to Yarvin speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent bong-hit philosopher .\nCurtis Yarvin \u2019 s relationship with Peter Thiel is both well documented and incompletely understood .\nOn the one hand , Yarvin is close enough with Thiel to have watched the 2016 election at the venture capitalist \u2019 s home and to have taken the billionaire \u2019 s investment capital for his startup , Tlon .\n( He also has emailed about politics with Thiel since at least 2013 . )\nOn the other hand , Thiel has invested in a variety of quixotic ventures , including 3D-printed meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be a mug \u2019 s game to try to disentangle Thiel \u2019 s economic interests from his political commitments from his flights of intellectual fancy from the pet projects of his friends .\nStill , to the degree Thiel embodies Silicon Valley \u2019 s contrarianism , cultural insecurity , and nose for a new market , a \u201c postwoke \u201d film company seemed like a natural fit .\nThiel \u2019 s investments in politics have been high profile and consequential , but his ventures in culture and media \u2014 beyond funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been scattershot .\nIn 2018 , BuzzFeed News revealed that Thiel had considered creating a conservative news network ; nothing came of it .\nHe funded the conservative political journal American Affairs , a contrarian science quarterly , and , according to a recent biography , the \u201c heterodox \u201d website Quillette .\nThe Thiel Foundation subsidiary Imitatio , dedicated to the thought of the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard , once purchased a table at a benefit put on by n+1 , a leftist literary magazine .\nIt \u2019 s unclear exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play Nice Ltd. , which Belove registered in California in September 2020 .\n( According to Belove , there are multiple investors , including others from the tech industry . )\nBut at times , Thiel \u2019 s employees have been closely involved in Belove \u2019 s activities .\nIn July 2021 , Belove screened films and partied at the Cannes Film Festival with Jimmy Kaltreider , the executive director of the Thiel Foundation .\nIn texts , Belove referred to members of Thiel Capital as his \u201c traveling companions \u201d and mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaltreider .\nBy this point , Belove had cycled through several ideas for Play Nice .\nIt could be a seed fund , or a production company , or maybe even a streaming service .\nStill , he was at heart a film programmer , and he loved the idea of a festival .\nIn LA , Belove \u2019 s name was toxic .\nBut he knew New York had a thriving young cultural scene , one nostalgic for an authentic city it never knew but half-remembered through the risk-taking films of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially inspired by the notorious , defunct New York Underground Film Festival , Belove reached out in April 2021 to Ed Halter , its former director .\n\u201c I got funding to support a new york underground film fest bringing together the new dirtbag film scene , \u201d Belove wrote in an email .\n\u201c I want to help expand it .\nWe want to be all over town , pop-ups , secret screenings , no website , text invites like rave [ ... ] real underground.\n\u201d Belove didn \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he knew his name would be a distraction .\nSo who could help him find and mentor the young artists he wanted to attract ?\nBelove had been collaborating on Play Nice with Lucas Leyva , the founder of a well-regarded Miami film collective called the Borscht Corporation .\nAnd Leyva said that he knew an extraordinary person who was just right for the job of creative director .\nTrevor Bazile knew what the culture saw when it looked at him : a \u201c royal flush of identities , \u201d as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Black , he was queer , he didn \u2019 t have money , and he was the child of a Haitian immigrant .\nHe was also , according to nearly everyone who encountered him , some kind of genius .\nIn 2017 , Bazile turned up at Borscht to volunteer and never really left .\nStarted in 2005 by Leyva , Borscht had a well-earned reputation for developing the talents of untrained , often first-generation American filmmakers .\nOscar-winning director Barry Jenkins made a short film for Borscht , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d without the collective .\nAs Borscht built its name , it drew investment from major institutional supporters of the arts , including the Knight Foundation , Time Warner , and the Andy Warhol Foundation .\nBy the time Bazile arrived , Borscht was already an established draw for eccentric young artists .\nInspired by the idea of an authentic culture in a city known for its superficial glitz , Borscht fellows were a mix of posh kids with prestigious arts training and local kids from working-class families .\n( The program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s grandson . )\nIt was an exciting , combustible combination .\nBazile stood out immediately .\n\u201c His brain was glow-in-the-dark , special , \u201d Leyva said .\n\u201c He thought differently from anyone else.\n\u201d Bazile made formally inventive , jazz-inflected short films , but also sculptures and installations .\nHe would sleep in the Borscht space , located in an old mall in downtown Miami , and it became a second home .\nHe started to lead a group of fellows who gave themselves the name \u201c Bisque \u201d ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmmakers that \u201c we \u2019 re young , and I think we \u2019 re more talented.\n\u201d In January 2020 , a woman published a blog post ( since removed ) accusing Lucas Leyva of sexual assault .\nLeyva insists that the encounter was consensual , as does a second woman who participated ; he filed a defamation suit , which is ongoing .\nBefore he resigned as president , Leyva lobbied the Borscht board to replace him with Bazile .\nThey turned Leyva \u2019 s request down .\n( It ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its support , and today Borscht is essentially defunct . )\nBazile \u2019 s professional ambitions had been denied .\nWith Borscht crumbling , he had lost the space and the money to make art .\nThen the coronavirus closed down the city .\nFriends who came from money retreated to the safety of their family homes .\nBazile lashed out on social media against people he thought were trying to take down Borscht .\nHe spent more of his time on Instagram , making a name for himself in the obscure reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed communities of posters who make densely ironic memes about topics like anarcho-capitalism and French philosopher Gilles Deleuze .\nDuring the George Floyd protests , as Instagram filled up with black squares and calls for donations to racial justice causes of varying seriousness , Bazile told friends that he was overcome by cynicism .\nWith his \u201c royal flush \u201d of identities , cancel culture should work for him , he said to a friend .\nBut here he was without prospects , all because of Borscht being canceled .\nMeanwhile , wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t care about him or Black people in general , were making symbolic gestures \u2014 chasing clout \u2014 on social media .\nBazile told friends that he was drawn to Afropessimism , a bleak philosophy of race arguing that anti-Black violence is so fundamental to the nature of Western society that the only way to end it would be to end the world as we know it .\nIn a December 2020 appearance on the cult film podcast The Ion Pack , Bazile said that around this time , he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown.\n\u201d But the trip led to a moment of clarity : The culture that had robbed him had its own rules , which he could use to his advantage .\n\u201c If I act like how people on these apps are acting , who are trying to chase social capital by canceling people , I need to participate in this market , \u201d he said on the podcast .\nCancellation was a form of currency , maybe the only one he had .\n\u201c That \u2019 s when I started shitposting \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI haven \u2019 t stopped since then.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to explain what Bazile did on Instagram starting in mid-2020 .\nFirst of all , he kept getting banned , so only one of his accounts , @ all_triggers _no _warnings , is still accessible .\nSecond , he posted things that are so offensive they are tricky to describe .\nHe posted at such a blistering pace and in such contradictory ways that to fasten it down with adjectives feels beside the point .\nBazile posted pro-Trump memes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in blackface , memes mocking anti-fat discourse , a photograph of a Hegel T-shirt , hundreds of bizarre and abject clips he found on TikTok , a drawing of a Black man performing fellatio on a white penis at the summit of a milk crate challenge .\nHe took so many political stances that he seemed to be mocking the idea of having a political stance at all .\nHe gained access to a massively ironic Instagram collective called the Incellectuals , then got booted for being too offensive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cult figure .\n\u201c Ironic Blackness needs to take up digital space , \u201d he said in the Ion Pack interview .\nLeftists were taking back online irony from \u201c alt-right motherfuckers , \u201d he said , and centrists just couldn \u2019 t deal .\nOne of his gimmicks was to respond to offended white commenters with a link to his Cash App , as if to say , If you want me to read your opinion , you have to pay me .\nThese payments kept Bazile afloat for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at an upscale ice cream parlor .\nHe didn \u2019 t have a car ; he begged for rides ; he crashed on couches .\nWhen Leyva asked him whether he wanted to be the creative director of the NPCC , he said yes .\nSome of Bazile \u2019 s friends were unsettled that he was going to work for a festival that was funded by Thiel \u2019 s money and created by a disgraced man plotting a second act .\nIn long arguments over Instagram DMs that summer , Bazile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to make work that conventional patrons would never support .\n\u201c There was a constant fight between what he wanted to say and what a liberal institution would want him to say or make work about , \u201d Pedro Bello , a friend of his , told me .\nHe also made it clear that his relationships with Belove and Thiel were transactional .\nHe knew he was a convenient face for the festival , but he knew NPCC was an opportunity .\nThat was the exchange : Use and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he wanted to do , \u201d said a friend of Bazile \u2019 s , who asked that I identify him by his Instagram handle , @ gaypanique2 .\n\u201c He saw it as a wager .\nThe wager he was making was , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to deal with these unsavory people.\n\u2019 It was very practical .\nHe was not hiding anything .\n\u2018 I \u2019 m poor , I need money , I need money to do art .\nWhat does it matter if it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving it to me ?\nWe \u2019 re going to celebrate and laugh in the face of destruction.\n\u2019 \u201d Bazile arrived in New York in July 2021 , rented an apartment in Brooklyn , and went about trying to organize a film festival .\nHe had to contend with Hadrian Belove \u2019 s reputation .\nCinefamily \u2019 s implosion had left a crater in the independent film scene in LA , and now Belove had shown up on the East Coast , trailed by rumors that he had financial support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his two young co-organizers down , unwilling or afraid to participate in what had become known unofficially as the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d But Bazile had cachet among a new clique of Instagram-obsessed Manhattan scenesters .\nAt a July party at Russian Samovar thrown by The Ion Pack and cohosted by influencer Caroline Calloway , Leyva watched , amused , as a crowd of people formed around his old fellow , hoping to meet Trevor \u201c Memes \u201d Bazile .\n( A Grub Street party report described the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , very online people.\n\u201d ) It was the exact scene Belove had hoped to leverage .\nBazile and his co-organizers slowly put together a lineup of 23 films .\nIt included screenings of a debut by a high school teacher , an Austrian movie about an android , two older works involving literary men in various stages of post-cancellation cultural limbo , and the debut of a short film by Kids director Larry Clark .\nAlex Lee Moyer screened a cut of her follow-up to TFW NO GF , a strenuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUp until the last minute , the NPCC suffered cancellations \u2014 real ones .\nClark fell out for medical reasons , then The Ion Pack hosts , who were set to interview the filmmaker , withdrew .\nThen noise band Wolf Eyes dropped out .\nThe Ace Hotel was originally supposed to host Bazile \u2019 s big party but backed out after staffers were alarmed by offensive jokes on the NPCC \u2019 s Twitter account , which Bazile ran .\n\u201c The central themes of our festival are around transgression and deplatformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to an Ace spokesperson .\n\u201c In contemporary liberal art spaces , especially those that exist online , whenever an artist engages themes of transgression or subversion they are assumed to be right wing , or white supremacist , regardless of the intent or content of their work.\n\u201d Then , only a week before the festival was set to begin , a Brooklyn synagogue informed the organizers that it would no longer host Red Scare and John Waters because anonymous callers had claimed the festival was antisemitic .\nThe best-known filmmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was Caveh Zahedi , whose documentaries the New York Times called in a 2019 profile \u201c abject , self-defeating , ethically questionable , and maddeningly original.\n\u201d Friends and colleagues at the New School tried to talk him out of doing the festival because of the Thiel money , a request he found hypocritical given the compromised nature of film funding in general .\n\u201c A lot of the grants people get come from horrible abuses that generate tons of profit that make philanthropy possible in the first place , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s most loved films , The Sheik and I , was originally commissioned for the 2011 Sharjah Biennial on the theme of \u201c art as a subversive act.\n\u201d The film Zahedi ended up making so ruthlessly satirized the United Arab Emirates that it was banned , and the director himself was threatened with arrest .\nIn Zahedi \u2019 s world , it doesn \u2019 t make sense for an artist to reject bad money , because the system that gives the money value is itself bad ; rather , the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a statement .\nBut what kind of statement did Bazile want to make ?\nA dedicated observer of the strange and shifting politics of the internet might squint and see in his NPCC something like a coming-out party for the \u201c Post Left , \u201d a strange and shifting term .\nDerided by journalist Carl Beijer as \u201c an internet clique waiting on a check , \u201d the \u201c Post Left \u201d sometimes refers to a group of online media figures who reject the American left as insufficiently radical and align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore importantly , it describes a chaotic internet subculture that is closely associated with the depressive outlook of Gen Z \u2014 the milieu in which Bazile had become a minor star .\nBetter thought of as an attitude than a coherent politics , this \u201c Post Left \u201d associates identity politics with self-righteous millennials and confused boomers .\nSo too does it reject electoral politics , which it sees as fatally compromised by capitalism and preposterously insufficient to the task of addressing the climate crisis .\nGleefully ironic , this sensibility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the sympathetic position that the most appropriate response to the end of the world might be to laugh and play .\nEspecially if Peter Thiel is paying .\nSeveral months after the festival , Nile Harris , Bazile \u2019 s collaborator , posted to Instagram a picture of the pair on the Eldridge Street roof , standing inside a deflated blow-up castle in front of a painted white brick wall .\nIn the photograph , they both stare into the camera .\n\u201c Peter Thiel bought me a house , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a home.\n\u201d \u201c It felt like , look at what we can do with his money , \u201d one attendee said .\n\u201c Look at what we \u2019 re doing with your money , you dick.\n\u201d Generations of artists have defined themselves by rebelling against the values of the bourgeoisie .\nBut a subculture based on transgressing bourgeois norms in 2021 faces a trap : It can look indistinguishable from Trumpism .\nThe distinction between shocking liberals as an aesthetic goal and a political one starts to blur .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world an original cultural sensibility , but it also gave the world Gavin McInnes , the founder of the Proud Boys .\nWhile working on her documentary about Alex Jones , Moyer attended the Jan. 6 \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally ; that day , she posted to Instagram a photograph in the hotel room of pro-Trump indie musician Ariel Pink , who did the soundtrack for TFW NO GF and had attended the rally in support of the former President .\nThe attempt to re-create a scuzzy hipster nihilism \u2014 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most notorious financier \u2014 feels to some like the farce arriving before the tragedy has even ended .\nThat \u2019 s why Ed Halter , the old New York Underground Film Festival organizer , never responded to Hadrian Belove \u2019 s email .\n\u201c I have a Gen X embarrassment about this myself , \u201d said Halter , who is now a critic in residence at Bard College .\n\u201c I understand why they reached out to me .\nFor that very reason I did not want to be any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2019 90s was anti-political , whereas now it \u2019 s being harnessed to a cynical right-wing politics .\nAnd I feel old enough now to see the trick.\n\u201d What makes the new transgressive culture more complicated is it sees the trick as well \u2014 and folds it into the joke .\nIndeed , \u201c Thiel as fascist paymaster \u201d is now such a media trope that it has become a kind of meme in the Post Left , with associated microcelebrities joking about `` needing Thiel money '' or being Venmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d as Post Left internet communities sometimes call them , are , in this sense , less important as a source of income than as a shock tactic ; claiming them , ironically or otherwise , confers its own bizarro credibility .\nIn the days leading up to the NPCC festival , Bazile had confided in Gaypanique that he feared there was no organic reason for it to exist beyond Thiel \u2019 s money and Belove \u2019 s ego .\nSo when Gaypanique saw Bazile on the last day of the festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off something on his own terms .\nBut Bazile scoffed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I have the capacity to do this anymore , \u201d he said , cryptically , about the festival .\n\u201c I need you to rip it to shreds.\n\u201d That night , a Philadelphia bartender named Victor Kane , who owns a popular meme account on Instagram called @ chethanxfinsta , arrived in Brooklyn to find Bazile distraught .\nEarly the next morning , Kane posted an Instagram story .\nOn top of a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the night at Bazile \u2019 s apartment : \u201c When I got there he looked like he had way too much to drink [ ... ] We went out and grabbed a couple drinks and returned to the Airbnb to chill and fall asleepv .\nI told him that I was worried bc he was covered in sweat and was wheezing [ ... ] he told me he was just tired and fat and the wheezing was normal .\nStill I crashed on the floor next to him to make sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 mins and when I woke up he was no longer breathing .\nI immediately called 911 and they spent over an hour trying to bring him back however they were not successful .\nIt is with the heaviest heart I have to inform everyone that Trevor passed away at 307am last night and is no longer with us.\n\u201d Then he posted a picture of Bazile , underneath a rippling digital banner .\nIt read , \u201c Rest in Power.\n\u201d When Bazile \u2019 s friends first saw the posts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke .\nEven in the irony-saturated world he inhabited , who would announce a death that way ?\nBut it was true .\nBazile was dead .\nHe was only 25 .\nAccording to Trenny Hardy , Bazile \u2019 s mother , the New York City death certificate lists the cause as \u201c pending further study.\n\u201d On Oct. 29 , the NPCC Instagram made an announcement .\n\u201c He cared deeply about art , and the need for a kind of creative freedom and openness that could be wildly transgressive , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of NPC fest , he said it was because that \u2019 s what culture was turning everyone into\u2014people without independent thought\u2014and that by naming the fest NPC , we could reclaim this concept and cast a sort of spell to free everyone from it.\n\u201d \u201c NPC \u201d is an initialism from computer role-playing games , short for \u201c nonplayer character.\n\u201d It refers to a digital avatar that is controlled by the computer rather than by the player , a digital life running on a little loop .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of American culture in the 2020s : repetitive , preprogrammed , dull .\nBut blaming liberal politics for that repetition ignores deeper cultural tracks laid down over the past two decades by a handful of companies in Silicon Valley , owned and operated by a tiny group of billionaires .\nAny protest of that system from within can be copied , commodified , and turned into its own kind of script .\nSince Trevor Bazile \u2019 s death , there \u2019 s been sniping on Twitter about higher-profile , white posters stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking credit .\nAnd so much of his work has been scrubbed from the internet by Instagram that it \u2019 s hard to say what , exactly , Bazile left behind .\nFor an artist obsessed with taking up new kinds of space , he has in some ways already disappeared .\nHad Bazile lived , friends think he might have redefined indie film in New York or turned into a Virgil Abloh figure .\nIn five years , they say , we \u2019 ll catch up to what he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen , \u201d said Pedro Bello , the friend from Miami .\n\u201c He was still trapped pleasing people to reach his goals .\nHis sentence is not complete.\n\u201d In the end , the attempt to re-create in miniature the druggy , anything-goes downtown Manhattan of the 1990s ended with a brilliant young person dying .\nYou could call it ironic , if you wanted to .\nA deeper irony is that beneath the NPCC \u2019 s rhetoric of transgression lay a perfectly neat series of exchanges : money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity for clout , and so on .\nIndeed , Peter Thiel \u2019 s real influence over the \u201c postwoke , \u201d or the \u201c Post Left , \u201d or whatever this sensibility comes to be called , might be thought of in a different way .\nThe subculture has the same logic as the tech oligarchy that Thiel embodies .\nIt follows the same rules \u2014 imitate , iterate , transact .\nAt the screening of the Alex Jones documentary , the audience had to sign nondisclosure agreements : legal documents ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival .\nIt was all very Silicon Valley .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The jury in the first Jan. 6 trial spent Thursday hearing from government witnesses that defendant Guy Reffitt wasn \u2019 t just recorded on camera at the US Capitol \u2014 he described his plans , actions , and motivations in detail in dozens of texts , a video he recorded from his own helmet-mounted camera , and an audio recording that his son secretly made once he returned home .\nReffitt is facing a five-count indictment for participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection , including charges that he carried a pistol on his hip as he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the Capitol and that he threatened his children later not to turn him in to federal investigators .\nThe day before , the government \u2019 s presentation to the jury had focused on the visual evidence of Reffitt \u2019 s presence at the Capitol .\nOn Thursday , it was all about his own words .\nThe day ended with testimony from Reffitt 's son , Jackson Reffitt , who bolstered the government 's case with firsthand testimony about his father 's messages and mindset around the time of the insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familial fallout of his decision to cooperate with federal authorities .\nReffitt cried when Jackson took the stand , according to a pool reporter in the room .\nThe 19-year-old Jackson said he did n't regret his decision to share information with the FBI , but also spoke about the guilt and sadness he felt .\nThroughout the morning , the jury saw dozens of messages \u2014 some regular texts , some sent via the Telegram app \u2014 that the FBI pulled from an iPhone seized during a search of Reffitt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of his family and some were sent to other individuals , including people identified by the government as members of the Texas Three Percenters militant group , of which he was a member .\nIn these messages , the user identified as Reffitt described his objectives as he planned to travel to DC and his intention to travel with weapons , his narration of events as they unfolded that day , his attempts at identifying himself after the fact in videos recorded on the scene , and his thoughts about what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a leader in the initial breach of the building , even though he didn \u2019 t go inside , describing him as the \u201c tip of the mob \u2019 s spear.\n\u201d In a text thread with his wife and children , Reffitt wrote on Dec. 24 , \u201c What \u2019 s about to happen will shock the world \u201d and that removing members of the legislature was , he said , \u201c why I \u2019 m going to DC.\n\u201d On the morning of Jan. 6 , one of his kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was risking \u201c not only your business but ur life too.\n\u201d Reffitt replied , \u201c I have no intentions on throwing it away .\nI love ALL of you with ALL of my heart and soul .\nThis is for our country for ALL OF YOU and your kids .\nGod Bless us one and all.\n\u201d After the riot , Reffitt told the family chat , \u201c We took the United States Capital , \u201d and sent messages identifying himself in media coverage .\nIn one message , he noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he was on the handrail of the stairs going up to the Capitol .\nAfterward , he sent a message to another person that read , \u201c And this was me forcing the Capital Police hand , \u201d with an attached image that showed the scene at the Capitol where he was standing on the railing with police at the top of the stairs .\nThe jury saw multiple conversations involving Reffitt via Telegram , where his username was \u201c Call to Arms , \u201d which in one message he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d with the Texas Three Percenters .\nHe appeared to predict violence .\nWhen one person messaged in December , \u201c The only way you will be able to do anything in DC is if you get the crowd to drag the traitors out , \u201d Reffitt responded , \u201c I don \u2019 t think anyone going to DC has any other agenda.\n\u201d On the morning of Jan. 6 , he messaged a Telegram group , \u201c As we oil our weapons .\nHold our beer and watch this shit.\n\u201d Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We took the Capital of the United States of America .\nWhat have you done today ?\n\u201d He also described himself as \u201c the lead up the Capital stairs.\n\u201d \u201c Multiple clay bullets and a battle cry like in Braveheart .\nThe insurrection began immediately after , \u201d Reffitt wrote .\nSome of the messages before and after Jan. 6 featured references to being armed .\nIn December , he discussed \u201c going in hot.\n\u201d On Jan. 6 , when someone asked for an update , Reffitt wrote that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back for weapons hot.\n\u201d In some messages , he repeated his celebration of his participation in the attack on the Capitol .\nLate that day , he messaged someone , \u201c I was the first person to light the fire on the Capital steps .\nWE TOOK THE CAPITAL\u2026 !\n!\n!\n\u201d In a Jan. 9 message , he wrote , \u201c We took the Capital of the United States of America and we will do it again.\n\u201d Some of his messages tracked testimony that the jury heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former US Capitol Police officer who spoke about deploying an estimated 40 to 50 pepper balls at Reffitt as he advanced up the stairwell on the railing at the head of the crowd .\nHe described being hit in the chest and then the legs , how those projectiles didn \u2019 t stop him from moving up \u2014 \u201c I laughed and moved up \u201d \u2014 and how an officer \u2019 s use of pepper spray finally stopped him .\nHe said he had to go back to clean his eyes but noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past police , so , he wrote , \u201c My job was done then.\n\u201d The messages showed that Reffitt didn \u2019 t receive a unanimously positive reaction after he returned to Texas .\nIn a Jan. 11 group chat on Telegram , Reffitt wrote , \u201c Yes we did encroach the US Capital .\nWhat were the rest of you doing that day ?\n\u201d One person replied , \u201c Well Yahoo for you you fucking jackasses because all you accomplished was getting us all declared domestic terrorists \u201d ; another person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d if Reffitt had represented that he was at the Capitol on behalf of the Texas Three Percenters .\nReffitt said he \u2019 d removed the insignia and that he wasn \u2019 t identifiable as a member ; he noted that his jacket had Arabic on it because he \u2019 d gotten it in Kuwait , and he was wearing a T-shirt for the Oath Keepers , a right-wing extremist group .\nLater in the morning , the jury saw a photo dated Jan. 5 , 2021 , that the FBI pulled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show him wearing a black T-shirt with \u201c Oath Keepers Texas \u201d written in yellow text .\nThe jury also saw two videos that the FBI pulled from an external hard drive found in his home .\nBoth appeared to be recorded by a portable 360-degree camera that Reffitt had worn attached to a helmet on Jan. 6 .\nThe video appeared to start at around 11:20 a.m. on Jan. 6 and showed a large crowd gathered at the Ellipse .\nA voice that the government said was Reffitt is heard talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone asks his name and he says , \u201c Guy.\n\u201d \u2022 None \u201c We \u2019 re taking the Capitol before the day is over .\n\u2026 Ripping them out by their hair .\nEvery fucking one of them.\n\u201d \u2022 None \u201c I just want to see Pelosi \u2019 s head hit every fucking stair on the way out \u2026 and Mitch McConnell too.\n\u201d \u2022 None \u201c I \u2019 m packing heat and I \u2019 m going to get more heat.\n\u201d \u2022 None \u201c Whatever it takes to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty it out.\n\u201d When another man asked what would happen if police opened fire , Reffitt replied that there would be a \u201c hell rain of fire \u201d and assured the man that the people he came with \u201c came in hot , so did I.\n\u201d The jury next saw part of a recording of a Zoom conference that Reffitt participated in with other members of the Texas Three Percenters .\nWearing glasses and a camouflage print hat that read \u201c Trump , \u201d he made more references to wanting violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described his confrontation with Kerkhoff on the Capitol stairway and said that he wasn \u2019 t trying to be \u201c arrogant \u201d but that the crowd wasn \u2019 t moving forward until he took action .\nAfter he was pepper-sprayed , he described waving on the mob and yelling , \u201c Go forward !\nGo forward !\n\u201d Reffitt made a reference to being armed , telling the group that he had a \u201c .40 on [ his ] side.\n\u201d He also said that other members of the crowd around him were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow member of the Texas Three Percenters he was traveling with and who is set to testify as a government witness with immunity .\n\u201c They \u2019 re lucky we didn \u2019 t shoot \u2018 em , \u201d Reffitt said .\n\u201c I mean they really need to be grateful.\n\u201d Reffitt \u2019 s lawyer William Welch III briefly questioned the FBI special agent about the videos pulled from the hard drive , asking her if there \u2019 d be any indication in the file name if someone had altered the content .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ show any sign of that .\nWelch then brought up the concept of \u201c deepfakes , \u201d suggesting that a defense strategy might be to try to convince the jury that evidence was tampered with ; the FBI agent said she saw no evidence of changes .\nIn the afternoon , the jury heard from Jackson Reffitt , who was 18 on Jan. 6 , 2021 .\nWith his father sitting across the courtroom , Jackson described how their relationship changed around 2016 , and that he moved politically to the left as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson talked about his father \u2019 s membership in the Texas Three Percenters \u2014 he said Reffitt flew a flag with the Three Percenters logo outside their house \u2014 and his ownership of guns , including a handgun , which he carried on his waist and kept on the nightstand when he slept , and a rifle .\nThe prosecutor had Jackson narrate a series of text messages that he and his father had exchanged in the family \u2019 s group chat before , during , and after Jan. 6 .\nJackson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might do as Reffitt in late December shared his plan to go to Washington and used phrases like \u201c We are about to rise up.\n\u201d Jackson said he became so concerned that he decided to alert the FBI .\nJackson said he was in his room and googled how to submit a tip and did so through a website .\nHe said that he felt \u201c nervous , \u201d \u201c gross , \u201d and \u201c uncomfortable , \u201d and tried to distract himself so he wouldn \u2019 t \u201c linger \u201d over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel more guilt than [ he ] already did.\n\u201d He said he tried to avoid talking politics afterward when the family spent Christmas together .\nOn Jan. 6 , Jackson said he was at his girlfriend \u2019 s house when he saw texts that led him to believe his father had gone to Washington .\nHe said he went home , where his mother confirmed it .\nJackson narrated a series of texts that he exchanged with his father on Jan. 8 , in which Reffitt told them how to see video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned his father that people were being arrested .\nJackson said he was at home in the living room when Reffitt arrived back the night of Jan. 8 .\nReffitt 's luggage included a case with a rifle in it \u2014 Jackson said his dad took it out \u2014 and he had a handgun on his waist .\nAs the family talked about what had happened , Jackson said he decided to record the conversation , explaining that he was concerned about not being believed later and that it was better to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard clips from that audio recording .\nAt first , as Reffitt talks about how he \u201c started the fire , \u201d his wife , Nicole Reffitt , is heard urging him not to talk about it , and he replies that he should be able to speak in the \u201c security \u201d of his own home .\nThere \u2019 s laughter when Reffitt refers to the attack as \u201c the insurrection.\n\u201d The family teases Reffitt when it becomes apparent that his camera only recorded one second at the Capitol .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point , \u201c I felt so patriotic and felt like such an American.\n\u201d Jackson testified that Reffitt took the handgun out of its holster when he talked to the family about having a loaded gun with him at the Capitol and how he and others chose not to open fire .\nLater , Jackson is heard pushing back when his father insists he didn \u2019 t break the law .\n\u201c You just said that you brought a weapon on there , \u201d Jackson said .\nReffitt replies , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we own , \u201d and refers to the Second Amendment .\nThe son described a conversation with his father and his younger sister on Jan. 11 , when Reffitt allegedly told them that if they turned him in they were traitors and \u201c traitors get shot.\n\u201d A little later , Jackson said that his sister , who was 16 at the time , was on her phone and that his father \u201c snapped \u201d at her , saying that if she was recording him he \u2019 d put a bullet through @ @ @

later if needed .\nHe was still living at home , and talked about wanting to be there to \u201c comfort \u201d his family , but moved out after they learned that he \u2019 d talked to the FBI , saying they had reacted \u201c pretty hard.\n\u201d He said he hadn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family since then and that he was sad about that but also that he didn \u2019 t regret his choice .\nThe prosecutor noted that he \u2019 d spoken with the media and received more than $ 158,000 through a GoFundMe campaign and asked if he \u2019 d come forward to get famous or make money .\nHe said no , saying he felt

questioned the sincerity of his testimony about wanting to comfort his family , asking why he didn \u2019 t give them a heads-up about speaking to the press ; Jackson said he wanted to avoid a bigger

        "content": "The party on Eldridge Street could hardly be contained : Bodies spilled out of the front door onto the sidewalk , and joyous screams echoed from the roof .\nInside , under the wood beams of the $ 7.5 million carriage house , a DJ played techno for a young and queer crowd .\nAmid throngs of twentysomethings who were pierced and shorn in unusual places , a performance artist named Crackhead Barney roamed around in a Trump mask , breasts bared , past a man painted green from head to toe , wearing only a jockstrap and an alligator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOver the sound of a jazz band , the screams were now clearer : \u201c This is being paid for by Peter Thiel !\n\u201d At the center of the pandemonium was a young artist from Miami named Trevor Bazile .\nDressed inconspicuously in a baggy hoodie and jeans , he raced from conversation to conversation , stopping along the way to pluck at a stand-up bass and then to bounce around an art installation set inside a children \u2019 s blow-up castle .\nA chaotic mix of short films , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dance parties , NPCC brought together respected independent filmmakers , hard-right software developers , leftist DJs , and queer performance artists .\nIt built buzz through a new downtown media scene that revolves around a handful of interlocking podcasts with provocative politics .\n( The hosts of Red Scare , the most popular of those shows , interviewed legendary cult filmmaker John Waters on NPCC \u2019 s first night . )\nThe fest \u2019 s aesthetic was one of deliberate bad taste \u2014 official T-shirts depicted the Statue of Liberty dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Worst Is Yet to Come.\n\u201d But in 2022 , bad taste carries a political charge .\nThe NPCC acquired a derisive nickname during its planning : the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d In part , that \u2019 s because rumors of right-wing funding swirled around the festival in the months leading up to it .\nBut the label reflects something trickier to define , a broader sense that there is a core of young artists and trendsetters in New York and Los Angeles who , post-Trump , are rediscovering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you must , a vibe shift : a new generation of internet-native tastemakers \u2014 like many of the people crowded into Bazile \u2019 s party \u2014 who find the moralistic gatekeeping of millennials all a bit pass\u00e9 .\nA youthful subculture that rejects liberal pieties naturally excites the American right .\nIt \u2019 s a sign of the pendulum swinging , a chance to break the culture war stalemate of the Trump years .\nThiel , who did not comment for this story , has called identity politics an \u201c insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weakens the United States .\nAn investment in a culture of cool that declares \u201c wokeness \u201d unfashionable , like an investment in politicians who attack the teaching of critical race theory in schools or an investment that steers kids away from college , is a way of disconnecting the next generation from the power grid of contemporary liberalism .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of disruption .\nBut the allure of such a shift stretches beyond MAGA Republicans .\nThere \u2019 s a diverse coalition of Americans who resent the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled liberals who think aspects of # MeToo and the racial justice movement are excessive or cynically self-promotional , media figures who have built lucrative careers banging on about \u201c cancel culture , \u201d and artists and writers of previous generations who find the current cultural constraints intolerable .\n`` Transgressive organizations like the \u2018 New People \u2019 s Cinema Club \u2019 must survive because they help keep devious ideas near and dear to the hearts of the young , '' Waters wrote in an email .\nSelf-aware and supremely ironic creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwoke \u201d set understand that they are useful to the right and even joke about it .\nBazile knew he had been cast for a part in someone else \u2019 s vision of the future .\nBut he accepted the role because he saw in it the chance to pursue his own radical creative agenda \u2014 a dynamic nearly as old as art patronage itself .\nAfter the NPCC , a meme went around that depicted a large puppet , labeled \u201c Trevor Bazile , \u201d holding a smaller puppet , labeled \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding an even smaller puppet , which was labeled \u201c Peter Thiel.\n\u201d The image has a knowingly absurd implication : that an unknown young filmmaker , of all people , could manipulate an oligarch who is known as a right-wing puppet master .\nBut it also contains a more complex truth .\nFor Bazile , who above all was aware of the way he was being used , Peter Thiel \u2019 s money was an opportunity to build a new space in the rubble of American culture .\nIn 2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repertory movie theater in Los Angeles .\nPlaying a mix of strange , forgotten , and contemporary films , the theater quickly turned into \u201c an epicenter of young Hollywood , \u201d according to Variety .\nThen , in August 2017 , a widely distributed anonymous email accused Belove of \u201c sexual harassment , assault , and abuse by former employees and volunteers.\n\u201d Though he denied the allegations , calling them \u201c demonstrable lies and half-truths , \u201d Belove resigned from Cinefamily days after the email was sent .\nOne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belove was a young film editor named Alex Lee Moyer , who had an idea for a documentary .\nThe film would be about a group of driftless young men who gather on 4chan and Twitter to vent their frustration with their lack of romantic and professional prospects .\nBelove was drawn to the subject matter .\nHe felt that these young men had been swept up in an online moral panic ( this one over \u201c incels \u201d ) and that a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary about their lives would make clear how overblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Moyer with the film , TFW NO GF ( imageboard shorthand for \u201c that feeling when no girlfriend.\n\u201d ) Right-wing politics hovered at the edges of the production ; 3D-printed guns advocate Cody Wilson was an early financial supporter .\nBut the documentary itself is affectless , refraining from any judgment of its subjects .\nIn March 2020 , as Belove and Moyer were preparing to screen the film at the South by Southwest festival , they attended a live taping in Los Angeles of Other Life , a podcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe guest was Curtis Yarvin , a prolific blogger and software developer who first achieved notice under the pseudonym \u201c Mencius Moldbug.\n\u201d Writing as Moldbug from 2007 to 2014 , Yarvin became synonymous with \u201c neoreaction , \u201d an abstruse political philosophy that prefers rational authoritarianism to democracy .\nTo the extent that Yarvin is held to be dangerous rather than offensive or kooky , it is because of the sense that he represents an unexpressed current of antidemocratic belief in Silicon Valley .\nBut when Belove listened to Yarvin speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent bong-hit philosopher .\nCurtis Yarvin \u2019 s relationship with Peter Thiel is both well documented and incompletely understood .\nOn the one hand , Yarvin is close enough with Thiel to have watched the 2016 election at the venture capitalist \u2019 s home and to have taken the billionaire \u2019 s investment capital for his startup , Tlon .\n( He also has emailed about politics with Thiel since at least 2013 . )\nOn the other hand , Thiel has invested in a variety of quixotic ventures , including 3D-printed meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be a mug \u2019 s game to try to disentangle Thiel \u2019 s economic interests from his political commitments from his flights of intellectual fancy from the pet projects of his friends .\nStill , to the degree Thiel embodies Silicon Valley \u2019 s contrarianism , cultural insecurity , and nose for a new market , a \u201c postwoke \u201d film company seemed like a natural fit .\nThiel \u2019 s investments in politics have been high profile and consequential , but his ventures in culture and media \u2014 beyond funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been scattershot .\nIn 2018 , BuzzFeed News revealed that Thiel had considered creating a conservative news network ; nothing came of it .\nHe funded the conservative political journal American Affairs , a contrarian science quarterly , and , according to a recent biography , the \u201c heterodox \u201d website Quillette .\nThe Thiel Foundation subsidiary Imitatio , dedicated to the thought of the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard , once purchased a table at a benefit put on by n+1 , a leftist literary magazine .\nIt \u2019 s unclear exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play Nice Ltd. , which Belove registered in California in September 2020 .\n( According to Belove , there are multiple investors , including others from the tech industry . )\nBut at times , Thiel \u2019 s employees have been closely involved in Belove \u2019 s activities .\nIn July 2021 , Belove screened films and partied at the Cannes Film Festival with Jimmy Kaltreider , the executive director of the Thiel Foundation .\nIn texts , Belove referred to members of Thiel Capital as his \u201c traveling companions \u201d and mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaltreider .\nBy this point , Belove had cycled through several ideas for Play Nice .\nIt could be a seed fund , or a production company , or maybe even a streaming service .\nStill , he was at heart a film programmer , and he loved the idea of a festival .\nIn LA , Belove \u2019 s name was toxic .\nBut he knew New York had a thriving young cultural scene , one nostalgic for an authentic city it never knew but half-remembered through the risk-taking films of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially inspired by the notorious , defunct New York Underground Film Festival , Belove reached out in April 2021 to Ed Halter , its former director .\n\u201c I got funding to support a new york underground film fest bringing together the new dirtbag film scene , \u201d Belove wrote in an email .\n\u201c I want to help expand it .\nWe want to be all over town , pop-ups , secret screenings , no website , text invites like rave [ ... ] real underground.\n\u201d Belove didn \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he knew his name would be a distraction .\nSo who could help him find and mentor the young artists he wanted to attract ?\nBelove had been collaborating on Play Nice with Lucas Leyva , the founder of a well-regarded Miami film collective called the Borscht Corporation .\nAnd Leyva said that he knew an extraordinary person who was just right for the job of creative director .\nTrevor Bazile knew what the culture saw when it looked at him : a \u201c royal flush of identities , \u201d as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Black , he was queer , he didn \u2019 t have money , and he was the child of a Haitian immigrant .\nHe was also , according to nearly everyone who encountered him , some kind of genius .\nIn 2017 , Bazile turned up at Borscht to volunteer and never really left .\nStarted in 2005 by Leyva , Borscht had a well-earned reputation for developing the talents of untrained , often first-generation American filmmakers .\nOscar-winning director Barry Jenkins made a short film for Borscht , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d without the collective .\nAs Borscht built its name , it drew investment from major institutional supporters of the arts , including the Knight Foundation , Time Warner , and the Andy Warhol Foundation .\nBy the time Bazile arrived , Borscht was already an established draw for eccentric young artists .\nInspired by the idea of an authentic culture in a city known for its superficial glitz , Borscht fellows were a mix of posh kids with prestigious arts training and local kids from working-class families .\n( The program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s grandson . )\nIt was an exciting , combustible combination .\nBazile stood out immediately .\n\u201c His brain was glow-in-the-dark , special , \u201d Leyva said .\n\u201c He thought differently from anyone else.\n\u201d Bazile made formally inventive , jazz-inflected short films , but also sculptures and installations .\nHe would sleep in the Borscht space , located in an old mall in downtown Miami , and it became a second home .\nHe started to lead a group of fellows who gave themselves the name \u201c Bisque \u201d ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmmakers that \u201c we \u2019 re young , and I think we \u2019 re more talented.\n\u201d In January 2020 , a woman published a blog post ( since removed ) accusing Lucas Leyva of sexual assault .\nLeyva insists that the encounter was consensual , as does a second woman who participated ; he filed a defamation suit , which is ongoing .\nBefore he resigned as president , Leyva lobbied the Borscht board to replace him with Bazile .\nThey turned Leyva \u2019 s request down .\n( It ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its support , and today Borscht is essentially defunct . )\nBazile \u2019 s professional ambitions had been denied .\nWith Borscht crumbling , he had lost the space and the money to make art .\nThen the coronavirus closed down the city .\nFriends who came from money retreated to the safety of their family homes .\nBazile lashed out on social media against people he thought were trying to take down Borscht .\nHe spent more of his time on Instagram , making a name for himself in the obscure reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed communities of posters who make densely ironic memes about topics like anarcho-capitalism and French philosopher Gilles Deleuze .\nDuring the George Floyd protests , as Instagram filled up with black squares and calls for donations to racial justice causes of varying seriousness , Bazile told friends that he was overcome by cynicism .\nWith his \u201c royal flush \u201d of identities , cancel culture should work for him , he said to a friend .\nBut here he was without prospects , all because of Borscht being canceled .\nMeanwhile , wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t care about him or Black people in general , were making symbolic gestures \u2014 chasing clout \u2014 on social media .\nBazile told friends that he was drawn to Afropessimism , a bleak philosophy of race arguing that anti-Black violence is so fundamental to the nature of Western society that the only way to end it would be to end the world as we know it .\nIn a December 2020 appearance on the cult film podcast The Ion Pack , Bazile said that around this time , he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown.\n\u201d But the trip led to a moment of clarity : The culture that had robbed him had its own rules , which he could use to his advantage .\n\u201c If I act like how people on these apps are acting , who are trying to chase social capital by canceling people , I need to participate in this market , \u201d he said on the podcast .\nCancellation was a form of currency , maybe the only one he had .\n\u201c That \u2019 s when I started shitposting \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI haven \u2019 t stopped since then.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to explain what Bazile did on Instagram starting in mid-2020 .\nFirst of all , he kept getting banned , so only one of his accounts , @ all_triggers _no _warnings , is still accessible .\nSecond , he posted things that are so offensive they are tricky to describe .\nHe posted at such a blistering pace and in such contradictory ways that to fasten it down with adjectives feels beside the point .\nBazile posted pro-Trump memes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in blackface , memes mocking anti-fat discourse , a photograph of a Hegel T-shirt , hundreds of bizarre and abject clips he found on TikTok , a drawing of a Black man performing fellatio on a white penis at the summit of a milk crate challenge .\nHe took so many political stances that he seemed to be mocking the idea of having a political stance at all .\nHe gained access to a massively ironic Instagram collective called the Incellectuals , then got booted for being too offensive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cult figure .\n\u201c Ironic Blackness needs to take up digital space , \u201d he said in the Ion Pack interview .\nLeftists were taking back online irony from \u201c alt-right motherfuckers , \u201d he said , and centrists just couldn \u2019 t deal .\nOne of his gimmicks was to respond to offended white commenters with a link to his Cash App , as if to say , If you want me to read your opinion , you have to pay me .\nThese payments kept Bazile afloat for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at an upscale ice cream parlor .\nHe didn \u2019 t have a car ; he begged for rides ; he crashed on couches .\nWhen Leyva asked him whether he wanted to be the creative director of the NPCC , he said yes .\nSome of Bazile \u2019 s friends were unsettled that he was going to work for a festival that was funded by Thiel \u2019 s money and created by a disgraced man plotting a second act .\nIn long arguments over Instagram DMs that summer , Bazile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to make work that conventional patrons would never support .\n\u201c There was a constant fight between what he wanted to say and what a liberal institution would want him to say or make work about , \u201d Pedro Bello , a friend of his , told me .\nHe also made it clear that his relationships with Belove and Thiel were transactional .\nHe knew he was a convenient face for the festival , but he knew NPCC was an opportunity .\nThat was the exchange : Use and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he wanted to do , \u201d said a friend of Bazile \u2019 s , who asked that I identify him by his Instagram handle , @ gaypanique2 .\n\u201c He saw it as a wager .\nThe wager he was making was , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to deal with these unsavory people.\n\u2019 It was very practical .\nHe was not hiding anything .\n\u2018 I \u2019 m poor , I need money , I need money to do art .\nWhat does it matter if it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving it to me ?\nWe \u2019 re going to celebrate and laugh in the face of destruction.\n\u2019 \u201d Bazile arrived in New York in July 2021 , rented an apartment in Brooklyn , and went about trying to organize a film festival .\nHe had to contend with Hadrian Belove \u2019 s reputation .\nCinefamily \u2019 s implosion had left a crater in the independent film scene in LA , and now Belove had shown up on the East Coast , trailed by rumors that he had financial support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his two young co-organizers down , unwilling or afraid to participate in what had become known unofficially as the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d But Bazile had cachet among a new clique of Instagram-obsessed Manhattan scenesters .\nAt a July party at Russian Samovar thrown by The Ion Pack and cohosted by influencer Caroline Calloway , Leyva watched , amused , as a crowd of people formed around his old fellow , hoping to meet Trevor \u201c Memes \u201d Bazile .\n( A Grub Street party report described the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , very online people.\n\u201d ) It was the exact scene Belove had hoped to leverage .\nBazile and his co-organizers slowly put together a lineup of 23 films .\nIt included screenings of a debut by a high school teacher , an Austrian movie about an android , two older works involving literary men in various stages of post-cancellation cultural limbo , and the debut of a short film by Kids director Larry Clark .\nAlex Lee Moyer screened a cut of her follow-up to TFW NO GF , a strenuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUp until the last minute , the NPCC suffered cancellations \u2014 real ones .\nClark fell out for medical reasons , then The Ion Pack hosts , who were set to interview the filmmaker , withdrew .\nThen noise band Wolf Eyes dropped out .\nThe Ace Hotel was originally supposed to host Bazile \u2019 s big party but backed out after staffers were alarmed by offensive jokes on the NPCC \u2019 s Twitter account , which Bazile ran .\n\u201c The central themes of our festival are around transgression and deplatformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to an Ace spokesperson .\n\u201c In contemporary liberal art spaces , especially those that exist online , whenever an artist engages themes of transgression or subversion they are assumed to be right wing , or white supremacist , regardless of the intent or content of their work.\n\u201d Then , only a week before the festival was set to begin , a Brooklyn synagogue informed the organizers that it would no longer host Red Scare and John Waters because anonymous callers had claimed the festival was antisemitic .\nThe best-known filmmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was Caveh Zahedi , whose documentaries the New York Times called in a 2019 profile \u201c abject , self-defeating , ethically questionable , and maddeningly original.\n\u201d Friends and colleagues at the New School tried to talk him out of doing the festival because of the Thiel money , a request he found hypocritical given the compromised nature of film funding in general .\n\u201c A lot of the grants people get come from horrible abuses that generate tons of profit that make philanthropy possible in the first place , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s most loved films , The Sheik and I , was originally commissioned for the 2011 Sharjah Biennial on the theme of \u201c art as a subversive act.\n\u201d The film Zahedi ended up making so ruthlessly satirized the United Arab Emirates that it was banned , and the director himself was threatened with arrest .\nIn Zahedi \u2019 s world , it doesn \u2019 t make sense for an artist to reject bad money , because the system that gives the money value is itself bad ; rather , the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a statement .\nBut what kind of statement did Bazile want to make ?\nA dedicated observer of the strange and shifting politics of the internet might squint and see in his NPCC something like a coming-out party for the \u201c Post Left , \u201d a strange and shifting term .\nDerided by journalist Carl Beijer as \u201c an internet clique waiting on a check , \u201d the \u201c Post Left \u201d sometimes refers to a group of online media figures who reject the American left as insufficiently radical and align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore importantly , it describes a chaotic internet subculture that is closely associated with the depressive outlook of Gen Z \u2014 the milieu in which Bazile had become a minor star .\nBetter thought of as an attitude than a coherent politics , this \u201c Post Left \u201d associates identity politics with self-righteous millennials and confused boomers .\nSo too does it reject electoral politics , which it sees as fatally compromised by capitalism and preposterously insufficient to the task of addressing the climate crisis .\nGleefully ironic , this sensibility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the sympathetic position that the most appropriate response to the end of the world might be to laugh and play .\nEspecially if Peter Thiel is paying .\nSeveral months after the festival , Nile Harris , Bazile \u2019 s collaborator , posted to Instagram a picture of the pair on the Eldridge Street roof , standing inside a deflated blow-up castle in front of a painted white brick wall .\nIn the photograph , they both stare into the camera .\n\u201c Peter Thiel bought me a house , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a home.\n\u201d \u201c It felt like , look at what we can do with his money , \u201d one attendee said .\n\u201c Look at what we \u2019 re doing with your money , you dick.\n\u201d Generations of artists have defined themselves by rebelling against the values of the bourgeoisie .\nBut a subculture based on transgressing bourgeois norms in 2021 faces a trap : It can look indistinguishable from Trumpism .\nThe distinction between shocking liberals as an aesthetic goal and a political one starts to blur .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world an original cultural sensibility , but it also gave the world Gavin McInnes , the founder of the Proud Boys .\nWhile working on her documentary about Alex Jones , Moyer attended the Jan. 6 \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally ; that day , she posted to Instagram a photograph in the hotel room of pro-Trump indie musician Ariel Pink , who did the soundtrack for TFW NO GF and had attended the rally in support of the former President .\nThe attempt to re-create a scuzzy hipster nihilism \u2014 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most notorious financier \u2014 feels to some like the farce arriving before the tragedy has even ended .\nThat \u2019 s why Ed Halter , the old New York Underground Film Festival organizer , never responded to Hadrian Belove \u2019 s email .\n\u201c I have a Gen X embarrassment about this myself , \u201d said Halter , who is now a critic in residence at Bard College .\n\u201c I understand why they reached out to me .\nFor that very reason I did not want to be any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2019 90s was anti-political , whereas now it \u2019 s being harnessed to a cynical right-wing politics .\nAnd I feel old enough now to see the trick.\n\u201d What makes the new transgressive culture more complicated is it sees the trick as well \u2014 and folds it into the joke .\nIndeed , \u201c Thiel as fascist paymaster \u201d is now such a media trope that it has become a kind of meme in the Post Left , with associated microcelebrities joking about `` needing Thiel money '' or being Venmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d as Post Left internet communities sometimes call them , are , in this sense , less important as a source of income than as a shock tactic ; claiming them , ironically or otherwise , confers its own bizarro credibility .\nIn the days leading up to the NPCC festival , Bazile had confided in Gaypanique that he feared there was no organic reason for it to exist beyond Thiel \u2019 s money and Belove \u2019 s ego .\nSo when Gaypanique saw Bazile on the last day of the festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off something on his own terms .\nBut Bazile scoffed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I have the capacity to do this anymore , \u201d he said , cryptically , about the festival .\n\u201c I need you to rip it to shreds.\n\u201d That night , a Philadelphia bartender named Victor Kane , who owns a popular meme account on Instagram called @ chethanxfinsta , arrived in Brooklyn to find Bazile distraught .\nEarly the next morning , Kane posted an Instagram story .\nOn top of a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the night at Bazile \u2019 s apartment : \u201c When I got there he looked like he had way too much to drink [ ... ] We went out and grabbed a couple drinks and returned to the Airbnb to chill and fall asleepv .\nI told him that I was worried bc he was covered in sweat and was wheezing [ ... ] he told me he was just tired and fat and the wheezing was normal .\nStill I crashed on the floor next to him to make sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 mins and when I woke up he was no longer breathing .\nI immediately called 911 and they spent over an hour trying to bring him back however they were not successful .\nIt is with the heaviest heart I have to inform everyone that Trevor passed away at 307am last night and is no longer with us.\n\u201d Then he posted a picture of Bazile , underneath a rippling digital banner .\nIt read , \u201c Rest in Power.\n\u201d When Bazile \u2019 s friends first saw the posts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke .\nEven in the irony-saturated world he inhabited , who would announce a death that way ?\nBut it was true .\nBazile was dead .\nHe was only 25 .\nAccording to Trenny Hardy , Bazile \u2019 s mother , the New York City death certificate lists the cause as \u201c pending further study.\n\u201d On Oct. 29 , the NPCC Instagram made an announcement .\n\u201c He cared deeply about art , and the need for a kind of creative freedom and openness that could be wildly transgressive , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of NPC fest , he said it was because that \u2019 s what culture was turning everyone into\u2014people without independent thought\u2014and that by naming the fest NPC , we could reclaim this concept and cast a sort of spell to free everyone from it.\n\u201d \u201c NPC \u201d is an initialism from computer role-playing games , short for \u201c nonplayer character.\n\u201d It refers to a digital avatar that is controlled by the computer rather than by the player , a digital life running on a little loop .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of American culture in the 2020s : repetitive , preprogrammed , dull .\nBut blaming liberal politics for that repetition ignores deeper cultural tracks laid down over the past two decades by a handful of companies in Silicon Valley , owned and operated by a tiny group of billionaires .\nAny protest of that system from within can be copied , commodified , and turned into its own kind of script .\nSince Trevor Bazile \u2019 s death , there \u2019 s been sniping on Twitter about higher-profile , white posters stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking credit .\nAnd so much of his work has been scrubbed from the internet by Instagram that it \u2019 s hard to say what , exactly , Bazile left behind .\nFor an artist obsessed with taking up new kinds of space , he has in some ways already disappeared .\nHad Bazile lived , friends think he might have redefined indie film in New York or turned into a Virgil Abloh figure .\nIn five years , they say , we \u2019 ll catch up to what he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen , \u201d said Pedro Bello , the friend from Miami .\n\u201c He was still trapped pleasing people to reach his goals .\nHis sentence is not complete.\n\u201d In the end , the attempt to re-create in miniature the druggy , anything-goes downtown Manhattan of the 1990s ended with a brilliant young person dying .\nYou could call it ironic , if you wanted to .\nA deeper irony is that beneath the NPCC \u2019 s rhetoric of transgression lay a perfectly neat series of exchanges : money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity for clout , and so on .\nIndeed , Peter Thiel \u2019 s real influence over the \u201c postwoke , \u201d or the \u201c Post Left , \u201d or whatever this sensibility comes to be called , might be thought of in a different way .\nThe subculture has the same logic as the tech oligarchy that Thiel embodies .\nIt follows the same rules \u2014 imitate , iterate , transact .\nAt the screening of the Alex Jones documentary , the audience had to sign nondisclosure agreements : legal documents ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival .\nIt was all very Silicon Valley .\n\u25cf",

compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nTikTok has a way of making you want to get in on trends without any real evidence or proof that they work .\nIf Emily Mariko says to stick an ice cube in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I \u2019 m doing it .\nIf Millie Leer vouches that bar soap is the best product to laminate my brows , I \u2019 m slathering it in on .\nAnd if every single person I see is wearing butt-lifting leggings that seem to make their rear look higher , firmer , and rounder than ever before , I \u2019 m buying them .\nWhen it came to the TikTok leggings , however , there were a few problems : 1 ) I am frugal by nature and refuse to spend money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) I kept seeing options that looked slightly different yet nobody was calling out brand names , and I had to know which pair was best , and 3 ) I needed to know if they could actually be worn during exercise .\nFor the sake of journalism , I decided to break my first rule and buy both the Amazon Seasum Butt Lift Tights and the Halara Butt Lifting Leggings ( which my research showed to be the two most popular leggings on TikTok ) .\nBefore we dive in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m more of a sweatpants-to-lounge , leggings-to-work-out kind of gal .\nI rarely wear leggings without at least the intention of exercising at some point in the day , so it \u2019 s important to me that they are comfortable , flattering , and functional , which are the three categories I used to evaluate the leggings popular on TikTok .\nYes , a flattering look is still important because most gyms and workout studios have mirrors , and seeing a reflection that makes me feel good can give me the confidence I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in black .\nBlack and other similarly dark colors tend to be my default when it comes to leggings since I am a human who sweats when I work out .\nI prefer to not have that show through my pants , especially because that sweat generally comes through right around the crotch .\n( Although some high-quality colored leggings won \u2019 t show sweat either . )\nAs a 5-foot-6 woman , I \u2019 m slightly above average in height .\nI \u2019 ve been told that I have an athletic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , my butt is neither flat nor is it anything groundbreaking . )\nOverall I would call myself medium-size , but after looking at the sizing charts , reading some reviews , and knowing how I like my leggings to fit , I ordered a small in both pairs .\nYou can buy the Seasum High Waist Butt Lift Tights from Amazon for around $ 19 .\nYou can buy the In My Feels High Waisted Textured Butt Lifting 7/8 Leggings from Halara for around $ 28 .\nDo TikTok leggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that even Lizzo had gone with the Seasum butt-lifting leggings , I was understandably excited to try them out .\nI watched countless videos of people not only feeling themselves , but also filming the frankly shook reactions of their significant others upon seeing them in these leggings .\nSince most leggings I own already make my butt look decent ( if I do say so myself ) , I thought my life was about to be dramatically changed forever .\nI was wrong .\nUnfortunately , I give these a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my particular body .\nThey somehow flattened my butt while accentuating my hips and lower belly fat , which are two things I tend to want my leggings to flatten .\nI usually like a thicker waistband to compress that whole middle area and create more of an hourglass shape .\nThe Seasum butt-lift leggings did not do that for me , nor did they lift my butt .\nThey were also a bit long for my liking , basically meeting the tops of my ankle socks , which was surprising in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height .\nSome reviewers were on my side here : \u201c I was betrayed by a TikTok .\nThese make my butt look like a pancake and I actually have a butt so don \u2019 t be fooled by the TikTok .\nThese ain \u2019 t it hunny.\n\u201d \u2014Jord Others said that they can be super flattering on some bodies : \u201c So , uhh , yeah .\nIf you have a big butt and a smaller waist , get these pants .\nI \u2019 m 5 ' 9 '' and 230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XL fit perfectly .\nI haven \u2019 t taken a thot picture since my early 20 \u2019 s , but these pants looked so good there needed to be proof.\n\u201d \u2014Haley Havoc I found the Halara leggings to be slightly more flattering .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they did anything magical , they gave me a bit better shape in the waist through the hips .\nThey did not transform my butt , but they also didn \u2019 t flatten it .\nI preferred the length of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job of hiding any dimples in the skin .\nI \u2019 d give them a more medium-to-low score on the flatter meter .\nThe Amazon leggings were far superior to Halara when it came to comfort .\nThey had much more stretch despite the equally thick and bubbled texture .\nThe waistband , though not as wide as I \u2019 d like , did fit comfortably snug around my waist without causing too much fat to protrude over the top .\nA well-summarized review : \u201c The material is super soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe color is beautiful and they are so comfortable .\nThey are true to size as well which is nice .\nI have to say that at first , it felt like I had a wedgie all day because of the seam but I got used to it .\nAnd yes , it definitely accentuates your butt .\nI am very modest so I would not wear these out of the house but they are so comfortable I actually think I want to buy some more.\n\u201d \u2014Robyn I knew of Halara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dupes for trendy workout wear like the Outdoor Voices Exercise Dress , so I thought they would make comfortable leggings .\nHowever , I found these leggings to be difficult to pull on , and they felt strangely stiff for a piece of apparel designed to move in .\nThe top band was thick and a bit more flexible than the legs without that honeycomb texture , though it still didn \u2019 t have enough elastic to hug me the way I \u2019 d like .\nCan you exercise in TikTok leggings ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Seasum leggings won out .\nHowever , it \u2019 s important to note that most reviewers , and even a fitness expert , agree that functionality isn \u2019 t their strong suit .\n\u201c Do I think those leggings are leggings that I would wear to work out in ?\nAbsolutely not , \u201d Laura Pachnos , a senior coach at Solidcore in New York City , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Do I think they \u2019 re going to make you look great ?\nAbsolutely.\n\u201d I gave mine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y7 Studio .\nWhile they were admittedly not my favorite leggings to exercise in , they held up fine through the yoga flow .\nSince I opted for black , you couldn \u2019 t see any of the sweat even after 60 minutes of moving in a 90-degree room .\nAccording to Pachnos , who has a dance background and is certified in a wide variety of group fitness classes , it \u2019 s best to choose leggings specifically geared toward the type of workout you \u2019 ll be doing .\nSome may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tighter , or more supportive .\nUnless you plan to wear them only when lounging or running errands , they should have sweat-wicking technology .\nThe Amazon Seasum leggings do not have this feature .\n\u201c If you sweat in them , depending on the color , it looks like you peed yourself and feels heavy afterward , \u201d she said .\n( In case you were wondering , her favorites for any type of workout are from Sweaty Betty , which also has leggings that offer bum-sculpting benefits . )\nNearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seasum butt-lift leggings isn \u2019 t ideal for strenuous workouts , making them far better suited for lounging than exercise , but they were still miles ahead of Halara as far as functionality goes .\nI put on my Halara butt-lifting leggings for a workout with my trainer and almost immediately took them off .\nAfter moving my legs around a fairly minimal amount , I felt like the seam in the crotch might burst , which would not be ideal while doing squats and bear crawls at the gym .\nIt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable working out in them .\nGiven that the Halara leggings are more expensive than the Seasum leggings you can buy on Amazon and are only moderately more flattering ( in my opinion ) , I would buy them only if you heavily prioritize the butt-lifting appearance over everything else .\nOtherwise , I \u2019 d say the Seasum leggings are the way to go .\nWhile I didn \u2019 t feel that they were particularly flattering for my body type , many reviewers and TikTokers with other body types disagreed .\nStill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of wearing them for exercise .\n\u201c They are made for lounging , \u201d Pachnos said .\n\u201c If you were going to pair them with a cute chunky sweater and some Converse to go out for your morning coffee , that \u2019 s when I \u2019 d wear those leggings .\n\u201d",

        "content": "The party on Eldridge Street could hardly be contained : Bodies spilled out of the front door onto the sidewalk , and joyous screams echoed from the roof .\nInside , under the wood beams of the $ 7.5 million carriage house , a DJ played techno for a young and queer crowd .\nAmid throngs of twentysomethings who were pierced and shorn in unusual places , a performance artist named Crackhead Barney roamed around in a Trump mask , breasts bared , past a man painted green from head to toe , wearing only a jockstrap and an alligator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOver the sound of a jazz band , the screams were now clearer : \u201c This is being paid for by Peter Thiel !\n\u201d At the center of the pandemonium was a young artist from Miami named Trevor Bazile .\nDressed inconspicuously in a baggy hoodie and jeans , he raced from conversation to conversation , stopping along the way to pluck at a stand-up bass and then to bounce around an art installation set inside a children \u2019 s blow-up castle .\nA chaotic mix of short films , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dance parties , NPCC brought together respected independent filmmakers , hard-right software developers , leftist DJs , and queer performance artists .\nIt built buzz through a new downtown media scene that revolves around a handful of interlocking podcasts with provocative politics .\n( The hosts of Red Scare , the most popular of those shows , interviewed legendary cult filmmaker John Waters on NPCC \u2019 s first night . )\nThe fest \u2019 s aesthetic was one of deliberate bad taste \u2014 official T-shirts depicted the Statue of Liberty dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Worst Is Yet to Come.\n\u201d But in 2022 , bad taste carries a political charge .\nThe NPCC acquired a derisive nickname during its planning : the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d In part , that \u2019 s because rumors of right-wing funding swirled around the festival in the months leading up to it .\nBut the label reflects something trickier to define , a broader sense that there is a core of young artists and trendsetters in New York and Los Angeles who , post-Trump , are rediscovering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you must , a vibe shift : a new generation of internet-native tastemakers \u2014 like many of the people crowded into Bazile \u2019 s party \u2014 who find the moralistic gatekeeping of millennials all a bit pass\u00e9 .\nA youthful subculture that rejects liberal pieties naturally excites the American right .\nIt \u2019 s a sign of the pendulum swinging , a chance to break the culture war stalemate of the Trump years .\nThiel , who did not comment for this story , has called identity politics an \u201c insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weakens the United States .\nAn investment in a culture of cool that declares \u201c wokeness \u201d unfashionable , like an investment in politicians who attack the teaching of critical race theory in schools or an investment that steers kids away from college , is a way of disconnecting the next generation from the power grid of contemporary liberalism .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of disruption .\nBut the allure of such a shift stretches beyond MAGA Republicans .\nThere \u2019 s a diverse coalition of Americans who resent the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled liberals who think aspects of # MeToo and the racial justice movement are excessive or cynically self-promotional , media figures who have built lucrative careers banging on about \u201c cancel culture , \u201d and artists and writers of previous generations who find the current cultural constraints intolerable .\n`` Transgressive organizations like the \u2018 New People \u2019 s Cinema Club \u2019 must survive because they help keep devious ideas near and dear to the hearts of the young , '' Waters wrote in an email .\nSelf-aware and supremely ironic creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwoke \u201d set understand that they are useful to the right and even joke about it .\nBazile knew he had been cast for a part in someone else \u2019 s vision of the future .\nBut he accepted the role because he saw in it the chance to pursue his own radical creative agenda \u2014 a dynamic nearly as old as art patronage itself .\nAfter the NPCC , a meme went around that depicted a large puppet , labeled \u201c Trevor Bazile , \u201d holding a smaller puppet , labeled \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding an even smaller puppet , which was labeled \u201c Peter Thiel.\n\u201d The image has a knowingly absurd implication : that an unknown young filmmaker , of all people , could manipulate an oligarch who is known as a right-wing puppet master .\nBut it also contains a more complex truth .\nFor Bazile , who above all was aware of the way he was being used , Peter Thiel \u2019 s money was an opportunity to build a new space in the rubble of American culture .\nIn 2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repertory movie theater in Los Angeles .\nPlaying a mix of strange , forgotten , and contemporary films , the theater quickly turned into \u201c an epicenter of young Hollywood , \u201d according to Variety .\nThen , in August 2017 , a widely distributed anonymous email accused Belove of \u201c sexual harassment , assault , and abuse by former employees and volunteers.\n\u201d Though he denied the allegations , calling them \u201c demonstrable lies and half-truths , \u201d Belove resigned from Cinefamily days after the email was sent .\nOne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belove was a young film editor named Alex Lee Moyer , who had an idea for a documentary .\nThe film would be about a group of driftless young men who gather on 4chan and Twitter to vent their frustration with their lack of romantic and professional prospects .\nBelove was drawn to the subject matter .\nHe felt that these young men had been swept up in an online moral panic ( this one over \u201c incels \u201d ) and that a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary about their lives would make clear how overblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Moyer with the film , TFW NO GF ( imageboard shorthand for \u201c that feeling when no girlfriend.\n\u201d ) Right-wing politics hovered at the edges of the production ; 3D-printed guns advocate Cody Wilson was an early financial supporter .\nBut the documentary itself is affectless , refraining from any judgment of its subjects .\nIn March 2020 , as Belove and Moyer were preparing to screen the film at the South by Southwest festival , they attended a live taping in Los Angeles of Other Life , a podcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe guest was Curtis Yarvin , a prolific blogger and software developer who first achieved notice under the pseudonym \u201c Mencius Moldbug.\n\u201d Writing as Moldbug from 2007 to 2014 , Yarvin became synonymous with \u201c neoreaction , \u201d an abstruse political philosophy that prefers rational authoritarianism to democracy .\nTo the extent that Yarvin is held to be dangerous rather than offensive or kooky , it is because of the sense that he represents an unexpressed current of antidemocratic belief in Silicon Valley .\nBut when Belove listened to Yarvin speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent bong-hit philosopher .\nCurtis Yarvin \u2019 s relationship with Peter Thiel is both well documented and incompletely understood .\nOn the one hand , Yarvin is close enough with Thiel to have watched the 2016 election at the venture capitalist \u2019 s home and to have taken the billionaire \u2019 s investment capital for his startup , Tlon .\n( He also has emailed about politics with Thiel since at least 2013 . )\nOn the other hand , Thiel has invested in a variety of quixotic ventures , including 3D-printed meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be a mug \u2019 s game to try to disentangle Thiel \u2019 s economic interests from his political commitments from his flights of intellectual fancy from the pet projects of his friends .\nStill , to the degree Thiel embodies Silicon Valley \u2019 s contrarianism , cultural insecurity , and nose for a new market , a \u201c postwoke \u201d film company seemed like a natural fit .\nThiel \u2019 s investments in politics have been high profile and consequential , but his ventures in culture and media \u2014 beyond funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been scattershot .\nIn 2018 , BuzzFeed News revealed that Thiel had considered creating a conservative news network ; nothing came of it .\nHe funded the conservative political journal American Affairs , a contrarian science quarterly , and , according to a recent biography , the \u201c heterodox \u201d website Quillette .\nThe Thiel Foundation subsidiary Imitatio , dedicated to the thought of the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard , once purchased a table at a benefit put on by n+1 , a leftist literary magazine .\nIt \u2019 s unclear exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play Nice Ltd. , which Belove registered in California in September 2020 .\n( According to Belove , there are multiple investors , including others from the tech industry . )\nBut at times , Thiel \u2019 s employees have been closely involved in Belove \u2019 s activities .\nIn July 2021 , Belove screened films and partied at the Cannes Film Festival with Jimmy Kaltreider , the executive director of the Thiel Foundation .\nIn texts , Belove referred to members of Thiel Capital as his \u201c traveling companions \u201d and mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaltreider .\nBy this point , Belove had cycled through several ideas for Play Nice .\nIt could be a seed fund , or a production company , or maybe even a streaming service .\nStill , he was at heart a film programmer , and he loved the idea of a festival .\nIn LA , Belove \u2019 s name was toxic .\nBut he knew New York had a thriving young cultural scene , one nostalgic for an authentic city it never knew but half-remembered through the risk-taking films of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially inspired by the notorious , defunct New York Underground Film Festival , Belove reached out in April 2021 to Ed Halter , its former director .\n\u201c I got funding to support a new york underground film fest bringing together the new dirtbag film scene , \u201d Belove wrote in an email .\n\u201c I want to help expand it .\nWe want to be all over town , pop-ups , secret screenings , no website , text invites like rave [ ... ] real underground.\n\u201d Belove didn \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he knew his name would be a distraction .\nSo who could help him find and mentor the young artists he wanted to attract ?\nBelove had been collaborating on Play Nice with Lucas Leyva , the founder of a well-regarded Miami film collective called the Borscht Corporation .\nAnd Leyva said that he knew an extraordinary person who was just right for the job of creative director .\nTrevor Bazile knew what the culture saw when it looked at him : a \u201c royal flush of identities , \u201d as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Black , he was queer , he didn \u2019 t have money , and he was the child of a Haitian immigrant .\nHe was also , according to nearly everyone who encountered him , some kind of genius .\nIn 2017 , Bazile turned up at Borscht to volunteer and never really left .\nStarted in 2005 by Leyva , Borscht had a well-earned reputation for developing the talents of untrained , often first-generation American filmmakers .\nOscar-winning director Barry Jenkins made a short film for Borscht , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d without the collective .\nAs Borscht built its name , it drew investment from major institutional supporters of the arts , including the Knight Foundation , Time Warner , and the Andy Warhol Foundation .\nBy the time Bazile arrived , Borscht was already an established draw for eccentric young artists .\nInspired by the idea of an authentic culture in a city known for its superficial glitz , Borscht fellows were a mix of posh kids with prestigious arts training and local kids from working-class families .\n( The program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s grandson . )\nIt was an exciting , combustible combination .\nBazile stood out immediately .\n\u201c His brain was glow-in-the-dark , special , \u201d Leyva said .\n\u201c He thought differently from anyone else.\n\u201d Bazile made formally inventive , jazz-inflected short films , but also sculptures and installations .\nHe would sleep in the Borscht space , located in an old mall in downtown Miami , and it became a second home .\nHe started to lead a group of fellows who gave themselves the name \u201c Bisque \u201d ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmmakers that \u201c we \u2019 re young , and I think we \u2019 re more talented.\n\u201d In January 2020 , a woman published a blog post ( since removed ) accusing Lucas Leyva of sexual assault .\nLeyva insists that the encounter was consensual , as does a second woman who participated ; he filed a defamation suit , which is ongoing .\nBefore he resigned as president , Leyva lobbied the Borscht board to replace him with Bazile .\nThey turned Leyva \u2019 s request down .\n( It ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its support , and today Borscht is essentially defunct . )\nBazile \u2019 s professional ambitions had been denied .\nWith Borscht crumbling , he had lost the space and the money to make art .\nThen the coronavirus closed down the city .\nFriends who came from money retreated to the safety of their family homes .\nBazile lashed out on social media against people he thought were trying to take down Borscht .\nHe spent more of his time on Instagram , making a name for himself in the obscure reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed communities of posters who make densely ironic memes about topics like anarcho-capitalism and French philosopher Gilles Deleuze .\nDuring the George Floyd protests , as Instagram filled up with black squares and calls for donations to racial justice causes of varying seriousness , Bazile told friends that he was overcome by cynicism .\nWith his \u201c royal flush \u201d of identities , cancel culture should work for him , he said to a friend .\nBut here he was without prospects , all because of Borscht being canceled .\nMeanwhile , wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t care about him or Black people in general , were making symbolic gestures \u2014 chasing clout \u2014 on social media .\nBazile told friends that he was drawn to Afropessimism , a bleak philosophy of race arguing that anti-Black violence is so fundamental to the nature of Western society that the only way to end it would be to end the world as we know it .\nIn a December 2020 appearance on the cult film podcast The Ion Pack , Bazile said that around this time , he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown.\n\u201d But the trip led to a moment of clarity : The culture that had robbed him had its own rules , which he could use to his advantage .\n\u201c If I act like how people on these apps are acting , who are trying to chase social capital by canceling people , I need to participate in this market , \u201d he said on the podcast .\nCancellation was a form of currency , maybe the only one he had .\n\u201c That \u2019 s when I started shitposting \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI haven \u2019 t stopped since then.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to explain what Bazile did on Instagram starting in mid-2020 .\nFirst of all , he kept getting banned , so only one of his accounts , @ all_triggers _no _warnings , is still accessible .\nSecond , he posted things that are so offensive they are tricky to describe .\nHe posted at such a blistering pace and in such contradictory ways that to fasten it down with adjectives feels beside the point .\nBazile posted pro-Trump memes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in blackface , memes mocking anti-fat discourse , a photograph of a Hegel T-shirt , hundreds of bizarre and abject clips he found on TikTok , a drawing of a Black man performing fellatio on a white penis at the summit of a milk crate challenge .\nHe took so many political stances that he seemed to be mocking the idea of having a political stance at all .\nHe gained access to a massively ironic Instagram collective called the Incellectuals , then got booted for being too offensive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cult figure .\n\u201c Ironic Blackness needs to take up digital space , \u201d he said in the Ion Pack interview .\nLeftists were taking back online irony from \u201c alt-right motherfuckers , \u201d he said , and centrists just couldn \u2019 t deal .\nOne of his gimmicks was to respond to offended white commenters with a link to his Cash App , as if to say , If you want me to read your opinion , you have to pay me .\nThese payments kept Bazile afloat for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at an upscale ice cream parlor .\nHe didn \u2019 t have a car ; he begged for rides ; he crashed on couches .\nWhen Leyva asked him whether he wanted to be the creative director of the NPCC , he said yes .\nSome of Bazile \u2019 s friends were unsettled that he was going to work for a festival that was funded by Thiel \u2019 s money and created by a disgraced man plotting a second act .\nIn long arguments over Instagram DMs that summer , Bazile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to make work that conventional patrons would never support .\n\u201c There was a constant fight between what he wanted to say and what a liberal institution would want him to say or make work about , \u201d Pedro Bello , a friend of his , told me .\nHe also made it clear that his relationships with Belove and Thiel were transactional .\nHe knew he was a convenient face for the festival , but he knew NPCC was an opportunity .\nThat was the exchange : Use and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he wanted to do , \u201d said a friend of Bazile \u2019 s , who asked that I identify him by his Instagram handle , @ gaypanique2 .\n\u201c He saw it as a wager .\nThe wager he was making was , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to deal with these unsavory people.\n\u2019 It was very practical .\nHe was not hiding anything .\n\u2018 I \u2019 m poor , I need money , I need money to do art .\nWhat does it matter if it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving it to me ?\nWe \u2019 re going to celebrate and laugh in the face of destruction.\n\u2019 \u201d Bazile arrived in New York in July 2021 , rented an apartment in Brooklyn , and went about trying to organize a film festival .\nHe had to contend with Hadrian Belove \u2019 s reputation .\nCinefamily \u2019 s implosion had left a crater in the independent film scene in LA , and now Belove had shown up on the East Coast , trailed by rumors that he had financial support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his two young co-organizers down , unwilling or afraid to participate in what had become known unofficially as the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d But Bazile had cachet among a new clique of Instagram-obsessed Manhattan scenesters .\nAt a July party at Russian Samovar thrown by The Ion Pack and cohosted by influencer Caroline Calloway , Leyva watched , amused , as a crowd of people formed around his old fellow , hoping to meet Trevor \u201c Memes \u201d Bazile .\n( A Grub Street party report described the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , very online people.\n\u201d ) It was the exact scene Belove had hoped to leverage .\nBazile and his co-organizers slowly put together a lineup of 23 films .\nIt included screenings of a debut by a high school teacher , an Austrian movie about an android , two older works involving literary men in various stages of post-cancellation cultural limbo , and the debut of a short film by Kids director Larry Clark .\nAlex Lee Moyer screened a cut of her follow-up to TFW NO GF , a strenuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUp until the last minute , the NPCC suffered cancellations \u2014 real ones .\nClark fell out for medical reasons , then The Ion Pack hosts , who were set to interview the filmmaker , withdrew .\nThen noise band Wolf Eyes dropped out .\nThe Ace Hotel was originally supposed to host Bazile \u2019 s big party but backed out after staffers were alarmed by offensive jokes on the NPCC \u2019 s Twitter account , which Bazile ran .\n\u201c The central themes of our festival are around transgression and deplatformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to an Ace spokesperson .\n\u201c In contemporary liberal art spaces , especially those that exist online , whenever an artist engages themes of transgression or subversion they are assumed to be right wing , or white supremacist , regardless of the intent or content of their work.\n\u201d Then , only a week before the festival was set to begin , a Brooklyn synagogue informed the organizers that it would no longer host Red Scare and John Waters because anonymous callers had claimed the festival was antisemitic .\nThe best-known filmmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was Caveh Zahedi , whose documentaries the New York Times called in a 2019 profile \u201c abject , self-defeating , ethically questionable , and maddeningly original.\n\u201d Friends and colleagues at the New School tried to talk him out of doing the festival because of the Thiel money , a request he found hypocritical given the compromised nature of film funding in general .\n\u201c A lot of the grants people get come from horrible abuses that generate tons of profit that make philanthropy possible in the first place , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s most loved films , The Sheik and I , was originally commissioned for the 2011 Sharjah Biennial on the theme of \u201c art as a subversive act.\n\u201d The film Zahedi ended up making so ruthlessly satirized the United Arab Emirates that it was banned , and the director himself was threatened with arrest .\nIn Zahedi \u2019 s world , it doesn \u2019 t make sense for an artist to reject bad money , because the system that gives the money value is itself bad ; rather , the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a statement .\nBut what kind of statement did Bazile want to make ?\nA dedicated observer of the strange and shifting politics of the internet might squint and see in his NPCC something like a coming-out party for the \u201c Post Left , \u201d a strange and shifting term .\nDerided by journalist Carl Beijer as \u201c an internet clique waiting on a check , \u201d the \u201c Post Left \u201d sometimes refers to a group of online media figures who reject the American left as insufficiently radical and align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore importantly , it describes a chaotic internet subculture that is closely associated with the depressive outlook of Gen Z \u2014 the milieu in which Bazile had become a minor star .\nBetter thought of as an attitude than a coherent politics , this \u201c Post Left \u201d associates identity politics with self-righteous millennials and confused boomers .\nSo too does it reject electoral politics , which it sees as fatally compromised by capitalism and preposterously insufficient to the task of addressing the climate crisis .\nGleefully ironic , this sensibility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the sympathetic position that the most appropriate response to the end of the world might be to laugh and play .\nEspecially if Peter Thiel is paying .\nSeveral months after the festival , Nile Harris , Bazile \u2019 s collaborator , posted to Instagram a picture of the pair on the Eldridge Street roof , standing inside a deflated blow-up castle in front of a painted white brick wall .\nIn the photograph , they both stare into the camera .\n\u201c Peter Thiel bought me a house , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a home.\n\u201d \u201c It felt like , look at what we can do with his money , \u201d one attendee said .\n\u201c Look at what we \u2019 re doing with your money , you dick.\n\u201d Generations of artists have defined themselves by rebelling against the values of the bourgeoisie .\nBut a subculture based on transgressing bourgeois norms in 2021 faces a trap : It can look indistinguishable from Trumpism .\nThe distinction between shocking liberals as an aesthetic goal and a political one starts to blur .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world an original cultural sensibility , but it also gave the world Gavin McInnes , the founder of the Proud Boys .\nWhile working on her documentary about Alex Jones , Moyer attended the Jan. 6 \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally ; that day , she posted to Instagram a photograph in the hotel room of pro-Trump indie musician Ariel Pink , who did the soundtrack for TFW NO GF and had attended the rally in support of the former President .\nThe attempt to re-create a scuzzy hipster nihilism \u2014 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most notorious financier \u2014 feels to some like the farce arriving before the tragedy has even ended .\nThat \u2019 s why Ed Halter , the old New York Underground Film Festival organizer , never responded to Hadrian Belove \u2019 s email .\n\u201c I have a Gen X embarrassment about this myself , \u201d said Halter , who is now a critic in residence at Bard College .\n\u201c I understand why they reached out to me .\nFor that very reason I did not want to be any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2019 90s was anti-political , whereas now it \u2019 s being harnessed to a cynical right-wing politics .\nAnd I feel old enough now to see the trick.\n\u201d What makes the new transgressive culture more complicated is it sees the trick as well \u2014 and folds it into the joke .\nIndeed , \u201c Thiel as fascist paymaster \u201d is now such a media trope that it has become a kind of meme in the Post Left , with associated microcelebrities joking about `` needing Thiel money '' or being Venmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d as Post Left internet communities sometimes call them , are , in this sense , less important as a source of income than as a shock tactic ; claiming them , ironically or otherwise , confers its own bizarro credibility .\nIn the days leading up to the NPCC festival , Bazile had confided in Gaypanique that he feared there was no organic reason for it to exist beyond Thiel \u2019 s money and Belove \u2019 s ego .\nSo when Gaypanique saw Bazile on the last day of the festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off something on his own terms .\nBut Bazile scoffed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I have the capacity to do this anymore , \u201d he said , cryptically , about the festival .\n\u201c I need you to rip it to shreds.\n\u201d That night , a Philadelphia bartender named Victor Kane , who owns a popular meme account on Instagram called @ chethanxfinsta , arrived in Brooklyn to find Bazile distraught .\nEarly the next morning , Kane posted an Instagram story .\nOn top of a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the night at Bazile \u2019 s apartment : \u201c When I got there he looked like he had way too much to drink [ ... ] We went out and grabbed a couple drinks and returned to the Airbnb to chill and fall asleepv .\nI told him that I was worried bc he was covered in sweat and was wheezing [ ... ] he told me he was just tired and fat and the wheezing was normal .\nStill I crashed on the floor next to him to make sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 mins and when I woke up he was no longer breathing .\nI immediately called 911 and they spent over an hour trying to bring him back however they were not successful .\nIt is with the heaviest heart I have to inform everyone that Trevor passed away at 307am last night and is no longer with us.\n\u201d Then he posted a picture of Bazile , underneath a rippling digital banner .\nIt read , \u201c Rest in Power.\n\u201d When Bazile \u2019 s friends first saw the posts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke .\nEven in the irony-saturated world he inhabited , who would announce a death that way ?\nBut it was true .\nBazile was dead .\nHe was only 25 .\nAccording to Trenny Hardy , Bazile \u2019 s mother , the New York City death certificate lists the cause as \u201c pending further study.\n\u201d On Oct. 29 , the NPCC Instagram made an announcement .\n\u201c He cared deeply about art , and the need for a kind of creative freedom and openness that could be wildly transgressive , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of NPC fest , he said it was because that \u2019 s what culture was turning everyone into\u2014people without independent thought\u2014and that by naming the fest NPC , we could reclaim this concept and cast a sort of spell to free everyone from it.\n\u201d \u201c NPC \u201d is an initialism from computer role-playing games , short for \u201c nonplayer character.\n\u201d It refers to a digital avatar that is controlled by the computer rather than by the player , a digital life running on a little loop .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of American culture in the 2020s : repetitive , preprogrammed , dull .\nBut blaming liberal politics for that repetition ignores deeper cultural tracks laid down over the past two decades by a handful of companies in Silicon Valley , owned and operated by a tiny group of billionaires .\nAny protest of that system from within can be copied , commodified , and turned into its own kind of script .\nSince Trevor Bazile \u2019 s death , there \u2019 s been sniping on Twitter about higher-profile , white posters stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking credit .\nAnd so much of his work has been scrubbed from the internet by Instagram that it \u2019 s hard to say what , exactly , Bazile left behind .\nFor an artist obsessed with taking up new kinds of space , he has in some ways already disappeared .\nHad Bazile lived , friends think he might have redefined indie film in New York or turned into a Virgil Abloh figure .\nIn five years , they say , we \u2019 ll catch up to what he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen , \u201d said Pedro Bello , the friend from Miami .\n\u201c He was still trapped pleasing people to reach his goals .\nHis sentence is not complete.\n\u201d In the end , the attempt to re-create in miniature the druggy , anything-goes downtown Manhattan of the 1990s ended with a brilliant young person dying .\nYou could call it ironic , if you wanted to .\nA deeper irony is that beneath the NPCC \u2019 s rhetoric of transgression lay a perfectly neat series of exchanges : money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity for clout , and so on .\nIndeed , Peter Thiel \u2019 s real influence over the \u201c postwoke , \u201d or the \u201c Post Left , \u201d or whatever this sensibility comes to be called , might be thought of in a different way .\nThe subculture has the same logic as the tech oligarchy that Thiel embodies .\nIt follows the same rules \u2014 imitate , iterate , transact .\nAt the screening of the Alex Jones documentary , the audience had to sign nondisclosure agreements : legal documents ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival .\nIt was all very Silicon Valley .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden \u2019 s Supreme Court pick Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has a lengthy track record of decisions on major topics from her nine years on the bench , from presidential power to immigration and conspiracy theories .\nJackson was only confirmed to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit last year , meaning she \u2019 s had little time to publish precedent-setting opinions .\nBut in her longer tenure on the federal district court bench in Washington \u2014 she was confirmed in 2010 \u2014 she had plenty of opportunities to rule in high-profile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big cases and key issues that could get a close look as her confirmation proceedings unfold in the US Senate : The scope of a person \u2019 s right to an abortion has been a flashpoint for recent Supreme Court nominations , but Jackson has never ruled in a case that dealt squarely with the issue .\nHer previous promotion , from district court judge to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit , earned praise from liberal advocacy groups , including NARAL Pro-Choice America .\nAsked during those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roe v. Wade was correctly decided , Jackson declined to answer , explaining it would be \u201c inappropriate \u201d since all Supreme Court decisions were binding on her as a lower court judge .\nIt \u2019 s a question that \u2019 s sure to come up again now that she \u2019 s nominated for the high court .\nThere \u2019 s a case pending before the justices that could dramatically upend the nationwide landscape of abortion rights by the end of this term , but its unlikely to end the fight altogether .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions came in late 2019 , when she concluded that then-president Donald Trump \u2019 s first White House counsel Don McGahn could not claim absolute immunity against a congressional subpoena to testify in the Russia investigation .\nMcGahn had played a star role in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s report .\nOnce Mueller \u2019 s office finished its work without bringing charges against Trump , Democrats in Congress wanted to pick up the thread with McGahn .\nBacked by the Justice Department under Trump , McGahn argued that current and former senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against congressional subpoenas , that the president had the final word on when to assert that immunity , and that courts lacked authority to intervene .\nJackson rejected all of the DOJ \u2019 s positions .\nHer opinion was stacked with sweeping declarations about how every person , including the president , ultimately is bound by the law .\nMcGahn could refuse to answer certain questions on executive privilege grounds , but he had to show up , she found .\n\u201c Stated simply , the primary takeaway from the past 250 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not kings , \u201d Jackson wrote .\nShe continued later : \u201c ... compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct , not a political one , and per the Constitution , no one is above the law .\nThat is to say , however busy or essential a presidential aide might be , and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects , the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires.\n\u201d The case ping-ponged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and a half on the question of whether the court had authority to hear it .\nThe first time it went up on appeal , a three-judge panel ruled 2-1 to dismiss the case , but then the full court sided with Jackson and ruled it could go forward .\nThe Trump administration raised a second challenge on different grounds , and the DC Circuit again ruled 2-1 to toss it out .\nBefore the full court could weigh in again , McGahn reached an agreement to testify , ending the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DC Circuit judge , Jackson has had a chance to weigh in on the latest round of fights over congressional demands for information related to Trump .\nIn December , she was part of a three-judge panel that unanimously rejected Trump \u2019 s last-ditch effort to stop the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection from getting certain archived White House records .\nYears before thousands of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol \u2014 a mob that included followers of the QAnon collective delusion \u2014 there was Pizzagate .\nSpurred by baseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives were involved in a child sex trafficking network with a connection to DC restaurant Comet Ping Pong , Edgar Maddison Welch traveled to DC from his home in North Carolina and entered the pizzeria with two loaded firearms .\nWelch searched the restaurant as patrons fled ; he claimed he was looking for kidnapped children .\nNo one was injured , but he fired an assault rifle to try to break the lock of a door and pointed the gun at an employee .\nHe was immediately taken into custody .\nWelch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson in June 2017 .\nShe sentenced him to four years in prison , which was more than the 18 months Welch \u2019 s lawyer argued for and slightly below the 4.5 years the government wanted .\nJackson said she believed Welch thought he was doing the right thing by going into the restaurant , but that didn \u2019 t excuse him from following the law \u2014 \u201c acting violently even for good causes is not okay , \u201d she said .\nShe spoke about grappling with how to craft a sentence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who were consuming the same information online that inspired Welch .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bThe fear is now that , even though no one was physically harmed in this case , other people who are worried about other issues will take up arms with the intent of sacrificing lives in order to achieve what they believe is a just result .\nAnd as I 'm sure you know , that kind of system of justice is utterly incompatible with our constitutional scheme and with the rule of law , \u201d Jackson said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial in the context of this case.\n\u201d Welch \u2019 s case did not end the conspiracy theories that motivated him , instead morphing into an integral part of the QAnon delusions .\nWhen a coalition of immigrant rights group \u2019 s challenged the Trump administration \u2019 s plan to expand the category of undocumented immigrants eligible for fast-track deportations , the case landed before Jackson .\nIn September 2019 , she issued a preliminary injunction blocking the changes .\nJackson found that the challengers were likely to succeed in arguing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt the policy in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act , which requires agencies to take \u201c into account all of the facts and circumstances that are relevant to their consequential policy determinations.\n\u201d Specifically , Jackson found that DHS had failed to explore existing problems with the expedited removal process as well as the

expand fast-track deportations was the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APA .\nBut the circuit agreed with Jackson that the court could hear the case in the first place , and also found that she was on firm legal ground in blocking the policy as a whole nationwide , versus only as it applied to the groups that sued .\nThe Trump administration and conservative legal advocates criticized judges who entered nationwide injunctions halting his policies .\nJackson wrote at length in defense of the scope of her order , saying the government had \u201c conjured up a strawman \u201d in arguing that @ @ @ @ @ @

policy \u2026 reverberates nationally , that is simply and solely because DHS previously decided to apply its potentially defective rule nationwide , \u201d she wrote .\nAlso in September 2019 , Jackson gave the Trump administration a win in a different fight over its immigration policies .\nShe dismissed a challenge brought by environmental groups to the DHS secretary \u2019 s decision to waive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed up construction of barriers along the US\u2013Mexico border .\nJackson found that Congress had barred most legal challenges to these types of waivers and also that arguments contesting the constitutionality of the secretary \u2019 s waiver power fell short .\nIn October 2020 , Jackson sided with immigrant advocacy groups who sued the Trump administration over a lesson plan used to train federal immigration officers who screen potential asylum seekers slated for fast-track deportations .\nThe challengers argued the language adopted in 2019 wrongly raised the bar too high for the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person had shown a \u201c credible fear \u201d of persecution in their home country .\nJackson agreed .\nThe Justice Department decided not to pursue an appeal .\nLabor groups \u2014 longtime allies of Biden \u2014 were vocal about wanting a nominee with a record of backing workers \u2019 rights .\nJackson \u2019 s first written opinion as a DC Circuit judge was a win for federal employees .\nIn a 3-0 decision earlier this month , the court struck down a 2020 policy change by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in collective bargaining before making changes to work conditions .\nBefore the new policy , agencies had to bargain unless the changes would have a \u201c de minimis , \u201d or minimal , effect .\nThe new policy stated that agencies didn \u2019 t have to bargain unless a change would have a \u201c substantial impact.\n\u201d Public sector unions argued this created a new class of management decisions falling between \u201c de minimis \u201d and \u201c substantial \u201d that employers would no longer have to bargain over .\nJackson wrote that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t \u201c sufficiently reasoned.\n\u201d As a district court judge , Jackson presided over a set of challenges by federal labor unions to three executive orders issued by Trump that gave agencies new directives about how

challenged orders violated federal law .\nNo presidential order could \u201c operate to eviscerate the right to bargain collectively , \u201d she wrote , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumulative effect.\n\u201d

second- , fourth- , fifth- , sixth- , and seventh-largest fires since at least 1932 when reliable record-keeping began , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .\nThe Pacific Northwest also experienced its deadliest heat wave on record .\nTennessee was hit by record rainfall for a 24-hour period , and similar records were obliterated in the Northeast due to the remnants of Hurricane Ida .\nMy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on record .\nOr the second-hottest year , depending on the analysis .\n2020 was the year that Australia burned in its deadly Bushfire season and a record number of locusts swarmed the Horn of Africa \u2014 both calamities expected in a warming climate .\n\u201c There are a ton of options , \u201d said Edward Carr of Clark University , a coauthor of the new report .\nThe biggest tragedy , he added , would be if we don \u2019 t act now on the climate solutions we already have .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair thing to do to a generation of kids coming up right now.\n\u201d But my daughter \u2019 s future is not already doomed .\nThat \u2019 s a key takeaway from the more than 3,000-page report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which outlines the many ways that society can act to not only better respond and adapt to the warming that \u2019 s here , but also stave off a perilously hot world of no return .\nA new climate report released this week , called \u201c Climate Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d makes clear that climate impacts will permeate her childhood .\nIt also details how kids worldwide are especially vulnerable to the crisis , with even more warming on the way .\nMy daughter is not yet 2 years old .\nIn her short life , she has only known a world dramatically altered by human-made climate change .\nIn her lifetime , she will face a future of worse floods , heat waves , droughts , extinctions , and more calamities ensured by continually rising temperatures .\nOn August 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings were destroyed by deadly flooding days before in Waverly , Tennessee .\n( Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images ) Elsewhere in the world , mudslides blanketed Japan \u2019 s town of Atami in Shizuoka prefecture , entire villages were inundated by torrential downpours in Western Germany , and a wildfire destroyed Canada \u2019 s town of Lytton .\nSome of these disasters pose real risks of physical harm to kids .\nTake extreme heat and heat waves : Pregnant people , babies , and young kids are all more vulnerable to heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies aren \u2019 t as good at cooling and staying that way .\nStudies even show that an unborn child \u2019 s exposure to extreme heat while in the womb could result in negative health outcomes later , such as lower birth weight .\nFor older kids , as the number of hot days increases with global warming , they risk greater exposure to the heat in schools without air conditioning and during outdoor activities , like sports .\nThis latest IPCC assessment also discusses how disasters , both the acute exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one , can damage the mental health and well-being of everyone impacted , especially kids .\nAfter major flooding occurred in the United Kingdom in 2000 , for instance , researchers tracked the health of people whose homes flooded and did not flood , according to Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington , who helped co-write the report \u2019 s chapter on health .\n\u201c There was a very clear difference in probable anxiety , depression , and post-traumatic stress disorder \u201d between the different groups , she explained .\nHeadline-spurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more intense , are perhaps the most obvious signs of how 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming , compared to pre-industrial times , is playing out .\nBut there are far more climate impacts already here , as the new report exhaustively details .\nEven before my daughter was born , for example , two species went extinct and climate change played a role : the Golden toad in Costa Rica in 1990 , as well as Australia \u2019 s Bramble Cay melomys , a type of rodent , in 2016 .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction : Australia \u2019 s lemuroid ringtail possum .\nAnd there have been far more local extinctions : Climate-linked local extinctions were detected in 47 % of 976 animal and plant species examined .\nThe impact of climate change on top of existing problems of food availability and high prices can be a \u201c lethal combination for kids , \u201d said Rachel Bezner Kerr of Cornell University , a coauthor on the IPCC chapter on food systems , \u201c especially in low-income countries , especially low-income households , especially in rural areas.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed between 1993 and 2012 , increased temperatures was significantly related to children \u2019 s wasting in 30 countries in Africa , \u201d she added .\nWasting refers to a child that is too thin for their height , according to the World Health Organization .\nMalnutrition is already a huge problem in kids in certain developing nations , and that problem will only get bigger in a warmer world if action isn \u2019 t specifically taken to avoid that possibility .\nHow Hot Will It Get In My Daughter \u2019 s Lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate agreement in 2016 , they agreed to jointly limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius ( about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) , ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius .\nNow scientists predict that it is \u201c more likely than not \u201d that global average temperatures will pass 1.5 degrees in the coming decades , no matter what .\nIt could happen by 2030 , when my daughter is only 12 years old .\nThat \u2019 s why the next few years matter so much .\nHow quickly people cut their greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the 1.5-degree threshold is exceeded and what happens next .\nWill temperatures keep going up or will they start to come back down ?\nMoreover , what people do now to start adapting to the warming that \u2019 s already here and locked in for the future will minimize the damage associated with the crisis .\nBy 2030 , for example , it \u2019 s possible that countries will embrace the bold goal of protecting at least 30 % of the planet \u2019 s land and water .\nIf so , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some species alive to bolstering natural ecosystems that protect against floods , help suck up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere , and do much more .\nAnd if China transitioned to a half-decarbonized power supply for homes and vehicles by 2030 , per the report , the country could expect to prevent 55,000-69,000 deaths in that year .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that urban areas may see their exposure to flooding go up 2.7 times by 2030 compared to 2000 , or that an additional 48,000 children under the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that the number of people living in extreme poverty may increase by 122 million , or that extreme droughts in the Amazon will accelerate the migration of traditional communities and Indigenous peoples to cities , or that freshwater will be severely limited for some small islands .\nBy 2040 , when my daughter is 24 , the glacier on Africa \u2019 s tallest mountain , Mt .\nKilimanjaro in Tanzania , may be gone .",

Crackhead Barney roamed around in a Trump mask , breasts bared , past a man painted green from head to toe , wearing only a jockstrap and an alligator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOver the sound of a jazz band , the screams were now clearer : \u201c This is being paid for by Peter Thiel !\n\u201d At the center of the pandemonium was a young artist from Miami named Trevor Bazile .\nDressed inconspicuously in a

way of disconnecting the next generation from the power grid of contemporary liberalism .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of disruption .\nBut the allure of such a shift stretches beyond MAGA Republicans .\nThere

self-promotional , media figures who have built lucrative careers banging on about \u201c cancel culture , \u201d and artists and writers of previous generations who find the current cultural constraints intolerable .\n`` Transgressive organizations like the \u2018 New People \u2019 s Cinema Club \u2019 must survive because they help keep devious ideas near and dear to the hearts of the young , '' Waters wrote in an email .\nSelf-aware and supremely ironic creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwoke \u201d set understand that they are useful to the right and even joke about it .\nBazile knew he had been cast for a part in someone else \u2019 s vision of the future .\nBut he accepted the role because he saw in it the chance to pursue his own radical creative agenda \u2014 a dynamic nearly as old as art patronage itself .\nAfter the NPCC , a meme went around that depicted a large puppet , labeled \u201c Trevor Bazile , \u201d holding a smaller puppet , labeled \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding an even smaller puppet , which was labeled \u201c Peter Thiel.\n\u201d The image has a knowingly absurd implication : that an unknown young filmmaker , of all people , could manipulate an oligarch who is known as a right-wing puppet master .\nBut it also contains a more complex truth .\nFor Bazile , who above all was aware of the way he was being used , Peter Thiel \u2019 s money was an opportunity to build a new space in the rubble of American culture .\nIn 2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repertory movie theater in Los Angeles .\nPlaying a mix of strange , forgotten , and contemporary films , the theater quickly turned into \u201c an epicenter of young Hollywood , \u201d according to Variety .\nThen , in August 2017 , a widely distributed anonymous email accused Belove of \u201c sexual harassment , assault , and abuse by former employees and volunteers.\n\u201d Though he denied the allegations , calling them \u201c demonstrable lies and half-truths , \u201d Belove resigned from Cinefamily days after the email was sent .\nOne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belove was a young film editor named Alex Lee Moyer , who had an idea for a documentary .\nThe film would be about a group of driftless young men who gather on 4chan and Twitter to vent their frustration with their lack of romantic and professional prospects .\nBelove was drawn to the subject matter .\nHe felt that these young men had been swept up in an online moral panic ( this one over \u201c incels \u201d ) and that a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary about their lives would make clear how overblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Moyer with the film , TFW NO GF ( imageboard shorthand for \u201c that feeling when no girlfriend.\n\u201d ) Right-wing politics hovered at the edges of the production ; 3D-printed guns advocate Cody Wilson was an early financial supporter .\nBut the documentary itself is affectless , refraining from any judgment of its subjects .\nIn March 2020 , as Belove and Moyer were preparing to screen the film at the South by Southwest festival , they attended a live taping in Los Angeles of Other Life , a podcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe guest was Curtis Yarvin , a prolific blogger and software developer who first achieved notice under the pseudonym \u201c Mencius Moldbug.\n\u201d Writing as Moldbug from 2007 to 2014 , Yarvin became synonymous with \u201c neoreaction , \u201d an abstruse political philosophy that prefers rational authoritarianism to democracy .\nTo the extent that Yarvin is held to be dangerous rather than offensive or kooky , it is because of the sense that he represents an unexpressed current of antidemocratic belief in Silicon Valley .\nBut when Belove listened to Yarvin speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent bong-hit philosopher .\nCurtis Yarvin \u2019 s relationship with Peter Thiel is both well documented and incompletely understood .\nOn the one hand , Yarvin is close enough with Thiel to have watched the 2016 election at the venture capitalist \u2019 s home and to have taken the billionaire \u2019 s investment capital for his startup , Tlon .\n( He also has emailed about politics with Thiel since at least 2013 . )\nOn the other hand , Thiel has invested in a variety of quixotic ventures , including 3D-printed meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be a mug \u2019 s game to try to disentangle Thiel \u2019 s economic interests from his political commitments from his flights of intellectual fancy from the pet projects of his friends .\nStill , to the degree Thiel embodies Silicon Valley \u2019 s contrarianism , cultural insecurity , and nose for a new market , a \u201c postwoke \u201d film company seemed like a natural fit .\nThiel \u2019 s investments in politics have been high profile and consequential , but his ventures in culture and media \u2014 beyond funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been scattershot .\nIn 2018 , BuzzFeed News revealed that Thiel had considered creating a conservative news network ; nothing came of it .\nHe funded the conservative political journal American Affairs , a contrarian science quarterly , and , according to a recent biography , the \u201c heterodox \u201d website Quillette .\nThe Thiel Foundation subsidiary Imitatio , dedicated to the thought of the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard , once purchased a table at a benefit put on by n+1 , a leftist literary magazine .\nIt \u2019 s unclear exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play Nice Ltd. , which Belove registered in California in September 2020 .\n( According to Belove , there are multiple investors , including others from the tech industry . )\nBut at times , Thiel \u2019 s employees have been closely involved in Belove \u2019 s activities .\nIn July 2021 , Belove screened films and partied at the Cannes Film Festival with Jimmy Kaltreider , the executive director of the Thiel Foundation .\nIn texts , Belove referred to members of Thiel Capital as his \u201c traveling companions \u201d and mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaltreider .\nBy this point , Belove had cycled through several ideas for Play Nice .\nIt could be a seed fund , or a production company , or maybe even a streaming service .\nStill , he was at heart a film programmer , and he loved the idea of a festival .\nIn LA , Belove \u2019 s name was toxic .\nBut he knew New York had a thriving young cultural scene , one nostalgic for an authentic city it never knew but half-remembered through the risk-taking films of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially inspired by the notorious , defunct New York Underground Film Festival , Belove reached out in April 2021 to Ed Halter , its former director .\n\u201c I got funding to support a new york underground film fest bringing together the new dirtbag film scene , \u201d Belove wrote in an email .\n\u201c I want to help expand it .\nWe want to be all over town , pop-ups , secret screenings , no website , text invites like rave [ ... ] real underground.\n\u201d Belove didn \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he knew his name would be a distraction .\nSo who could help him find and mentor the young artists he wanted to attract ?\nBelove had been collaborating on Play Nice with Lucas Leyva , the founder of a well-regarded Miami film collective called the Borscht Corporation .\nAnd Leyva said that he knew an extraordinary person who was just right for the job of creative director .\nTrevor Bazile knew what the culture saw when it looked at him : a \u201c royal flush of identities , \u201d as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Black , he was queer , he didn \u2019 t have money , and he was the child of a Haitian immigrant .\nHe was also , according to nearly everyone who encountered him , some kind of genius .\nIn 2017 , Bazile turned up at Borscht to volunteer and never really left .\nStarted in 2005 by Leyva , Borscht had a well-earned reputation for developing the talents of untrained , often first-generation American filmmakers .\nOscar-winning director Barry Jenkins made a short film for Borscht , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d without the collective .\nAs Borscht built its name , it drew investment from major institutional supporters of the arts , including the Knight Foundation , Time Warner , and the Andy Warhol Foundation .\nBy the time Bazile arrived , Borscht was already an established draw for eccentric young artists .\nInspired by the idea of an authentic culture in a city known for its superficial glitz , Borscht fellows were a mix of posh kids with prestigious arts training and local kids from working-class families .\n( The program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s grandson . )\nIt was an exciting , combustible combination .\nBazile stood out immediately .\n\u201c His brain was glow-in-the-dark , special , \u201d Leyva said .\n\u201c He thought differently from anyone else.\n\u201d Bazile made formally inventive , jazz-inflected short films , but also sculptures and installations .\nHe would sleep in the Borscht space , located in an old mall in downtown Miami , and it became a second home .\nHe started to lead a group of fellows who gave themselves the name \u201c Bisque \u201d ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmmakers that \u201c we \u2019 re young , and I think we \u2019 re more talented.\n\u201d In January 2020 , a woman published a blog post ( since removed ) accusing Lucas Leyva of sexual assault .\nLeyva insists that the encounter was consensual , as does a second woman who participated ; he filed a defamation suit , which is ongoing .\nBefore he resigned as president , Leyva lobbied the Borscht board to replace him with Bazile .\nThey turned Leyva \u2019 s request down .\n( It ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its support , and today Borscht is essentially defunct . )\nBazile \u2019 s professional ambitions had been denied .\nWith Borscht crumbling , he had lost the space and the money to make art .\nThen the coronavirus closed down the city .\nFriends who came from money retreated to the safety of their family homes .\nBazile lashed out on social media against people he thought were trying to take down Borscht .\nHe spent more of his time on Instagram , making a name for himself in the obscure reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed communities of posters who make densely ironic memes about topics like anarcho-capitalism and French philosopher Gilles Deleuze .\nDuring the George Floyd protests , as Instagram filled up with black squares and calls for donations to racial justice causes of varying seriousness , Bazile told friends that he was overcome by cynicism .\nWith his \u201c royal flush \u201d of identities , cancel culture should work for him , he said to a friend .\nBut here he was without prospects , all because of Borscht being canceled .\nMeanwhile , wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t care about him or Black people in general , were making symbolic gestures \u2014 chasing clout \u2014 on social media .\nBazile told friends that he was drawn to Afropessimism , a bleak philosophy of race arguing that anti-Black violence is so fundamental to the nature of Western society that the only way to end it would be to end the world as we know it .\nIn a December 2020 appearance on the cult film podcast The Ion Pack , Bazile said that around this time , he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown.\n\u201d But the trip led to a moment of clarity : The culture that had robbed him had its own rules , which he could use to his advantage .\n\u201c If I act like how people on these apps are acting , who are trying to chase social capital by canceling people , I need to participate in this market , \u201d he said on the podcast .\nCancellation was a form of currency , maybe the only one he had .\n\u201c That \u2019 s when I started shitposting \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI haven \u2019 t stopped since then.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to explain what Bazile did on Instagram starting in mid-2020 .\nFirst of all , he kept getting banned , so only one of his accounts , @ all_triggers _no _warnings , is still accessible .\nSecond , he posted things that are so offensive they are tricky to describe .\nHe posted at such a blistering pace and in such contradictory ways that to fasten it down with adjectives feels beside the point .\nBazile posted pro-Trump memes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in blackface , memes mocking anti-fat discourse , a photograph of a Hegel T-shirt , hundreds of bizarre and abject clips he found on TikTok , a drawing of a Black man performing fellatio on a white penis at the summit of a milk crate challenge .\nHe took so many political stances that he seemed to be mocking the idea of having a political stance at all .\nHe gained access to a massively ironic Instagram collective called the Incellectuals , then got booted for being too offensive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cult figure .\n\u201c Ironic Blackness needs to take up digital space , \u201d he said in the Ion Pack interview .\nLeftists were taking back online irony from \u201c alt-right motherfuckers , \u201d he said , and centrists just couldn \u2019 t deal .\nOne of his gimmicks was to respond to offended white commenters with a link to his Cash App , as if to say , If you want me to read your opinion , you have to pay me .\nThese payments kept Bazile afloat for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at an upscale ice cream parlor .\nHe didn \u2019 t have a car ; he begged for rides ; he crashed on couches .\nWhen Leyva asked him whether he wanted to be the creative director of the NPCC , he said yes .\nSome of Bazile \u2019 s friends were unsettled that he was going to work for a festival that was funded by Thiel \u2019 s money and created by a disgraced man plotting a second act .\nIn long arguments over Instagram DMs that summer , Bazile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to make work that conventional patrons would never support .\n\u201c There was a constant fight between what he wanted to say and what a liberal institution would want him to say or make work about , \u201d Pedro Bello , a friend of his , told me .\nHe also made it clear that his relationships with Belove and Thiel were transactional .\nHe knew he was a convenient face for the festival , but he knew NPCC was an opportunity .\nThat was the exchange : Use and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he wanted to do , \u201d said a friend of Bazile \u2019 s , who asked that I identify him by his Instagram handle , @ gaypanique2 .\n\u201c He saw it as a wager .\nThe wager he was making was , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to deal with these unsavory people.\n\u2019 It was very practical .\nHe was not hiding anything .\n\u2018 I \u2019 m poor , I need money , I need money to do art .\nWhat does it matter if it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving it to me ?\nWe \u2019 re going to celebrate and laugh in the face of destruction.\n\u2019 \u201d Bazile arrived in New York in July 2021 , rented an apartment in Brooklyn , and went about trying to organize a film festival .\nHe had to contend with Hadrian Belove \u2019 s reputation .\nCinefamily \u2019 s implosion had left a crater in the independent film scene in LA , and now Belove had shown up on the East Coast , trailed by rumors that he had financial support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his two young co-organizers down , unwilling or afraid to participate in what had become known unofficially as the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d But Bazile had cachet among a new clique of Instagram-obsessed Manhattan scenesters .\nAt a July party at Russian Samovar thrown by The Ion Pack and cohosted by influencer Caroline Calloway , Leyva watched , amused , as a crowd of people formed around his old fellow , hoping to meet Trevor \u201c Memes \u201d Bazile .\n( A Grub Street party report described the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , very online people.\n\u201d ) It was the exact scene Belove had hoped to leverage .\nBazile and his co-organizers slowly put together a lineup of 23 films .\nIt included screenings of a debut by a high school teacher , an Austrian movie about an android , two older works involving literary men in various stages of post-cancellation cultural limbo , and the debut of a short film by Kids director Larry Clark .\nAlex Lee Moyer screened a cut of her follow-up to TFW NO GF , a strenuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUp until the last minute , the NPCC suffered cancellations \u2014 real ones .\nClark fell out for medical reasons , then The Ion Pack hosts , who were set to interview the filmmaker , withdrew .\nThen noise band Wolf Eyes dropped out .\nThe Ace Hotel was originally supposed to host Bazile \u2019 s big party but backed out after staffers were alarmed by offensive jokes on the NPCC \u2019 s Twitter account , which Bazile ran .\n\u201c The central themes of our festival are around transgression and deplatformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to an Ace spokesperson .\n\u201c In contemporary liberal art spaces , especially those that exist online , whenever an artist engages themes of transgression or subversion they are assumed to be right wing , or white supremacist , regardless of the intent or content of their work.\n\u201d Then , only a week before the festival was set to begin , a Brooklyn synagogue informed the organizers that it would no longer host Red Scare and John Waters because anonymous callers had claimed the festival was antisemitic .\nThe best-known filmmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was Caveh Zahedi , whose documentaries the New York Times called in a 2019 profile \u201c abject , self-defeating , ethically questionable , and maddeningly original.\n\u201d Friends and colleagues at the New School tried to talk him out of doing the festival because of the Thiel money , a request he found hypocritical given the compromised nature of film funding in general .\n\u201c A lot of the grants people get come from horrible abuses that generate tons of profit that make philanthropy possible in the first place , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s most loved films , The Sheik and I , was originally commissioned for the 2011 Sharjah Biennial on the theme of \u201c art as a subversive act.\n\u201d The film Zahedi ended up making so ruthlessly satirized the United Arab Emirates that it was banned , and the director himself was threatened with arrest .\nIn Zahedi \u2019 s world , it doesn \u2019 t make sense for an artist to reject bad money , because the system that gives the money value is itself bad ; rather , the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a statement .\nBut what kind of statement did Bazile want to make ?\nA dedicated observer of the strange and shifting politics of the internet might squint and see in his NPCC something like a coming-out party for the \u201c Post Left , \u201d a strange and shifting term .\nDerided by journalist Carl Beijer as \u201c an internet clique waiting on a check , \u201d the \u201c Post Left \u201d sometimes refers to a group of online media figures who reject the American left as insufficiently radical and align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore importantly , it describes a chaotic internet subculture that is closely associated with the depressive outlook of Gen Z \u2014 the milieu in which Bazile had become a minor star .\nBetter thought of as an attitude than a coherent politics , this \u201c Post Left \u201d associates identity politics with self-righteous millennials and confused boomers .\nSo too does it reject electoral politics , which it sees as fatally compromised by capitalism and preposterously insufficient to the task of addressing the climate crisis .\nGleefully ironic , this sensibility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the sympathetic position that the most appropriate response to the end of the world might be to laugh and play .\nEspecially if Peter Thiel is paying .\nSeveral months after the festival , Nile Harris , Bazile \u2019 s collaborator , posted to Instagram a picture of the pair on the Eldridge Street roof , standing inside a deflated blow-up castle in front of a painted white brick wall .\nIn the photograph , they both stare into the camera .\n\u201c Peter Thiel bought me a house , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a home.\n\u201d \u201c It felt like , look at what we can do with his money , \u201d one attendee said .\n\u201c Look at what we \u2019 re doing with your money , you dick.\n\u201d Generations of artists have defined themselves by rebelling against the values of the bourgeoisie .\nBut a subculture based on transgressing bourgeois norms in 2021 faces a trap : It can look indistinguishable from Trumpism .\nThe distinction between shocking liberals as an aesthetic goal and a political one starts to blur .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world an original cultural sensibility , but it also gave the world Gavin McInnes , the founder of the Proud Boys .\nWhile working on her documentary about Alex Jones , Moyer attended the Jan. 6 \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally ; that day , she posted to Instagram a photograph in the hotel room of pro-Trump indie musician Ariel Pink , who did the soundtrack for TFW NO GF and had attended the rally in support of the former President .\nThe attempt to re-create a scuzzy hipster nihilism \u2014 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most notorious financier \u2014 feels to some like the farce arriving before the tragedy has even ended .\nThat \u2019 s why Ed Halter , the old New York Underground Film Festival organizer , never responded to Hadrian Belove \u2019 s email .\n\u201c I have a Gen X embarrassment about this myself , \u201d said Halter , who is now a critic in residence at Bard College .\n\u201c I understand why they reached out to me .\nFor that very reason I did not want to be any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2019 90s was anti-political , whereas now it \u2019 s being harnessed to a cynical right-wing politics .\nAnd I feel old enough now to see the trick.\n\u201d What makes the new transgressive culture more complicated is it sees the trick as well \u2014 and folds it into the joke .\nIndeed , \u201c Thiel as fascist paymaster \u201d is now such a media trope that it has become a kind of meme in the Post Left , with associated microcelebrities joking about `` needing Thiel money '' or being Venmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d as Post Left internet communities sometimes call them , are , in this sense , less important as a source of income than as a shock tactic ; claiming them , ironically or otherwise , confers its own bizarro credibility .\nIn the days leading up to the NPCC festival , Bazile had confided in Gaypanique that he feared there was no organic reason for it to exist beyond Thiel \u2019 s money and Belove \u2019 s ego .\nSo when Gaypanique saw Bazile on the last day of the festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off something on his own terms .\nBut Bazile scoffed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I have the capacity to do this anymore , \u201d he said , cryptically , about the festival .\n\u201c I need you to rip it to shreds.\n\u201d That night , a Philadelphia bartender named Victor Kane , who owns a popular meme account on Instagram called @ chethanxfinsta , arrived in Brooklyn to find Bazile distraught .\nEarly the next morning , Kane posted an Instagram story .\nOn top of a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the night at Bazile \u2019 s apartment : \u201c When I got there he looked like he had way too much to drink [ ... ] We went out and grabbed a couple drinks and returned to the Airbnb to chill and fall asleepv .\nI told him that I was worried bc he was covered in sweat and was wheezing [ ... ] he told me he was just tired and fat and the wheezing was normal .\nStill I crashed on the floor next to him to make sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 mins and when I woke up he was no longer breathing .\nI immediately called 911 and they spent over an hour trying to bring him back however they were not successful .\nIt is with the heaviest heart I have to inform everyone that Trevor passed away at 307am last night and is no longer with us.\n\u201d Then he posted a picture of Bazile , underneath a rippling digital banner .\nIt read , \u201c Rest in Power.\n\u201d When Bazile \u2019 s friends first saw the posts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke .\nEven in the irony-saturated world he inhabited , who would announce a death that way ?\nBut it was true .\nBazile was dead .\nHe was only 25 .\nAccording to Trenny Hardy , Bazile \u2019 s mother , the New York City death certificate lists the cause as \u201c pending further study.\n\u201d On Oct. 29 , the NPCC Instagram made an announcement .\n\u201c He cared deeply about art , and the need for a kind of creative freedom and openness that could be wildly transgressive , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of NPC fest , he said it was because that \u2019 s what culture was turning everyone into\u2014people without independent thought\u2014and that by naming the fest NPC , we could reclaim this concept and cast a sort of spell to free everyone from it.\n\u201d \u201c NPC \u201d is an initialism from computer role-playing games , short for \u201c nonplayer character.\n\u201d It refers to a digital avatar that is controlled by the computer rather than by the player , a digital life running on a little loop .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of American culture in the 2020s : repetitive , preprogrammed , dull .\nBut blaming liberal politics for that repetition ignores deeper cultural tracks laid down over the past two decades by a handful of companies in Silicon Valley , owned and operated by a tiny group of billionaires .\nAny protest of that system from within can be copied , commodified , and turned into its own kind of script .\nSince Trevor Bazile \u2019 s death , there \u2019 s been sniping on Twitter about higher-profile , white posters stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking credit .\nAnd so much of his work has been scrubbed from the internet by Instagram that it \u2019 s hard to say what , exactly , Bazile left behind .\nFor an artist obsessed with taking up new kinds of space , he has in some ways already disappeared .\nHad Bazile lived , friends think he might have redefined indie film in New York or turned into a Virgil Abloh figure .\nIn five years , they say , we \u2019 ll catch up to what he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen , \u201d said Pedro Bello , the friend from Miami .\n\u201c He was still trapped pleasing people to reach his goals .\nHis sentence is not complete.\n\u201d In the end , the attempt to re-create in miniature the druggy , anything-goes downtown Manhattan of the 1990s ended with a brilliant young person dying .\nYou could call it ironic , if you wanted to .\nA deeper irony is that beneath the NPCC \u2019 s rhetoric of transgression lay a perfectly neat series of exchanges : money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity for clout , and so on .\nIndeed , Peter Thiel \u2019 s real influence over the \u201c postwoke , \u201d or the \u201c Post Left , \u201d or whatever this sensibility comes to be called , might be thought of in a different way .\nThe subculture has the same logic as the tech oligarchy that Thiel embodies .\nIt follows the same rules \u2014 imitate , iterate , transact .\nAt the screening of the Alex Jones documentary , the audience had to sign nondisclosure agreements : legal documents ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival .\nIt was all very Silicon Valley .\n\u25cf",

prefecture , entire villages were inundated by torrential downpours in Western Germany , and a wildfire destroyed Canada \u2019 s town of Lytton .\nSome of these disasters pose real risks of physical harm to kids .\nTake extreme heat and heat waves : Pregnant people , babies , and young kids are all more vulnerable to heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies aren \u2019 t as good at cooling and staying that way .\nStudies even show that an unborn child \u2019 s exposure to extreme heat while in the womb could result in negative health outcomes later , such as lower birth weight .\nFor older kids , as the number of hot days increases with global warming , they risk greater exposure to the heat in schools without air conditioning and during outdoor activities , like sports .\nThis latest IPCC assessment also discusses how disasters , both the acute exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one , can damage the mental health and well-being of everyone impacted , especially kids .\nAfter major flooding occurred in the United Kingdom in 2000 , for instance , researchers tracked the health of people whose homes flooded and did not flood , according to Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington , who helped co-write the report \u2019 s chapter on health .\n\u201c There was a very clear difference in probable anxiety , depression , and post-traumatic stress disorder \u201d between the different groups , she explained .\nHeadline-spurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more intense , are perhaps the most obvious signs of how 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming , compared to pre-industrial times , is playing out .\nBut there are far more climate impacts already here , as the new report exhaustively details .\nEven before my daughter was born , for example , two species went extinct and climate change played a role : the Golden toad in Costa Rica in 1990 , as well as Australia \u2019 s Bramble Cay melomys , a type of rodent , in 2016 .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction : Australia \u2019 s lemuroid ringtail possum .\nAnd there have been far more local extinctions : Climate-linked local extinctions were detected in 47 % of 976 animal and plant species examined .\nThe impact of climate change on top of existing problems of food availability and high prices can be a \u201c lethal combination for kids , \u201d said Rachel Bezner Kerr of Cornell University , a coauthor on the IPCC chapter on food systems , \u201c especially in low-income countries , especially low-income households , especially in rural areas.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed between 1993 and 2012 , increased temperatures was significantly related to children \u2019 s wasting in 30 countries in Africa , \u201d she added .\nWasting refers to a child that is too thin for their height , according to the World Health Organization .\nMalnutrition is already a huge problem in kids in certain developing nations , and that problem will only get bigger in a warmer world if action isn \u2019 t specifically taken to avoid that possibility .\nHow Hot Will It Get In My Daughter \u2019 s Lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate agreement in 2016 , they agreed to jointly limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius ( about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) , ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius .\nNow scientists predict that it is \u201c more likely than not \u201d that global average temperatures will pass 1.5 degrees in the coming decades , no matter what .\nIt could happen by 2030 , when my daughter is only 12 years old .\nThat \u2019 s why the next few years matter so much .\nHow quickly people cut their greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the 1.5-degree threshold is exceeded and what happens next .\nWill temperatures keep going up or will they start to come back down ?\nMoreover , what people do now to start adapting to the warming that \u2019 s already here and locked in for the future will minimize the damage associated with the crisis .\nBy 2030 , for example , it \u2019 s possible that countries will embrace the bold goal of protecting at least 30 % of the planet \u2019 s land and water .\nIf so , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some species alive to bolstering natural ecosystems that protect against floods , help suck up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere , and do much more .\nAnd if China transitioned to a half-decarbonized power supply for homes and vehicles by 2030 , per the report , the country could expect to prevent 55,000-69,000 deaths in that year .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that urban areas may see their exposure to flooding go up 2.7 times by 2030 compared to 2000 , or that an additional 48,000 children under the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that the number of people living in extreme poverty may increase by 122 million , or that extreme droughts in the Amazon will accelerate the migration of traditional communities and Indigenous peoples to cities , or that freshwater will be severely limited for some small islands .\nBy 2040 , when my daughter is 24 , the glacier on Africa \u2019 s tallest mountain , Mt .\nKilimanjaro in Tanzania , may be gone .",

beams of the $ 7.5 million carriage house , a DJ played techno for a young and queer crowd .\nAmid throngs of twentysomethings who were pierced and shorn in unusual places , a performance artist named Crackhead Barney roamed around in a Trump mask , breasts bared , past a man painted green from head to toe , wearing only a jockstrap and an alligator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOver the sound of a jazz band , the screams were now clearer : \u201c This is being paid for by Peter Thiel !\n\u201d At the center of the pandemonium was a young artist from Miami named Trevor Bazile .\nDressed inconspicuously in a baggy hoodie and jeans , he raced from conversation to conversation , stopping along the way to pluck at a stand-up bass and then to bounce around an art installation set inside a children \u2019 s blow-up castle .\nA chaotic mix of short films , live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dance parties , NPCC brought together respected independent filmmakers , hard-right software developers , leftist DJs , and queer performance artists .\nIt built buzz through a new downtown media scene that revolves around a handful of interlocking podcasts with provocative politics .\n( The hosts of Red Scare , the most popular of those shows , interviewed legendary cult filmmaker John Waters on NPCC \u2019 s first night . )\nThe fest \u2019 s aesthetic was one of deliberate bad taste \u2014 official T-shirts depicted the Statue of Liberty dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Worst Is Yet to Come.\n\u201d But in 2022 , bad taste carries a political charge .\nThe NPCC acquired a derisive nickname during its planning : the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d In part , that \u2019 s because rumors of right-wing funding swirled around the festival in the months leading up to it .\nBut the label reflects something trickier to define , a broader sense that there is a core of young artists and trendsetters in New York and Los Angeles who , post-Trump , are rediscovering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you must , a vibe shift : a new generation of internet-native tastemakers \u2014 like many of the people crowded into Bazile \u2019 s party \u2014 who find the moralistic gatekeeping of millennials all a bit pass\u00e9 .\nA youthful subculture that rejects liberal pieties naturally excites the American right .\nIt \u2019 s a sign of the pendulum swinging , a chance to break the culture war stalemate of the Trump years .\nThiel , who did not comment for this story , has called identity politics an \u201c insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that weakens the United States .\nAn investment in a culture of cool that declares \u201c wokeness \u201d unfashionable , like an investment in politicians who attack the teaching of critical race theory in schools or an investment that steers kids away from college , is a way of disconnecting the next generation from the power grid of contemporary liberalism .\nIt \u2019 s a kind of disruption .\nBut the allure of such a shift stretches beyond MAGA Republicans .\nThere \u2019 s a diverse coalition of Americans who resent the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled liberals who think aspects of # MeToo and the racial justice movement are excessive or cynically self-promotional , media figures who have built lucrative careers banging on about \u201c cancel culture , \u201d and artists and writers of previous generations who find the current cultural constraints intolerable .\n`` Transgressive organizations like the \u2018 New People \u2019 s Cinema Club \u2019 must survive because they help keep devious ideas near and dear to the hearts of the young , '' Waters wrote in an email .\nSelf-aware and supremely ironic creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwoke \u201d set understand that they are useful to the right and even joke about it .\nBazile knew he had been cast for a part in someone else \u2019 s vision of the future .\nBut he accepted the role because he saw in it the chance to pursue his own radical creative agenda \u2014 a dynamic nearly as old as art patronage itself .\nAfter the NPCC , a meme went around that depicted a large puppet , labeled \u201c Trevor Bazile , \u201d holding a smaller puppet , labeled \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding an even smaller puppet , which was labeled \u201c Peter Thiel.\n\u201d The image has a knowingly absurd implication : that an unknown young filmmaker , of all people , could manipulate an oligarch who is known as a right-wing puppet master .\nBut it also contains a more complex truth .\nFor Bazile , who above all was aware of the way he was being used , Peter Thiel \u2019 s money was an opportunity to build a new space in the rubble of American culture .\nIn 2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repertory movie theater in Los Angeles .\nPlaying a mix of strange , forgotten , and contemporary films , the theater quickly turned into \u201c an epicenter of young Hollywood , \u201d according to Variety .\nThen , in August 2017 , a widely distributed anonymous email accused Belove of \u201c sexual harassment , assault , and abuse by former employees and volunteers.\n\u201d Though he denied the allegations , calling them \u201c demonstrable lies and half-truths , \u201d Belove resigned from Cinefamily days after the email was sent .\nOne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belove was a young film editor named Alex Lee Moyer , who had an idea for a documentary .\nThe film would be about a group of driftless young men who gather on 4chan and Twitter to vent their frustration with their lack of romantic and professional prospects .\nBelove was drawn to the subject matter .\nHe felt that these young men had been swept up in an online moral panic ( this one over \u201c incels \u201d ) and that a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 documentary about their lives would make clear how overblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Moyer with the film , TFW NO GF ( imageboard shorthand for \u201c that feeling when no girlfriend.\n\u201d ) Right-wing politics hovered at the edges of the production ; 3D-printed guns advocate Cody Wilson was an early financial supporter .\nBut the documentary itself is affectless , refraining from any judgment of its subjects .\nIn March 2020 , as Belove and Moyer were preparing to screen the film at the South by Southwest festival , they attended a live taping in Los Angeles of Other Life , a podcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe guest was Curtis Yarvin , a prolific blogger and software developer who first achieved notice under the pseudonym \u201c Mencius Moldbug.\n\u201d Writing as Moldbug from 2007 to 2014 , Yarvin became synonymous with \u201c neoreaction , \u201d an abstruse political philosophy that prefers rational authoritarianism to democracy .\nTo the extent that Yarvin is held to be dangerous rather than offensive or kooky , it is because of the sense that he represents an unexpressed current of antidemocratic belief in Silicon Valley .\nBut when Belove listened to Yarvin speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent bong-hit philosopher .\nCurtis Yarvin \u2019 s relationship with Peter Thiel is both well documented and incompletely understood .\nOn the one hand , Yarvin is close enough with Thiel to have watched the 2016 election at the venture capitalist \u2019 s home and to have taken the billionaire \u2019 s investment capital for his startup , Tlon .\n( He also has emailed about politics with Thiel since at least 2013 . )\nOn the other hand , Thiel has invested in a variety of quixotic ventures , including 3D-printed meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be a mug \u2019 s game to try to disentangle Thiel \u2019 s economic interests from his political commitments from his flights of intellectual fancy from the pet projects of his friends .\nStill , to the degree Thiel embodies Silicon Valley \u2019 s contrarianism , cultural insecurity , and nose for a new market , a \u201c postwoke \u201d film company seemed like a natural fit .\nThiel \u2019 s investments in politics have been high profile and consequential , but his ventures in culture and media \u2014 beyond funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been scattershot .\nIn 2018 , BuzzFeed News revealed that Thiel had considered creating a conservative news network ; nothing came of it .\nHe funded the conservative political journal American Affairs , a contrarian science quarterly , and , according to a recent biography , the \u201c heterodox \u201d website Quillette .\nThe Thiel Foundation subsidiary Imitatio , dedicated to the thought of the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard , once purchased a table at a benefit put on by n+1 , a leftist literary magazine .\nIt \u2019 s unclear exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play Nice Ltd. , which Belove registered in California in September 2020 .\n( According to Belove , there are multiple investors , including others from the tech industry . )\nBut at times , Thiel \u2019 s employees have been closely involved in Belove \u2019 s activities .\nIn July 2021 , Belove screened films and partied at the Cannes Film Festival with Jimmy Kaltreider , the executive director of the Thiel Foundation .\nIn texts , Belove referred to members of Thiel Capital as his \u201c traveling companions \u201d and mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaltreider .\nBy this point , Belove had cycled through several ideas for Play Nice .\nIt could be a seed fund , or a production company , or maybe even a streaming service .\nStill , he was at heart a film programmer , and he loved the idea of a festival .\nIn LA , Belove \u2019 s name was toxic .\nBut he knew New York had a thriving young cultural scene , one nostalgic for an authentic city it never knew but half-remembered through the risk-taking films of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partially inspired by the notorious , defunct New York Underground Film Festival , Belove reached out in April 2021 to Ed Halter , its former director .\n\u201c I got funding to support a new york underground film fest bringing together the new dirtbag film scene , \u201d Belove wrote in an email .\n\u201c I want to help expand it .\nWe want to be all over town , pop-ups , secret screenings , no website , text invites like rave [ ... ] real underground.\n\u201d Belove didn \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he knew his name would be a distraction .\nSo who could help him find and mentor the young artists he wanted to attract ?\nBelove had been collaborating on Play Nice with Lucas Leyva , the founder of a well-regarded Miami film collective called the Borscht Corporation .\nAnd Leyva said that he knew an extraordinary person who was just right for the job of creative director .\nTrevor Bazile knew what the culture saw when it looked at him : a \u201c royal flush of identities , \u201d as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Black , he was queer , he didn \u2019 t have money , and he was the child of a Haitian immigrant .\nHe was also , according to nearly everyone who encountered him , some kind of genius .\nIn 2017 , Bazile turned up at Borscht to volunteer and never really left .\nStarted in 2005 by Leyva , Borscht had a well-earned reputation for developing the talents of untrained , often first-generation American filmmakers .\nOscar-winning director Barry Jenkins made a short film for Borscht , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d without the collective .\nAs Borscht built its name , it drew investment from major institutional supporters of the arts , including the Knight Foundation , Time Warner , and the Andy Warhol Foundation .\nBy the time Bazile arrived , Borscht was already an established draw for eccentric young artists .\nInspired by the idea of an authentic culture in a city known for its superficial glitz , Borscht fellows were a mix of posh kids with prestigious arts training and local kids from working-class families .\n( The program was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s grandson . )\nIt was an exciting , combustible combination .\nBazile stood out immediately .\n\u201c His brain was glow-in-the-dark , special , \u201d Leyva said .\n\u201c He thought differently from anyone else.\n\u201d Bazile made formally inventive , jazz-inflected short films , but also sculptures and installations .\nHe would sleep in the Borscht space , located in an old mall in downtown Miami , and it became a second home .\nHe started to lead a group of fellows who gave themselves the name \u201c Bisque \u201d ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmmakers that \u201c we \u2019 re young , and I think we \u2019 re more talented.\n\u201d In January 2020 , a woman published a blog post ( since removed ) accusing Lucas Leyva of sexual assault .\nLeyva insists that the encounter was consensual , as does a second woman who participated ; he filed a defamation suit , which is ongoing .\nBefore he resigned as president , Leyva lobbied the Borscht board to replace him with Bazile .\nThey turned Leyva \u2019 s request down .\n( It ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its support , and today Borscht is essentially defunct . )\nBazile \u2019 s professional ambitions had been denied .\nWith Borscht crumbling , he had lost the space and the money to make art .\nThen the coronavirus closed down the city .\nFriends who came from money retreated to the safety of their family homes .\nBazile lashed out on social media against people he thought were trying to take down Borscht .\nHe spent more of his time on Instagram , making a name for himself in the obscure reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed communities of posters who make densely ironic memes about topics like anarcho-capitalism and French philosopher Gilles Deleuze .\nDuring the George Floyd protests , as Instagram filled up with black squares and calls for donations to racial justice causes of varying seriousness , Bazile told friends that he was overcome by cynicism .\nWith his \u201c royal flush \u201d of identities , cancel culture should work for him , he said to a friend .\nBut here he was without prospects , all because of Borscht being canceled .\nMeanwhile , wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t care about him or Black people in general , were making symbolic gestures \u2014 chasing clout \u2014 on social media .\nBazile told friends that he was drawn to Afropessimism , a bleak philosophy of race arguing that anti-Black violence is so fundamental to the nature of Western society that the only way to end it would be to end the world as we know it .\nIn a December 2020 appearance on the cult film podcast The Ion Pack , Bazile said that around this time , he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown.\n\u201d But the trip led to a moment of clarity : The culture that had robbed him had its own rules , which he could use to his advantage .\n\u201c If I act like how people on these apps are acting , who are trying to chase social capital by canceling people , I need to participate in this market , \u201d he said on the podcast .\nCancellation was a form of currency , maybe the only one he had .\n\u201c That \u2019 s when I started shitposting \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI haven \u2019 t stopped since then.\n\u201d It \u2019 s hard to explain what Bazile did on Instagram starting in mid-2020 .\nFirst of all , he kept getting banned , so only one of his accounts , @ all_triggers _no _warnings , is still accessible .\nSecond , he posted things that are so offensive they are tricky to describe .\nHe posted at such a blistering pace and in such contradictory ways that to fasten it down with adjectives feels beside the point .\nBazile posted pro-Trump memes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in blackface , memes mocking anti-fat discourse , a photograph of a Hegel T-shirt , hundreds of bizarre and abject clips he found on TikTok , a drawing of a Black man performing fellatio on a white penis at the summit of a milk crate challenge .\nHe took so many political stances that he seemed to be mocking the idea of having a political stance at all .\nHe gained access to a massively ironic Instagram collective called the Incellectuals , then got booted for being too offensive .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cult figure .\n\u201c Ironic Blackness needs to take up digital space , \u201d he said in the Ion Pack interview .\nLeftists were taking back online irony from \u201c alt-right motherfuckers , \u201d he said , and centrists just couldn \u2019 t deal .\nOne of his gimmicks was to respond to offended white commenters with a link to his Cash App , as if to say , If you want me to read your opinion , you have to pay me .\nThese payments kept Bazile afloat for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at an upscale ice cream parlor .\nHe didn \u2019 t have a car ; he begged for rides ; he crashed on couches .\nWhen Leyva asked him whether he wanted to be the creative director of the NPCC , he said yes .\nSome of Bazile \u2019 s friends were unsettled that he was going to work for a festival that was funded by Thiel \u2019 s money and created by a disgraced man plotting a second act .\nIn long arguments over Instagram DMs that summer , Bazile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to make work that conventional patrons would never support .\n\u201c There was a constant fight between what he wanted to say and what a liberal institution would want him to say or make work about , \u201d Pedro Bello , a friend of his , told me .\nHe also made it clear that his relationships with Belove and Thiel were transactional .\nHe knew he was a convenient face for the festival , but he knew NPCC was an opportunity .\nThat was the exchange : Use and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he wanted to do , \u201d said a friend of Bazile \u2019 s , who asked that I identify him by his Instagram handle , @ gaypanique2 .\n\u201c He saw it as a wager .\nThe wager he was making was , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to deal with these unsavory people.\n\u2019 It was very practical .\nHe was not hiding anything .\n\u2018 I \u2019 m poor , I need money , I need money to do art .\nWhat does it matter if it \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving it to me ?\nWe \u2019 re going to celebrate and laugh in the face of destruction.\n\u2019 \u201d Bazile arrived in New York in July 2021 , rented an apartment in Brooklyn , and went about trying to organize a film festival .\nHe had to contend with Hadrian Belove \u2019 s reputation .\nCinefamily \u2019 s implosion had left a crater in the independent film scene in LA , and now Belove had shown up on the East Coast , trailed by rumors that he had financial support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his two young co-organizers down , unwilling or afraid to participate in what had become known unofficially as the \u201c anti-woke film festival.\n\u201d But Bazile had cachet among a new clique of Instagram-obsessed Manhattan scenesters .\nAt a July party at Russian Samovar thrown by The Ion Pack and cohosted by influencer Caroline Calloway , Leyva watched , amused , as a crowd of people formed around his old fellow , hoping to meet Trevor \u201c Memes \u201d Bazile .\n( A Grub Street party report described the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , very online people.\n\u201d ) It was the exact scene Belove had hoped to leverage .\nBazile and his co-organizers slowly put together a lineup of 23 films .\nIt included screenings of a debut by a high school teacher , an Austrian movie about an android , two older works involving literary men in various stages of post-cancellation cultural limbo , and the debut of a short film by Kids director Larry Clark .\nAlex Lee Moyer screened a cut of her follow-up to TFW NO GF , a strenuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nUp until the last minute , the NPCC suffered cancellations \u2014 real ones .\nClark fell out for medical reasons , then The Ion Pack hosts , who were set to interview the filmmaker , withdrew .\nThen noise band Wolf Eyes dropped out .\nThe Ace Hotel was originally supposed to host Bazile \u2019 s big party but backed out after staffers were alarmed by offensive jokes on the NPCC \u2019 s Twitter account , which Bazile ran .\n\u201c The central themes of our festival are around transgression and deplatformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email to an Ace spokesperson .\n\u201c In contemporary liberal art spaces , especially those that exist online , whenever an artist engages themes of transgression or subversion they are assumed to be right wing , or white supremacist , regardless of the intent or content of their work.\n\u201d Then , only a week before the festival was set to begin , a Brooklyn synagogue informed the organizers that it would no longer host Red Scare and John Waters because anonymous callers had claimed the festival was antisemitic .\nThe best-known filmmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was Caveh Zahedi , whose documentaries the New York Times called in a 2019 profile \u201c abject , self-defeating , ethically questionable , and maddeningly original.\n\u201d Friends and colleagues at the New School tried to talk him out of doing the festival because of the Thiel money , a request he found hypocritical given the compromised nature of film funding in general .\n\u201c A lot of the grants people get come from horrible abuses that generate tons of profit that make philanthropy possible in the first place , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s most loved films , The Sheik and I , was originally commissioned for the 2011 Sharjah Biennial on the theme of \u201c art as a subversive act.\n\u201d The film Zahedi ended up making so ruthlessly satirized the United Arab Emirates that it was banned , and the director himself was threatened with arrest .\nIn Zahedi \u2019 s world , it doesn \u2019 t make sense for an artist to reject bad money , because the system that gives the money value is itself bad ; rather , the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a statement .\nBut what kind of statement did Bazile want to make ?\nA dedicated observer of the strange and shifting politics of the internet might squint and see in his NPCC something like a coming-out party for the \u201c Post Left , \u201d a strange and shifting term .\nDerided by journalist Carl Beijer as \u201c an internet clique waiting on a check , \u201d the \u201c Post Left \u201d sometimes refers to a group of online media figures who reject the American left as insufficiently radical and align @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMore importantly , it describes a chaotic internet subculture that is closely associated with the depressive outlook of Gen Z \u2014 the milieu in which Bazile had become a minor star .\nBetter thought of as an attitude than a coherent politics , this \u201c Post Left \u201d associates identity politics with self-righteous millennials and confused boomers .\nSo too does it reject electoral politics , which it sees as fatally compromised by capitalism and preposterously insufficient to the task of addressing the climate crisis .\nGleefully ironic , this sensibility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the sympathetic position that the most appropriate response to the end of the world might be to laugh and play .\nEspecially if Peter Thiel is paying .\nSeveral months after the festival , Nile Harris , Bazile \u2019 s collaborator , posted to Instagram a picture of the pair on the Eldridge Street roof , standing inside a deflated blow-up castle in front of a painted white brick wall .\nIn the photograph , they both stare into the camera .\n\u201c Peter Thiel bought me a house , \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a home.\n\u201d \u201c It felt like , look at what we can do with his money , \u201d one attendee said .\n\u201c Look at what we \u2019 re doing with your money , you dick.\n\u201d Generations of artists have defined themselves by rebelling against the values of the bourgeoisie .\nBut a subculture based on transgressing bourgeois norms in 2021 faces a trap : It can look indistinguishable from Trumpism .\nThe distinction between shocking liberals as an aesthetic goal and a political one starts to blur .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ world an original cultural sensibility , but it also gave the world Gavin McInnes , the founder of the Proud Boys .\nWhile working on her documentary about Alex Jones , Moyer attended the Jan. 6 \u201c Stop the Steal \u201d rally ; that day , she posted to Instagram a photograph in the hotel room of pro-Trump indie musician Ariel Pink , who did the soundtrack for TFW NO GF and had attended the rally in support of the former President .\nThe attempt to re-create a scuzzy hipster nihilism \u2014 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most notorious financier \u2014 feels to some like the farce arriving before the tragedy has even ended .\nThat \u2019 s why Ed Halter , the old New York Underground Film Festival organizer , never responded to Hadrian Belove \u2019 s email .\n\u201c I have a Gen X embarrassment about this myself , \u201d said Halter , who is now a critic in residence at Bard College .\n\u201c I understand why they reached out to me .\nFor that very reason I did not want to be any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2019 90s was anti-political , whereas now it \u2019 s being harnessed to a cynical right-wing politics .\nAnd I feel old enough now to see the trick.\n\u201d What makes the new transgressive culture more complicated is it sees the trick as well \u2014 and folds it into the joke .\nIndeed , \u201c Thiel as fascist paymaster \u201d is now such a media trope that it has become a kind of meme in the Post Left , with associated microcelebrities joking about `` needing Thiel money '' or being Venmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d as Post Left internet communities sometimes call them , are , in this sense , less important as a source of income than as a shock tactic ; claiming them , ironically or otherwise , confers its own bizarro credibility .\nIn the days leading up to the NPCC festival , Bazile had confided in Gaypanique that he feared there was no organic reason for it to exist beyond Thiel \u2019 s money and Belove \u2019 s ego .\nSo when Gaypanique saw Bazile on the last day of the festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled off something on his own terms .\nBut Bazile scoffed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I have the capacity to do this anymore , \u201d he said , cryptically , about the festival .\n\u201c I need you to rip it to shreds.\n\u201d That night , a Philadelphia bartender named Victor Kane , who owns a popular meme account on Instagram called @ chethanxfinsta , arrived in Brooklyn to find Bazile distraught .\nEarly the next morning , Kane posted an Instagram story .\nOn top of a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the night at Bazile \u2019 s apartment : \u201c When I got there he looked like he had way too much to drink [ ... ] We went out and grabbed a couple drinks and returned to the Airbnb to chill and fall asleepv .\nI told him that I was worried bc he was covered in sweat and was wheezing [ ... ] he told me he was just tired and fat and the wheezing was normal .\nStill I crashed on the floor next to him to make sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 mins and when I woke up he was no longer breathing .\nI immediately called 911 and they spent over an hour trying to bring him back however they were not successful .\nIt is with the heaviest heart I have to inform everyone that Trevor passed away at 307am last night and is no longer with us.\n\u201d Then he posted a picture of Bazile , underneath a rippling digital banner .\nIt read , \u201c Rest in Power.\n\u201d When Bazile \u2019 s friends first saw the posts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke .\nEven in the irony-saturated world he inhabited , who would announce a death that way ?\nBut it was true .\nBazile was dead .\nHe was only 25 .\nAccording to Trenny Hardy , Bazile \u2019 s mother , the New York City death certificate lists the cause as \u201c pending further study.\n\u201d On Oct. 29 , the NPCC Instagram made an announcement .\n\u201c He cared deeply about art , and the need for a kind of creative freedom and openness that could be wildly transgressive , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of NPC fest , he said it was because that \u2019 s what culture was turning everyone into\u2014people without independent thought\u2014and that by naming the fest NPC , we could reclaim this concept and cast a sort of spell to free everyone from it.\n\u201d \u201c NPC \u201d is an initialism from computer role-playing games , short for \u201c nonplayer character.\n\u201d It refers to a digital avatar that is controlled by the computer rather than by the player , a digital life running on a little loop .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of American culture in the 2020s : repetitive , preprogrammed , dull .\nBut blaming liberal politics for that repetition ignores deeper cultural tracks laid down over the past two decades by a handful of companies in Silicon Valley , owned and operated by a tiny group of billionaires .\nAny protest of that system from within can be copied , commodified , and turned into its own kind of script .\nSince Trevor Bazile \u2019 s death , there \u2019 s been sniping on Twitter about higher-profile , white posters stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking credit .\nAnd so much of his work has been scrubbed from the internet by Instagram that it \u2019 s hard to say what , exactly , Bazile left behind .\nFor an artist obsessed with taking up new kinds of space , he has in some ways already disappeared .\nHad Bazile lived , friends think he might have redefined indie film in New York or turned into a Virgil Abloh figure .\nIn five years , they say , we \u2019 ll catch up to what he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen , \u201d said Pedro Bello , the friend from Miami .\n\u201c He was still trapped pleasing people to reach his goals .\nHis sentence is not complete.\n\u201d In the end , the attempt to re-create in miniature the druggy , anything-goes downtown Manhattan of the 1990s ended with a brilliant young person dying .\nYou could call it ironic , if you wanted to .\nA deeper irony is that beneath the NPCC \u2019 s rhetoric of transgression lay a perfectly neat series of exchanges : money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity for clout , and so on .\nIndeed , Peter Thiel \u2019 s real influence over the \u201c postwoke , \u201d or the \u201c Post Left , \u201d or whatever this sensibility comes to be called , might be thought of in a different way .\nThe subculture has the same logic as the tech oligarchy that Thiel embodies .\nIt follows the same rules \u2014 imitate , iterate , transact .\nAt the screening of the Alex Jones documentary , the audience had to sign nondisclosure agreements : legal documents ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival .\nIt was all very Silicon Valley .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "Since then , California suffered not only from its largest wildfire on record \u2014 the August Complex fire that burned 1,032,648 acres and 935 structures \u2014 but also its second- , fourth- , fifth- , sixth- , and seventh-largest fires since at least 1932 when reliable record-keeping began , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .\nThe Pacific Northwest also experienced its deadliest heat wave on record .\nTennessee was hit by record rainfall for a 24-hour period , and similar records were obliterated in the Northeast due to the remnants of Hurricane Ida .\nMy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on record .\nOr the second-hottest year , depending on the analysis .\n2020 was the year that Australia burned in its deadly Bushfire season and a record number of locusts swarmed the Horn of Africa \u2014 both calamities expected in a warming climate .\n\u201c There are a ton of options , \u201d said Edward Carr of Clark University , a coauthor of the new report .\nThe biggest tragedy , he added , would be if we don \u2019 t act now on the climate solutions we already have .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair thing to do to a generation of kids coming up right now.\n\u201d But my daughter \u2019 s future is not already doomed .\nThat \u2019 s a key takeaway from the more than 3,000-page report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which outlines the many ways that society can act to not only better respond and adapt to the warming that \u2019 s here , but also stave off a perilously hot world of no return .\nA new climate report released this week , called \u201c Climate Change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d makes clear that climate impacts will permeate her childhood .\nIt also details how kids worldwide are especially vulnerable to the crisis , with even more warming on the way .\nMy daughter is not yet 2 years old .\nIn her short life , she has only known a world dramatically altered by human-made climate change .\nIn her lifetime , she will face a future of worse floods , heat waves , droughts , extinctions , and more calamities ensured by continually rising temperatures .\nElsewhere in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Atami in Shizuoka prefecture , entire villages were inundated by torrential downpours in Western Germany , and a wildfire destroyed Canada \u2019 s town of Lytton .\nSome of these disasters pose real risks of physical harm to kids .\nTake extreme heat and heat waves : Pregnant people , babies , and young kids are all more vulnerable to heat than older kids and most adults because their bodies aren \u2019 t as good at cooling and staying that way .\nStudies even show that an unborn child \u2019 s exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could result in negative health outcomes later , such as lower birth weight .\nFor older kids , as the number of hot days increases with global warming , they risk greater exposure to the heat in schools without air conditioning and during outdoor activities , like sports .\nThis latest IPCC assessment also discusses how disasters , both the acute exposure to one and then the longer-term recovery from one , can damage the mental health and well-being of everyone impacted , especially kids .\nAfter major flooding occurred in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers tracked the health of people whose homes flooded and did not flood , according to Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington , who helped co-write the report \u2019 s chapter on health .\n\u201c There was a very clear difference in probable anxiety , depression , and post-traumatic stress disorder \u201d between the different groups , she explained .\nHeadline-spurring disasters , which are growing more frequent and more intense , are perhaps the most obvious signs of how 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming , compared to pre-industrial times , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more climate impacts already here , as the new report exhaustively details .\nEven before my daughter was born , for example , two species went extinct and climate change played a role : the Golden toad in Costa Rica in 1990 , as well as Australia \u2019 s Bramble Cay melomys , a type of rodent , in 2016 .\nAnd a third species got perilously close to extinction : Australia \u2019 s lemuroid ringtail possum .\nAnd there have been far more local extinctions : Climate-linked local extinctions were detected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species examined .\nThe impact of climate change on top of existing problems of food availability and high prices can be a \u201c lethal combination for kids , \u201d said Rachel Bezner Kerr of Cornell University , a coauthor on the IPCC chapter on food systems , \u201c especially in low-income countries , especially low-income households , especially in rural areas.\n\u201d \u201c So we have one study that showed between 1993 and 2012 , increased temperatures was significantly related to children \u2019 s wasting in 30 countries in Africa , \u201d she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is too thin for their height , according to the World Health Organization .\nMalnutrition is already a huge problem in kids in certain developing nations , and that problem will only get bigger in a warmer world if action isn \u2019 t specifically taken to avoid that possibility .\nHow Hot Will It Get In My Daughter \u2019 s Lifetime ?\nWhen world leaders signed the Paris climate agreement in 2016 , they agreed to jointly limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius ( about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now scientists predict that it is \u201c more likely than not \u201d that global average temperatures will pass 1.5 degrees in the coming decades , no matter what .\nIt could happen by 2030 , when my daughter is only 10 years old .\nThat \u2019 s why the next few years matter so much .\nHow quickly people cut their greenhouse gas emissions this decade will help dictate how the 1.5-degree threshold is exceeded and what happens next .\nWill temperatures keep going up or will they start to come back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start adapting to the warming that \u2019 s already here and locked in for the future will minimize the damage associated with the crisis .\nBy 2030 , for example , it \u2019 s possible that countries will embrace the bold goal of protecting at least 30 % of the planet \u2019 s land and water .\nIf so , that could have cascading benefits , from keeping some species alive to bolstering natural ecosystems that protect against floods , help suck up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a half-decarbonized power supply for homes and vehicles by 2030 , per the report , the country could expect to prevent 55,000-69,000 deaths in that year .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that urban areas may see their exposure to flooding go up 2.7 times by 2030 compared to 2000 , or that an additional 48,000 children under the age of 15 globally may die from diarrhea , or that the number of people living in extreme poverty may increase by 122 million , or that extreme droughts in the Amazon will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indigenous peoples to cities , or that freshwater will be severely limited for some small islands .\nBy 2040 , when my daughter is 20 , the glacier on Africa \u2019 s tallest mountain , Mt .\nKilimanjaro in Tanzania , may be gone .",

Kerkhoff testified last week , saying she gave Reffitt verbal warnings before deploying the pepperball launcher she was carrying .\nDesCamp said that Reffitt responded to Kerkhoff with words to the effect of \u201c you can \u2019 t stop us all \u201d and \u201c let us in.\n\u201d Questioned by Welch , DesCamp said Reffitt didn \u2019 t make a direct threat against Kerkhoff or other officers , but he believed it was \u201c implied \u201d given the situation .\nThe jury again saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that showed Reffitt \u2019 s encounter with police on the stairway .\nDesCamp recalled how the pepperballs and more painful projectiles didn \u2019 t stop Reffitt , but pepper spray finally did .\nAs the crowd surged up the stairs , DesCamp said he tried to block another doorway that led to a platform closer to entrances to the Capitol .\nHe said members of the mob pushed against him , pinning his arms , and that they twice removed his gas mask , sprayed him with a chemical , and then replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance that seemed like a cleaning solution , and he said he felt OK to stay .\nBut next it was bear spray , and \u201c that had a bad effect , \u201d he said , chuckling at the understatement .\nSgt .\nMatthew Flood told the jury that he was with DesCamp and Kerkhoff at the top of the stairway and deployed pepper spray against Reffitt .\nHe said that as he moved down the steps to get closer to Reffitt , the danger increased because he \u2019 d left the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pulled into the crowd .\nNestler , the assistant US attorney , had Flood confirm he was right-handed , and then asked why he was holding the spray canister in his left hand .\nFlood said it was so that he could access the firearm on his belt if needed .\nWelch noted that Flood didn \u2019 t actually draw his gun .\nNestler got back up to have Flood explain why .\nFlood said the officers were being overwhelmed and he \u2019 d noticed people in the crowd wearing tactical gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be armed .\nHe said he was worried that if took out his gun , others in the crowd would do the same , making the situation even more dangerous .\nFlood at one point said it seemed as though Reffitt was \u201c leading \u201d the crowd behind him up the stairs .\nWelch had both officers confirm that Reffitt never touched them , wasn \u2019 t involved in trying to disarm them or spray them , and that they didn \u2019 t see him inside the building .\nThe lead FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , Special Agent Thomas Ryan , walked the jury through evidence of Reffitt \u2019 s overall movements and timeline .\nRyan explained that investigators pulled location data from a Life360 tracking app on Reffitt \u2019 s phone and plotted his movement from Wylie , Texas , to Washington between Jan. 4 and Jan. 6 .\nThe jury then saw the location data on Jan. 6 that showed his movement from a hotel in Georgetown to the National Mall , and then to the Capitol .\nThe jury also saw a receipt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled with Reffitt and received partial immunity to testify , said they \u2019 d stayed .\nQuestioned by Reffitt \u2019 s lawyer , Ryan confirmed that it was his idea to buy a holster on Amazon for the government to use as a demonstrative during the trial that matched the model of a holster that FBI agents found and photographed in Reffitt \u2019 s home , but didn \u2019 t take with them \u201c for whatever reason.\n\u201d On Friday , the lead FBI agent in Reffitt \u2019 s case based in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photo of Reffitt at the Capitol wearing what he said was the same holster , along with a \u201c silvery metallic linear object \u201d in the holster that the government contends was Reffitt \u2019 s Smith & Wesson pistol .",

        "content": "Most people spend about a third of their entire life asleep \u2014 but for many , the activity isn \u2019 t as natural or comforting as it could be .\nUp to 70 million adults in the US have a disorder that disrupts their sleep , according to the American Sleep Association , resulting in about $ 16 billion in medical costs each year .\nInsomnia is the most common problem , affecting 1 in 3 adults at some point in their lives , and 1 in 10 chronically .\nPoor sleep has been linked to a variety of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart failure , high blood pressure , depression , obesity , a compromised immune system , and low sex drive .\nIf you can relate to the struggle , you might want to consider trying one medication-free approach : listening to music .\nDecades of research suggest that many kinds of music can help people fall asleep faster and improve overall sleep quality .\nA 2018 online survey of 615 adults published in the journal PLOS One found that 62 % reported occasionally listening to music at night to help them sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , and 4 % used it every night .\n( The researchers noted their sample may not be representative of the general population . )\nWe tried our own ( decidedly unscientific ) Twitter poll to see how many people use music to help them snooze .\nOverall , 28 % ( among 218 respondents ) use it regularly , while about 12 % said they tried it but it didn \u2019 t work for them .\nIf listening to music before bed sounds like an appealing way to doze off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 who can help you use this technique successfully .\n\u201c Music therapy and its research in sleep is gaining traction as a novel , culturally sensitive , cost-effective , and safe intervention , \u201d Joanne Loewy , a music therapist and founding director of the Louis Armstrong Center of Music and Medicine at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Our brain likes predictability and thrives on patterning .\nSo , with music and music therapy , we have special ways of addressing sleep by helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music probably won \u2019 t replace doctor-prescribed medication or therapies for sleep problems , you don \u2019 t need to have a sleep disorder or be musically inclined to try it for better sleep .\nWhy does music help some people \u2019 s sleep ?\nListening to music throughout the day can often help people feel good and distract them from stressors that can contribute to anxiety or depression .\nTurns out , the same is true at nighttime , and music can help some people fall asleep faster and have better-quality sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the International Journal of Nursing Studies , 25 adults with chronic insomnia who tuned into \u201c soothing \u201d music for 45 minutes before bed over four days had improved overall rest , shortened stage two sleep ( a lighter stage in non-REM sleep ) , and prolonged REM sleep compared to a control group who didn \u2019 t listen to music .\nREM sleep is associated with dreams and deeper slumber , which is critical for cognitive function , memory , emotional processing , and learning .\nA 2014 study published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a similar finding among young adults with long sleep latency , meaning they took an average of 10 minutes or longer to fall asleep .\nPart of the reason listening to music can help you sleep is that it can lower the stress hormone cortisol , release pleasure and satisfaction neurotransmitters such as dopamine , and nudge your nervous system from \u201c fight or flight \u201d to \u201c rest and digest mode , \u201d according to Dr. Michael Jaffee , director of the Neurology Sleep Clinic at the University of Florida .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart rates can synchronize to music over time .\nThis phenomenon , called entrainment , encourages relaxation .\nJaffee told BuzzFeed News that much of the music that improves sleep quality generally plays at about 60 to 80 beats per minute , which is close to an adult 's normal resting heart rate of about 60 to 100 beats per minute .\n( Music has also been shown to have this effect on premature infants , improving their feeding behaviors and sucking patterns . )\nListening to music before bed can distract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , similar to white noise machines .\nUnlike music , however , white noise ( think whirring fans or radio static ) emits consistent and simultaneous sounds at the same frequencies that can drown out more intermittent and distracting background noises .\nSleep researchers often consider nature sounds like rain or waterfalls to be white noise , as well .\nWhite noise is not as well studied as music for sleep , but the former can be more beneficial for some people because its consistency may be less of a distraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a musicologist who works in the Empirical Musicology Laboratory at the University of New South Wales in Australia .\nHowever , white noise could be less of a helpful sleeping tool for people who find it boring , he added .\nThe genres of music that help people sleep vary widely .\n( Dickson said his research has found anything from classical to ambient music to pop and folk songs can work . )\nYou should try whatever type of music you think works for you , but it may be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch , don \u2019 t encourage dancing , have a smooth sound , and do n't have lyrics .\nAnd you \u2019 ll want to avoid wearing headphones while you sleep , Jaffee said , because they could cause hearing damage or headaches ; they could also prevent you from hearing any safety alarms or problems in your home .\nInstead , experts recommend playing music on a speaker with an automatic timer so it doesn \u2019 t play all night long .\nWith that said , tuning into your music might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who finds it annoying .\nSome negotiating with your partner may be necessary .\nJust remember you have to be patient , Dickson warns .\nGenerally , studies show it takes about three to four weeks of consistent listening at bedtime , at the same time every night , for music to improve sleep quality .\nJaffee recommends first listening to music during the day to see if it sparks relaxation and joy that might help you sleep at night .\n( Avoid music that triggers strong emotional reactions , which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters too .\nAim for anything under 50 decibels ( about as loud as a quiet refrigerator or moderate rainfall ) , Dickson said , or just start with a volume that \u2019 s \u201c as quietly as comfortably possible.\n\u201d Here are some general healthy sleep habits you should follow : \u2022 Keep your bedroom as dark as possible \u2022 Exercise before 2 p.m. \u2014 otherwise , endorphins can make it hard to fall asleep \u2022 Go to

sleep 12 to 16 hours ) Keep in mind that any random music may or may not do the trick for you .\nPopular sleep and relaxation apps like Calm , Headspace , and BetterSleep may be a better option ; they offer prerecorded music or allow you to create your own sound clips .\nFor an even more custom approach , music therapists can select or create tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMusic therapists are trained in psychology , medicine , and music and work as independent clinicians alongside doctors , psychologists , audiologists , social workers , and behavioral health specialists , to name a few .\nFor years

.\nMusic therapists also treat people who still have trouble sleeping despite medication or cognitive behavioral therapy , which helps people change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy bedtime habits .\nAnyone can call and make an appointment with a music therapist to address sleep problems , but people are most often referred to the professionals by other doctors such as psychiatrists , said Loewy , the New York\u2013based music therapist .\nIn the beginning , a music therapist will \u201c prescribe \u201d helpful sleep habits , Loewy said , like avoiding food at least a couple of hours before bed .\nOther sessions address why you can \u2019 t sleep , your childhood , lifetime traumas , bedtime habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to different sounds and instruments .\nThe result : They can create custom-made tunes or playlists just for you .\nUsing a sleep music sedation protocol she developed , Loewy starts by playing music or songs that are familiar or induce feelings of safety in people .\nNext , she removes any lyrics , if patients want , and changes the meter ( beats and bars ) .\nThen she may implement instrumental sounds and rework pitch , harmony , and melody to match and enhance the person \u2019 s breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet simple collection of sounds that \u2019 s predictable , repetitive , and comforting , \u201c which is what the brain is looking for to relax , \u201d Loewy said .\nAfter several real-time listening sessions in a clinical setting to see how patients react to the music , she then may prescribe playlists for at-home listening beginning half an hour before sleep .\nFor some , these playlists may last 15 to 20 minutes , but for others with severe anxiety , for example , they may last about 40 minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no formula for music therapy sessions or treatments , including how long each visit lasts ; treatment plans can range from three months to five years .\nIt just depends on a person \u2019 s unique circumstances , she said .\nA 60-year-old who \u2019 s worried because her son recently lost a job , for instance , may need longer sessions than a 25-year-old dealing with a noisy upstairs neighbor .\nWhile sleep apps can

restaurant.\n\u201d There are currently 9,712 board-certified music therapists , a spokesperson for the Certification Board for Music Therapists told BuzzFeed News .\nOf that number , 9,129 work in the US .\nA 2019 survey conducted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 million people received music therapy services in 2018 , according to responses from nearly 3,000 professionals .\nHowever , it \u2019 s

sessions are about $ 88 per hour .\nDepending on where you live , music therapy is a reimbursable service through Medicare or Medicaid .\nSome private insurance companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pay for the service , the AMTA says .\nGenerally , music therapy , like other types , is reimbursable when it \u2019 s preapproved and \u201c deemed medically or behaviorally

BuzzFeed \u2019 s own Twitter poll found about 61 % of respondents said they can \u2019 t listen to music at night .\nSome said they run their TV on a timer , listen to the radio instead , or scroll on social media until they doze off .\nIt \u2019 s probably because \u201c music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Dickson said .\n\u201c Anecdotally , I 've heard from some musicians that they find music too distracting for sleep , and maybe this is because they intellectualize the music instead of relaxing to it.\n\u201d A 2021 study published in the journal Psychological Science found that people who listen to music more often ( particularly popular or catchy songs , either during the day or before bed ) are more likely to catch \u201c earworms \u201d \u2014 when a song or tune plays over and over in your mind \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater difficulty falling asleep , more nighttime awakenings , and more time spent in lighter stages of sleep among the approximately 250 study participants who either answered survey questions or slept in a sleep clinic .\nThe researchers from Baylor University in Texas said their results suggest our brains process music while we sleep , and that listening to familiar music before bed may not be in our best interest .\nBut fear not , Loewy said .\nThere \u2019 s really no specific person or group of people that should avoid using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re interested , she suggests seeking a professional \u2019 s help if you feel you need it .\nAnd if it doesn \u2019 t work , there are other treatment options .\n\u201c Here 's a technique that could help a lot of people , but in many cases needs to be individualized or tailored to the individual based on their unique tastes and preferences , \u201d Jaffee said .\nMusic as a sleep aid \u201c shares commonality , but at the same time with that individuality , speaks to who @ @ @ @ @ @",

        "content": "It \u2019 s that time of year again .\nOn Sunday , March 13 , most people in the US will \u201c spring forward \u201d \u2014 aka lose an hour of sleep as the clocks move ahead \u2014 and enter daylight saving time ( DST ) .\nThis means less sunlight in the morning and more of it in the evening , which you may consider a one-way ticket back into , or out of , the winter blues , depending on whether you \u2019 re a night owl or early bird .\nWhile DST can be a sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s not all sunshine and rainbows .\nThis 60-minute shift , although seemingly small , can have a larger impact on your health besides making you an hour late for brunch on Sunday morning .\nThat \u2019 s because DST disrupts your circadian rhythm \u2014 the 24-hour body clock that \u2019 s governed by light \u2014 by forcing it to follow an unnatural schedule until November when the clocks switch back to standard time .\nCircadian rhythms are a complex interaction of genes , enzymes , and hormones that control your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune function , digestion , blood pressure , body temperature , and blood sugar , just to name a few .\nEven if you pay no attention to the time , just about every tissue , organ , and cell in your body has an internal clock .\nSo pushing those gears one hour forward can have consequences that could last for weeks or maybe even months .\nOne of the most obvious is sleep disruption , which is often to blame for the temporary rise in traffic accidents ( along with driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and injuries after the start of DST .\nThe time change has also been linked to a risk , at least in the short term , of heart attack and stroke .\nMeanwhile , DST doesn \u2019 t offer any obvious health benefits , Joseph Takahashi , an expert on biological clocks and chair of the neuroscience department at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , told BuzzFeed News .\nOf course , some people love DST because of the extra evening light that gives them a serotonin boost and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or school .\nBut not all US states and territories observe it .\nHawaii and Arizona ( excluding the Navajo Nation ) , do not , nor do the US territories of American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the Virgin Islands .\n( About one-quarter of the world follows DST . )\nIf you live somewhere that makes the DST shift , here \u2019 s what to know about how it may affect your body clock and what it can mean for your health .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ social clock , which dictates when we go to work , school , and hang out with friends .\nOur biological clocks , which follow the sun , can \u2019 t always keep up with the change .\n( Lots of clocks , I know ) .\nThe result is what scientists call \u201c circadian misalignment , \u201d or \u201c social jetlag.\n\u201d While you may be able to adapt to the change in a couple of days , some people struggle more , particularly those with sleep disorders , jobs with inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other conditions such as autism .\nBut no matter who you are or what you do for a living , your body clock never really \u201c adjusts , \u201d Dr. Beth Malow , a professor of neurology and director of the sleep disorders division at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c I think you could say you adjust to the sleep loss in a few days , but from a circadian alignment standpoint , you 're really off the whole period of time , \u201d Malow said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on with the light and what 's going on with our bodies .\nIt kind of jars the system in a way that just moving time zones might not.\n\u201d What \u2019 s more , not all body clocks are the same ; about 80 % of people have a circadian rhythm that \u2019 s slower than 24 hours , whereas the remaining 20 % have one that runs a bit faster , Takahashi said , which might explain why some people take longer to get used to the DST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s the trillions of microscopic clocks ticking inside every cell in your body .\n\u201c You can imagine that this mismatch in the synchronization of our clocks is not optimal and that just exacerbates many other aspects of our cellular function , \u201d Takahashi said , \u201c and perhaps maybe that 's what tips the balance.\n\u201d Daylight saving time will likely disrupt your sleep Experts agree the internal disarray caused by \u201c springing forward \u201d leaves the biggest mark on our sleep , according to the Society for Research on Biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insomnia , daytime fatigue , irritability , lack of energy , and difficulty thinking straight .\nA study of 55,000 people in Central Europe published in 2007 in the journal Current Biology found that on \u201c free days \u201d people reverted back to their biological clock instead of the social clock during DST .\nThe researchers also followed a subgroup of 50 people for eight weeks around both time changes ; the volunteers were either night owls , who preferred to stay up late and sleep in , or morning larks , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed earlier .\nThe study found that while their sleep and peak activity levels quickly adjusted to the end of DST , they never really adapted to the change in spring , particularly if they were night owls .\nThe researchers say their findings suggest this \u201c incomplete adjustment \u201d isn \u2019 t just short-term , but can last for the entirety of DST .\nDaylight saving time affects other aspects of our health , too DST is also associated with an increase in heart attack rates .\nFor example , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart , researchers looked at patients admitted to Michigan hospitals .\nThey found that over three years , there was a 24 % increase in the number of heart attacks on the Mondays after the start of DST compared with other Mondays of the year .\nOn the Tuesdays following the return to standard time , there was a 21 % drop in the number of heart attacks .\nThe researchers concluded that DST \u2019 s impact is limited to the timing of heart attacks and not the overall incidence ; the abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as heightened stress related to starting a new work week , may trigger events in people who would have had them at some other point .\nStroke rates have also been found to jump after DST .\nIn a study of hospitalized patients in Finland , stroke rates were 8 % higher in the two days after the start of DST compared with rates in the two weeks before and after .\nThe 2016 study was published in the journal Sleep Medicine .\nA 2020 study published in the Journal of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d among healthcare workers in the Mayo Clinic Health System increased about 19 % in the week after the springtime change compared to the week prior .\nThese errors included giving people incorrect medications or dosages , mislabeling laboratory samples , and making mistakes during surgery .\nThere was no increase in errors made around the end of DST in the fall .\nA 2009 study of mine workers from a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health database found workers experience more injuries , and more severe injuries , the Mondays right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s also some evidence that suggests a link between DST and increased traffic accidents , which could be explained by tired drivers traveling during darker mornings .\nA study looking at 21 years of data on car accidents in the US found that about an additional 28 car accident-related fatalities occurred during the workweek after the DST transition compared to any other week .\nThe findings were published in 2020 in the journal Current Biology .\nAnyone can be thrown off when the time changes in the middle of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others .\nTeenagers , for example , face some of the greatest risks of sleep deprivation following the DST change because they already deal with chronic sleep issues during the school week , according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine .\nThere \u2019 s a biological explanation , too , Malow of Vanderbilt said .\nTeens release their natural melatonin levels an average of two hours later than adults because their body clocks shift to a later period during puberty .\nSo when DST comes around , their already altered sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only made worse with their busy social lives , early school schedules , and any jobs they may have .\nShift workers who work unusual hours are also more likely to struggle with DST .\nSome members of this group already have shift work disorder ( a type of circadian rhythm disorder ) , which causes them to sleep up to four hours less than the average worker and have poor sleep quality overall , the AASM says .\nPeople who live on the US West Coast , where the difference in social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the East Coast , may also feel the shift more .\nChanges in mental health after the switch to DST may be more noticeable or serious in people with seasonal affective disorder \u2014 a type of depression related to seasonal changes and lack of sunlight \u2014 who are sensitive to disturbances in their body clocks .\nMalow said people with certain conditions that make them vulnerable to changes in their daily patterns , like autism and bipolar disorder , are more likely to experience severe disruptions in their mood and functioning following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoothest transition into daylight saving time If you haven \u2019 t guessed already , you \u2019 ll definitely want to prioritize sleep around the start of DST .\nMalow suggests going to bed a little earlier ( about 15 to 20 minutes ) two to three days before the switch to DST \u2014 that way you \u2019 ll be extra rested when that hour is taken from you later on .\nAnd try not to sleep in on the day of the switch , Malow said .\n\u201c You want to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy early , but 7 or 8 a.m. , and get exposed to the bright light because that light in the morning will help you reset yourself.\n\u201d Here are some other ways you can minimize DST \u2019 s impact on your sleep and overall health : \u2022 Start your daily routines , such as eating dinner , that serve as time cues for your body in the days before the DST switch a bit earlier \u2022 Set your clocks ahead one hour Saturday evening so you start adjusting before the time actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep at your normal bedtime \u2022 Go to bed at your usual time on Sunday night to be well rested for the workweek \u2022 Ensure healthy sleep habits : Get seven to nine hours of rest a night , keep your bedroom dark and cool , and avoid caffeine or alcohol before bed Is daylight saving time here to stay ?\nYou either love it or hate it , but DST is here to stay \u2014 at least for now .\nIn an effort to conserve fuel , the US first adopted DST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War I .\nHowever , the move was unpopular and it was reversed after the war ; people didn \u2019 t like waking up in the dark , especially in the winter .\nDST was then standardized in the US in 1966 , with the same energy conservation idea in mind ( policymakers assumed people wouldn \u2019 t need to use energy in the evening because of extra sunlight ) .\nEven though that didn \u2019 t turn out to be the case , DST persevered , with some modifications along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly 20 states have initiated the legal process to adopt yearlong DST , with Florida being the first to enact legislation for permanent DST ( Congress has yet to approve the bill ) .\nMeanwhile , doctors and scientists are itching on the sidelines .\nIn 2020 , the AASM published a position statement in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine that called for the elimination of \u201c seasonal time changes in favor of a national , fixed , year-round time , \u201d stating that evidence shows standard time \u201c aligns best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits for public health and safety.\n\u201d The statement was endorsed by over 20 organizations , including the American Academy of Cardiovascular Sleep Medicine , Society for Research on Biological Rhythms , American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine , National PTA , and National Safety Council .",

social media scrolling always promises something new with the next scroll.\n\u201d One group of researchers blames FOMO , or the \u201c fear of missing out , \u201d on this nocturnal obsession with social media at night .\nIt also may be hard to stop scrolling at night during dark times like a pandemic , climate change-related disasters , or war .\nConstantly checking your phone may give you a sense of control , but often at the expense of more anxiety , depression , and disrupted sleep .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be bad for your health Put simply , excessive phone or technology use , no matter the time of day , promotes a sedentary lifestyle , which the World Health Organization has called \u201c one of the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health problems of our time.\n\u201d ( This was back in 2002 before personal devices with screens became more accessible ! )\nAnd it \u2019 s not just the fact that screentime means you are moving less ; spending too much time on your phone can take the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleep included .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an opportunity cost when you 're on your screen , \u201d said Hale , who is also chair of the board at the National Sleep Foundation .\n\u201c You might not be studying for school , connecting with family , or sleeping.\n\u201d A 2019 study of 106 healthy people mostly in their 20s that was published in the journal Sleep found those who ranked high on the bedtime procrastination scale spent about 61 more minutes per day on their phone before bed compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , bedtime procrastinators had more depression , anxiety , and insomnia , and went to bed 50 minutes later , and woke up 46 minutes later , on average , than their procrastination-free counterparts .\n( All participants answered questionnaires , kept a seven-day sleep diary , and completed time use surveys ; however , the researchers noted their sample may not be representative of the general population . )\nHale and a coauthor published a review of 67 studies conducted between 1999 to 2014 .\nThey found that screen use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedtimes for teens and children in 90 % of the studies they looked at .\nHere \u2019 s another factor to consider : Digital screens happen to emit blue light , one of the shorter yet higher energy wavelengths on the visible light spectrum .\nResearch shows blue light may suppress the production of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin , which helps induce sleep .\nWhat tools can you use to limit screentime ?\nWhile app developers want to keep you engaged for as long as possible , most of them do offer tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what I don \u2019 t think ( anecdotally ) many people do \u2014 I set up time limits on my social media apps like Facebook , Instagram , and TikTok to help manage my screen use before bed with the hopes of getting more sleep .\nTikTok allows users to set daily screen limits of 40 , 60 , 90 , and 120 minutes via its digital well-being section in the app \u2019 s settings .\nWhen you reach your limit , the screen blacks out and you \u2019 re required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app .\nI chose 40 minutes because that seemed like more than enough time to mindlessly watch videos about DIY crafts and puppies , but I couldn \u2019 t have been more wrong .\nNearly every notification that popped up over the course of a week caught me by surprise ;

        "content": "It \u2019 s that time of year again .\nOn Sunday , March 13 , most people in the US will \u201c spring forward \u201d \u2014 aka lose an hour of sleep as the clocks move ahead \u2014 and enter daylight saving time ( DST ) .\nThis means less sunlight in the morning and more of it in the evening , which you may consider a one-way ticket back into , or out of , the winter blues , depending on whether you \u2019 re a night owl or early bird .\nWhile DST can be a sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s not all sunshine and rainbows .\nThis 60-minute shift , although seemingly small , can have a larger impact on your health besides making you an hour late for brunch on Sunday morning .\nThat \u2019 s because DST disrupts your circadian rhythm \u2014 the 24-hour body clock that \u2019 s governed by light \u2014 by forcing it to follow an unnatural schedule until November when the clocks switch back to standard time .\nCircadian rhythms are a complex interaction of genes , enzymes , and hormones that control your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune function , digestion , blood pressure , body temperature , and blood sugar , just to name a few .\nEven if you pay no attention to the time , just about every tissue , organ , and cell in your body has an internal clock .\nSo pushing those gears one hour forward can have consequences that could last for weeks or maybe even months .\nOne of the most obvious is sleep disruption , which is often to blame for the temporary rise in traffic accidents ( along with driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and injuries after the start of DST .\nThe time change has also been linked to a risk , at least in the short term , of heart attack and stroke .\nMeanwhile , DST doesn \u2019 t offer any obvious health benefits , Joseph Takahashi , an expert on biological clocks and chair of the neuroscience department at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , told BuzzFeed News .\nOf course , some people love DST because of the extra evening light that gives them a serotonin boost and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or school .\nBut not all US states and territories observe it .\nHawaii and Arizona ( excluding the Navajo Nation ) , do not , nor do the US territories of American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , Puerto Rico , and the Virgin Islands .\n( About one-quarter of the world follows DST . )\nIf you live somewhere that makes the DST shift , here \u2019 s what to know about how it may affect your body clock and what it can mean for your health .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ social clock , which dictates when we go to work , school , and hang out with friends .\nOur biological clocks , which follow the sun , can \u2019 t always keep up with the change .\n( Lots of clocks , I know ) .\nThe result is what scientists call \u201c circadian misalignment , \u201d or \u201c social jetlag.\n\u201d While you may be able to adapt to the change in a couple of days , some people struggle more , particularly those with sleep disorders , jobs with inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other conditions such as autism .\nBut no matter who you are or what you do for a living , your body clock never really \u201c adjusts , \u201d Dr. Beth Malow , a professor of neurology and director of the sleep disorders division at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c I think you could say you adjust to the sleep loss in a few days , but from a circadian alignment standpoint , you 're really off the whole period of time , \u201d Malow said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on with the light and what 's going on with our bodies .\nIt kind of jars the system in a way that just moving time zones might not.\n\u201d What \u2019 s more , not all body clocks are the same ;

        "content": "If you \u2019 re lucky , sexual activity , either alone or with a partner/partners ( no judgment here ) , will lead up to that highly anticipated burst of pleasure known as an orgasm .\nResearch suggests orgasms can do more than make you feel good \u2014 they may also help you sleep better .\nWhile you may have already figured this out yourself , you might not know that the benefit is a two-way street ; quality sleep may also help you orgasm ( whereas poor sleep can do the opposite ) .\n\u201c Orgasms make you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is in a state of bliss and relaxation .\nWhether it is achieved solo , or with a partner , it promotes connectedness with your mind , body , spirit , and soul , \u201d Dr. Angela Jones , an OB-GYN in private practice in New Jersey , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c When these things are in order , you guessed it , so will be your sleep.\n\u201d Evidence suggests orgasms may help you sleep better As you might imagine , conducting studies on whether orgasms help people sleep is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep researcher and senior lecturer at the Appleton Institute for Behavioral Science at CQUniversity Adelaide in Australia .\nMost studies on orgasms and sleep are based on self-reported surveys that tend to underrepresent LGBTQ people and their experiences .\n\u201c Of the few studies that have attempted this feat , there has been a considerable argument to suggest that sexual activity that involves an orgasm may improve sleep , \u201d Lastella told BuzzFeed News in an email .\nIn one of his studies published in 2019 in the journal Frontiers in Public Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey responses from 778 people who were mostly in their 20s or 30s and heterosexual ( more than 90 % ) .\nThe researchers found that 68 % of men and 59 % of women felt that they slept better after having sex with a partner .\nAbout 54 % of the volunteers said they also slept better after having an orgasm from masturbation , regardless of gender .\nHowever , some people \u2014 11 % of women and 4 % of men \u2014 said they had a harder time falling asleep after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his study didn \u2019 t seek to understand why , Lastella said it \u201c may be related to the experience they have with themselves , or their partner.\n\u201d Every body is different , and there \u2019 s really no activity that \u2019 s \u201c always a positive or negative experience for everyone , \u201d Sara Flowers , vice president of education and training at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Some people feel calm , relaxed , or sleepy after an orgasm .\nOthers may feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flowers , who emphasized more research is needed to better understand the orgasmic experiences of people of different gender identities , sexual orientations , races and ethnicities , abilities , and more .\n\u201c Paying attention to your own experiences and patterns can help you figure out how orgasms may help or hinder your sleep , \u201d she said .\nOrgasms , at least from masturbation , didn \u2019 t seem to affect sleep either positively or negatively in one small study published in 1985 in the journal Biological Psychiatry .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold standard for sleep research that measures brain waves , blood oxygen levels , heart and breathing rates , as well as eye and leg movements \u2014 on five men and five women following masturbation with and without orgasm .\nThey found that masturbation seemed to have no major effect on sleep , regardless of orgasm .\nThe experimental groups were compared to a control group that involved reading \u201c neutral \u201d material .\nWhy could orgasms help you sleep better ?\nOrgasms give you a boost in physical and emotional well-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called endorphins , many of which happen to have important sleep-related duties .\nOxytocin , or the \u201c love hormone , \u201d is one of the star players released during orgasms that can give you a warm and fuzzy feeling , Jones said .\nIn addition to its role in sexual activity , it facilitates bonding during childbirth and breastfeeding .\nOxytocin reduces cortisol levels , aka the stress hormone , in our blood too .\n\u201c Cortisol levels increase in the morning , and are responsible for waking you up , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occur during the latter part of the day can cause sleep disruptions , \u201d so having an orgasm at night may help lower them and make you feel less stressed , more relaxed , and sleepy .\nOther activities like yoga , hugging , and spending time with your pets can trigger your brain to release oxytocin as well .\nSerotonin , or the \u201c happy hormone , \u201d also floods your body at the time of climax , \u201c hence the elated mood you all of a sudden feel when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also helps regulate sleep-wake cycles .\nThe brain uses serotonin to form melatonin \u2014 the main sleep-inducing hormone \u2014 at night and releases it during the day .\nLow serotonin levels are linked with depression and insomnia in a wide variety of studies , and increasing it can improve mood and lead to better sleep , Jones said .\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , which include drugs like fluoxetine ( Prozac ) and sertraline ( Zoloft ) , are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and work by increasing serotonin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind is that a major side effect of many SSRIs is a drop in libido or interest in having sex . )\nVasopressin is also released after sex , and it lowers cortisol levels and boosts sleep quality , Jones said , though this hormone may play a larger role during sex in people assigned male at birth .\nAnother important sleep-inducing hormone that orgasms produce is prolactin .\nIt \u2019 s best known for stimulating milk production in people who give birth , but it \u2019 s also associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual satisfaction , Lastella said .\nWhen it comes to slumber , research shows prolactin can induce rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep , which helps your brain process new memories and learned skills .\nStudies also show sleep deprivation can reduce prolactin levels .\nA 2005 paper published in the journal Biological Psychology analyzed prolactin levels in blood samples from 19 men and 19 women who either masturbated or had penis-in-vagina sex in a laboratory until they reached orgasm .\nResearchers found the boost in prolactin following climax was about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with masturbation .\nThis suggests that sex with a partner may be more satisfying \u2014 at least under laboratory conditions , and of course depending on the partner \u2014 than masturbation .\nThe results were adjusted for control conditions , which involved watching an unsexy documentary either solo or with a partner .\nQuality sleep , which for adults generally means sleeping seven to nine hours a night , staying asleep throughout the night , and waking up feeling refreshed , has a multitude of health benefits .\nOver the long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function , boost your mood , and reduce the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease \u2014 advantages that can also improve your sex life .\nSleeping for an extra hour a night , for example , was associated with a 14 % increase in the odds women engaged in sexual activity with their partner , according to a 2015 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine .\nThe research , which was based on survey responses from 171 women taken over two weeks , also found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better genital arousal .\nSleep deprivation , as well as obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a disorder that causes repetitive blockages in airflow during sleep \u2014 have been tied to erectile dysfunction in men and sexual dysfunction in women .\nAnother analysis of 93,668 postmenopausal women between the ages 50 and 79 found sleeping for less than seven to eight hours a night was associated with lower odds of sexual satisfaction , a trend that held true even when adjusting for other causes of sleep deprivation , such as depression and chronic disease .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal Menopause .\nInadequate sleep also affects mental health ; meanwhile , depression and anxiety tend to make people less interested in having sex .\n\u201c Both more sleep and more sex can have positive effects on our immune function , our heart health , pain receptors , stress levels , psychological well-being , and our relationships , \u201d Lastella said .\n\u201c But one of the main problems in modern society is that we don \u2019 t switch off \u2014 we are addicted to our electronic devices , we are attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that delay our sleep onset.\n\u201d How to enhance both sleep and sex Engaging in any activity before bed that helps you relax and enjoy the present moment can have a positive impact on both your sleep and sex life .\nKeep in mind what works for others may not work for you , and vice versa .\nHere are some general healthy sleep habits : \u2022 None Calm down before bed by drinking noncaffeinated tea , taking a low-impact yoga session , meditating , sitting in a hot bath , or listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caffeine , exercise , and cigarettes ( or anything else that can keep you awake ) right before bedtime .\n\u2022 Keep your phone out of the bedroom or put it on \u201c do not disturb mode.\n\u201d \u2022 Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day , plus or minus 20 minutes \u2014 even on the weekends .\n\u2022 Keep pets outside your bedroom , especially cats .\n\u2022 Aim to sleep seven to nine hours a night if you can .\n\u2022 Bring some fresh air into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible .\n\u2022 Consider changing your mattress to one that better suits your body .\n\u2022 Keep your bedroom as dark as possible and fill it with calming items like essential oil diffusers and weighted blankets .\n\u2022 If you wake up in the middle of the night and stay awake for more than 10 minutes , get out of bed and sit somewhere until you feel sleepy .\nWhen it comes to better sex , namely achieving the big O , Jones suggests asking your partner for what you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sex doesn \u2019 t have to be a team sport.\n\u201d Whether you have a partner or not , you can also consider trying sex toys , Flowers of Planned Parenthood said .\n\u201c A first step towards embracing sex and your sexuality may be getting comfortable with yourself and your body .\nDate yourself .\nWear clothes that make you feel attractive , confident , and good in your body , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Get familiar with your genitals by looking at them in a mirror .\nExplore what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles in a warm bath , physical touch , crisp clean bedsheets , or a run outside , for example .\n\u201d",

        "content": "\u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d In August 2021 , influencer Madison Vining made a big announcement on Instagram .\nAfter becoming one of the top sellers for the multilevel marketing essential oils company Young Living , she was quitting .\nTo her more than 250,000 followers on Instagram and her Young Living team , known as the \u201c Happy Oilers , \u201d the news came as a huge shock .\nYoung Living is one of two of the major essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorker reported in 2017 , along with its main rival DoTerra ( both claim to be the largest oils company in the world , according to the magazine ) .\nBoth reportedly reach $ 1 billion in sales annually and serve millions of customers .\nVining , who had worked for Young Living for more than eight years , had reached \u201c Royal Crown Diamond \u201d status ; sellers with that status make , on average , $ 1,645,692 annually or $ 137,000 a month , according to the company .\nPeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vining and her husband , Tyler , would leave so much money on the table to start from scratch .\nWhen , a few days later , the Vinings announced that they were joining a new wellness-focused MLM , Modere , which is best known for its collagen supplements , rumors swirled that the couple had gotten a huge payout or some other incentive to leave .\nFor months Vining had kept her reasons for leaving Young Living opaque .\nBut recently , she finally began to spill the tea on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave for leaving Young Living ?\nSatan and his demons .\nYes , the prince of darkness .\nVining is just one former top Young Living retailer who this month has either insinuated or flat-out said that they left the company after feeling , as devout Christians , that demonic forces were spreading \u201c darkness \u201d among Young Living members .\nOne former seller , Melissa Truitt , went as far as labeling the company a \u201c cult \u201d in an Instagram story highlight she posted to her account last week and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oily \u201c satanic panic \u201d by posting her series of Instagram stories last week accusing the company of spreading \u201c demonic \u201d propaganda through a New Age self-help book it sent to its members earlier this year .\nShe urged Christians still working for Young Living to flee or risk their souls .\n\u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d Truitt said in an emotional Instagram story .\nTruitt did not return a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not either , and shortly after I reached out , she blocked me on Instagram .\nIn response to the claims , Young Living said it \u201c did not publish and does not endorse this book in any way.\n\u201d In a statement , the company said that the book \u2019 s co-author , Marcella Vonn Harting , who is a top seller at the company , sent the book to \u201c her own list without the company \u2019 s knowledge or consent.\n\u201d The company denied providing Vonn Harting with anyone \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not return a request for comment ) .\n\u201c We support a culture of inclusion that we extend to our employees , customers , and brand partners world-wide , \u201d the statement read .\n\u201c We appreciate and celebrate our members and their diversity of background and belief , and are dedicated to ensuring our brand partners follow our policies and procedures and code of ethics.\n\u201d The influencers and former Young Living retailers \u2019 abrupt declarations that the company is satanic are odd to say the least , especially as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jumped ship to Modere over the past several months , before even receiving the book .\nTruitt , who had reached the second-highest \u201c Diamond \u201d status , also left Young Living five months ago to join Modere .\nAnd other big Young Living sellers slash influencers , like Liz Joy of Pure Joy Home and Monique McLean , abruptly announced they were switching to Modere recently as well .\nIn fact , so many prominent top Young Living sellers have been leaving that last August Young Living sued some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , for breach of contract .\nThe lawsuit , which was filed in federal court in Utah in August 2021 , was dismissed that December at the request of both sides .\nStill , it provides valuable insight into the breakup of the prominent Instagram essential oil sellers and the company .\nIn the complaint , Young Living accused the McLeans and the Vinings of working to cut a deal with Modere to \u201c raid \u201d Young Living \u2019 s business .\n( McLean did not return a request for comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for comment . )\n\u201c The named defendants in this case are former , extremely successful Young Living distributors who have meticulously executed a plan to leave Young Living , join a competing business venture , and take as many Young Living distributors and customers with them as possible , \u201d the lawsuit \u2019 s complaint read .\nYoung Living declined to comment on the lawsuit .\nBut now , the influencers are saying that money or alleged backdoor schemes had nothing to do with their decision to leave .\nVining wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the \u201c tip of the iceberg on this issue , \u201d and she feels better after \u201c denouncing this spiritual darkness \u201d to her followers .\n\u201c I feel a lot of clarity breaking my silence for things that matter in eternity , \u201d she wrote .\nThe denouncement of Young Living as demonic is especially intriguing because so many of its retailers , Vining included , have spent the past several years blending together the principles of alternative wellness and medicine the company espouses with their evangelical Christian beliefs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in 1993 by D. Gary Young , a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who successfully blended his own devout faith with a lifelong passion for alternative remedies .\nIn a newsletter to Young Living members after her husband \u2019 s death in 2018 , Gary \u2019 s wife , Mary , wrote that her husband \u2019 s desire to spread the gospel of essential oils was closely tied to his faith , writing , \u201c God was his foundation.\n\u201d \u201c He founded the essential oil movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never stopped in his desire to serve God \u2019 s children , \u201d Young wrote .\nFor many years , alternative remedies like essential oils were stereotyped to be the purview of hippie-dippie rich people , but , as Rachel Monroe wrote in the New Yorker in 2017 , essential oils have also caught on more broadly among women all over the US .\n\u201c Wellness is often dismissed as frivolity , another way for wealthy white women to spend money and obsess about their bodies , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find essential oils in a small-town drugstore in the Midwest as in an organic market in L.A. \u201d Over the past decade or so , many of the devotees who made it big in Young Living shared similarities with Vining .\nThey were young wives and mothers in the heartland who were devoted evangelical Christians , and they also seemed to have a suspicion of mainstream medicine .\nAccording to Vining , once she stopped buying mainstream medicinal and home products and dove into essential oils , her life changed dramatically .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family had decided to start a \u201c wellness journey \u201d three years before after learning about \u201c the dangers lurking in our home that were making us sick.\n\u201d \u201c There are ingredients in everyday things like baby lotion , dish soap , dryer sheets\u2026 all linked to cancer , infertility , and disease .\nWe just didn \u2019 t know , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c We slowly but surely took a trash bag through our home and began to read labels .\nInto the trash bag went candles , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was setting us or our kiddos up for failure with our health.\n\u201d Vining never specified what ingredients exactly were making her family sick but claimed that once she threw out the products she saw a huge difference .\nAnd once she found Young Living and began using oils , Vining claimed , her family no longer needed to rely on \u201c toxic \u201d Western medicine .\n\u201c We use essential oils for everything in our home , from seasonal irritations outdoors , to first aid type of things , to helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good stuff , and of course restful sleep !\n\u201d she wrote .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve blessed our family so so much.\n\u201d As the Vinings \u2019 platform grew ( in 2017 , Vining wrote she had 58,000 people under her in the business ) , the couple used the proceeds from their essential oil business to spread the gospel of Jesus , effectively combining the two parts of her life .\n\u201c Our prayer has always been that we would use our influence to point everything back to The One who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c We know that this money and this opportunity and this voice have not been given to us because of anything WE have done , and they are not ours.\n\u201d In 2017 , Vining and another Young Living seller made a goal to get Young Living oils into a school in Uganda that was founded by an American evangelical Christian missionary .\nThe Vinings and their partners were eventually able to raise enough funds to get oils and diffusers into every dorm room and classroom at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students \u201c appropriate wellness supplies to prevent icky diseases and unwellness , \u201d Vining wrote .\nShe felt that this plan was a calling from God .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about more than oils , you guys , \u201d Vining wrote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s ALWAYS been about so much more than oils .\nIt \u2019 s about \u2018 wellness , purpose , and abundance \u2019 ( YL \u2019 s slogan ) and it \u2019 s about using ANY platform we are given , to glorify the King.\n\u201d Vining \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career on social media , where she became a prominent Young Living influencer .\nAs her prominence within the \u201c oiler community \u201d grew , so did her online presence , and she went from having 56,000 Instagram followers in September 2018 to more than 200,000 when she quit the company in August 2021 .\nMany other Young Living sellers also found success on social media , where they were able to share their devout faith and their enviable lifestyles while also recruiting new downlines , or Young Living retailers who report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Crown Diamond who was sued by Young Living along with the Vinings last year , grew her platform to more than 29,000 Instagram followers and launched a book and video series called 24 Days of Prayer for Your Business .\nIn the series , McLean led followers virtually on a spiritual devotional aimed at centering their faith in their business ventures , Young Living or otherwise .\nTruitt , who has more than 43,000 Instagram followers , is also open about her Christian faith , often discussing her religion along with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellness , and fitness .\nIt is because these oil peddlers connected their spirituality so closely with their careers that their sudden insistence that the company is now somehow anti-Christian has been so jarring .\nBut according to the oilers , after years of success in Young Living they had begun to feel a darkness creep into the company and that \u2019 s what led them to leave .\nLast week , Truitt kicked off the public drama when she posted a series of Instagram stories about issues she had had with Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven good years of selling Young Living and reaching the second-highest Diamond status , she and her husband began to feel like the company was \u201c changing , \u201d and not for the better .\nTruitt didn \u2019 t specify what these changes were , saying they \u201c couldn \u2019 t really pinpoint it , \u201d but \u201c we heard things that didn \u2019 t really agree with our spirit.\n\u201d After praying about it , they decided to resign from Young Living at the end of 2021 .\n\u201c We knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , \u201d she said .\nTruitt said that , despite having resigned last fall , she received a \u201c demonic \u201d book in the mail earlier this month that she thought was sent from Young Living .\nShe said the company had sent it to all its Diamond-level sellers and claimed that Mary Young , the wife of the late founder , had encouraged the leaders to read the book and pass it along to their downlines .\nThe book , titled My Word Made Flesh , is cowritten by a self-help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a company called Mastery Systems ( Stevens did not return a request for comment ) .\nStevens describes himself on his website as a \u201c masterful facilitator of individuals and organizations that choose to transform their lives into healthy , creative , loving and fulfilling experiences.\n\u201d Stevens wrote the book with Vonn Harting , a Young Living Royal Crown Diamond who moonlights as a motivational speaker , and Young wrote the foreword .\nThe spokesperson for Young Living said Young \u2019 s choice to contribute to the book was separate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Young \u2019 s choice to write a foreword stemmed from her own belief about the use of language to promote positive outcomes and her desire to support a friend , \u201d they said .\n\u201c She wrote her foreword prior to much of the book even being written based on the authors \u2019 intent to teach people how to use positive language to help bring about change in their lives.\n\u201d I attempted to get a copy of My Word Made Flesh to see what it actually contained , but after placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mastery Systems \u2019 website , my order was canceled and refunded with no explanation .\nMy Word Made Flesh has now been scrubbed from the website .\nAccording to Truitt , when she received the book and flipped through it , she was horrified .\n\u201c This book is one of the most darkest and demonic books I \u2019 ve ever had in my house , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I can not wait to get rid of it but I had to share.\n\u201d In Truitt \u2019 s video , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says is My Word Made Flesh .\nThe \u201c demonic \u201d elements of the book , Truitt claimed , include encouraging people to do basically a \u201c seance with oils \u201d and telling them to repeat \u201c I am the resurrection and the life of my lineage.\n\u201d In the Bible , Jesus calls himself \u201c the way , the truth and the life , \u201d and says \u201c no one comes to the Father [ God ] except through me.\n\u201d To Christians like Truitt , she explained , the book \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to imply you are supplanting Jesus \u2019 s spot .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing more false than that , \u201d she says in her Instagram story .\n\u201c Then taking Jesus out of it and putting yourself in there.\n\u201d Truitt warned \u201c believers \u201d who were still in Young Living that if they did what the company asked and brought the book into their household , \u201c it will completely ruin you.\n\u201d \u201c Leaders of Young Living , you received this book , and so if you are hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condoning this evil , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And if you promote it , you need a serious heart check.\n\u201d \u201c This is so much bigger than money , this is so much bigger than day-to-day life , this is eternal significance , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And you have to stand up and rise up and run from this.\n\u201d Vining soon posted on her Instagram stories in support of Truitt , saying that she was proud of Truitt for sharing \u201c the truth.\n\u201d \u201c Believers be discerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy [ Satan ] prowls like a lion , and he can look ( and smell ) really good\u2026 this isn \u2019 t about a book .\nThough that book alone would have been a deal breaker for me\u2026 this is the tip of the iceberg on this issue.\n\u201d Vining added she was praying for clarity to speak out more about her experience with Young Living but knew she had to denounce this \u201c spiritual darkness.\n\u201d The reaction from Truitt \u2019 s community to her denouncement of Young Living was overwhelmingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and for speaking out against \u201c evil.\n\u201d One woman wrote she had considered signing up for Young Living but would not after seeing Truitt \u2019 s stories .\nPeople also slammed Young Living on social media after Truitt spoke out , saying they were blending \u201c oils and the occult.\n\u201d \u201c Am I the only Christian woman who is not surprised one bit that an essential oil company would come out as satanic ?\n\u201d wrote one .\nOther Instagram accounts , like Christian podcast host Blake Guichet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company is \u201c anti-Biblical.\n\u201d Guichet had previously posted \u201c deep dives \u201d into the supposed darkness in Young Living and said she wasn \u2019 t surprised to see Truitt \u2019 s stories .\n\u201c I knew Young Living was into some dark stuff , and everyone thought I was crazy , \u201d she said .\nSince posting about the book , Truitt has erased all mention of her claims from her account .\nShe continues to post memes about spiritual warfare , uploading a C.S .\nLewis quote that reads : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe .\nEvery square inch , every split second is claimed by God , and counterclaimed by Satan.\n\u201d Both Truitt and Vining are now preaching the benefits of their new company Modere , which you can swipe up on their accounts to buy , or even sell , products from if you choose .\n\u201c God did design our bodies to move , \u201d Truitt wrote on Instagram stories , adding , \u201c I have been using Modere products for a while and it \u2019 s just been so different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just flowing out of me.\n\u201d Meanwhile , Young Living \u2019 s social accounts have so far been silent on the controversy .\nThey continue to post about the benefits of oils , encouraging their 1 million followers to \u201c focus on you by taking some time out to practice mindfulness with your favorite essential oil blend.\n\u201d Their followers filled up their comments section with hearts .\n\u25cf",

social media scrolling always promises something new with the next scroll.\n\u201d One group of researchers blames FOMO , or the \u201c fear of missing out , \u201d on this nocturnal obsession with social media at night .\nIt also may be hard to stop scrolling at night during dark times like a pandemic , climate change-related disasters , or war .\nConstantly checking your phone may give you a sense of control , but often at the expense of more anxiety , depression , and disrupted sleep .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be bad for your health Put simply , excessive phone or technology use , no matter the time of day , promotes a sedentary lifestyle , which the World Health Organization has called \u201c one of the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health problems of our time.\n\u201d ( This was back in 2002 before personal devices with screens became more accessible ! )\nAnd it \u2019 s not just the fact that screentime means you are moving less ; spending too much time on your phone can take the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleep included .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an opportunity cost when you 're on your screen , \u201d said Hale , who is also chair of the board at the National Sleep Foundation .\n\u201c You might not be studying for school , connecting with family , or sleeping.\n\u201d A 2019 study of 106 healthy people mostly in their 20s that was published in the journal Sleep found those who ranked high on the bedtime procrastination scale spent about 61 more minutes per day on their phone before bed compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , bedtime procrastinators had more depression , anxiety , and insomnia , and went to bed 50 minutes later , and woke up 46 minutes later , on average , than their procrastination-free counterparts .\n( All participants answered questionnaires , kept a seven-day sleep diary , and completed time use surveys ; however , the researchers noted their sample may not be representative of the general population . )\nHale and a coauthor published a review of 67 studies conducted between 1999 to 2014 .\nThey found that screen use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedtimes for teens and children in 90 % of the studies they looked at .\nHere \u2019 s another factor to consider : Digital screens happen to emit blue light , one of the shorter yet higher energy wavelengths on the visible light spectrum .\nResearch shows blue light may suppress the production of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin , which helps induce sleep .\nWhat tools can you use to limit screentime ?\nWhile app developers want to keep you engaged for as long as possible , most of them do offer tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what I don \u2019 t think ( anecdotally ) many people do \u2014 I set up time limits on my social media apps like Facebook , Instagram , and TikTok to help manage my screen use before bed with the hopes of getting more sleep .\nTikTok allows users to set daily screen limits of 40 , 60 , 90 , and 120 minutes via its digital well-being section in the app \u2019 s settings .\nWhen you reach your limit , the screen blacks out and you \u2019 re required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app .\nI chose 40 minutes because that seemed like more than enough time to mindlessly watch videos about DIY crafts and puppies , but I couldn \u2019 t have been more wrong .\nNearly every notification that popped up over the course of a week caught me by surprise ; I had no idea I \u2019 d already been scrolling for so long .\n( These were mostly nighttime notifications because I don \u2019 t use TikTok much during the day . )\nTo be honest , the interruptions annoyed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , which prompted an internal dialogue about the pros and cons of another five minutes of TikTok versus hitting the hay .\nSometimes it worked and I would surrender my phone to my bedside table , irritated but also appreciative of the sweet relief of darkness on my eyes .\nBut other times I would plug in the passcode , ignoring the tinge of regret that pinched my stomach and knowledge that my future self would be angry \u2014 and tired \u2014 in the morning .\nAt least TikTok greeted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my immediate return ?\nAs another supposed safeguard of my digital well-being , TikTok serves up videos made by top creators \u201c in true TikTok style \u201d to encourage users to take a break and do something IRL , like go for a walk or eat a snack .\nBut it \u2019 s unclear if these videos , which were launched in 2020 , actually accomplish what they \u2019 re designed to do ; a TikTok spokesperson told BuzzFeed News the company doesn \u2019 t share data on how many users exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe company also wouldn \u2019 t tell me how much time must pass before you get one of these videos on your \u201c for you page \u201d ( FYP ) .\nOther sites like Instagram and Facebook also offer daily screentime limits you can set through the app .\nHere \u2019 s how to set screen-use timers on Instagram : \u2022 Go to your profile , click on the three lines in the top right corner , click \u201c your activity \u201d and then \u201c time spent.\n\u201d \u2022 You can set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 10- , 20- , and 30-minute increments or set daily time limits that will send reminders to close the app in 30 minutes , 45 minutes , or in one , two , or three hours .\nHere \u2019 s how to set screen-use timers on Facebook : \u2022 Go to settings and click on \u201c Your Time on Facebook.\n\u201d \u2022 Then select \u201c Manage your Time.\n\u201d Here you can turn on or schedule \u201c quiet mode \u201d or set \u201c daily time reminders \u201d that are available in five-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into their phone \u2019 s general settings and set timers on any app they choose too , and Google and YouTube also offer controls you can use to monitor digital use .\nAnd as counterintuitive as it sounds , there are apps to control your screentime , including Flipd , Space , Flora , and Offtime .\nThey promise to improve your quality of life by limiting mindless scrolling on your phone .\nTips for healthy sleep and phone use around bedtime If you believe you 're spending too much time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still OK to enjoy screentime , according to Dr. Raj Dasgupta , a pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist at the Keck School of Medicine with the University of Southern California .\nWith that said , \u201c there is a certain time and place for everything , especially if you \u2019 re suffering from chronic insomnia , \u201d said Dasgupta , who emphasized people with sleep disorders may require more support than just relinquishing their phones at night .\nStill , \u201c if you want to function better during the day while being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to put the technology away .\nIt \u2019 s all about prioritizing sleep.\n\u201d Ultimately , how much and how well you sleep is about more than technology use before bed .\nIt \u2019 s also about the food you eat , if and when you exercise , and even whether you share a bed with someone .\nPersonally , I think I \u2019 m better off making my bedroom a phone-free environment and using my watch or a traditional alarm clock to wake me up for work .\nBut there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow before quitting nightly screen use cold turkey .\nLike Dasgupta , Hale agrees with keeping phones out of the nighttime picture altogether .\nIn her house , no screens are allowed at the dinner table or bedroom ; she and her family refrain from using their phones an hour before bedtime and charge them in rooms separate from their sleeping space .\nThis tip is especially useful for teens .\nA nationally representative survey of 500 parents and 500 children found that 68 % of teens take their devices to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( girls do this more than boys ) .\nParents are no better , with 62 % of participants saying they keep their devices within bed \u2019 s reach , according to the survey by Common Sense , a nonprofit that works to ensure digital well-being for kids .\nYou \u2019 ll also want to refrain from doing anything in bed that \u2019 s not sleeping or sexual activity , the Amerian Sleep Association ( ASA ) says .\nThat means no TV , no reading , no tablets , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use screens at night , the ASA suggests wearing blue light\u2013blocking glasses at least two hours before bed to help improve duration and quality of sleep .\nAnother healthy sleep habit is to avoid daytime naps , or take them with caution .\nThe ASA says naps can make us less sleepy at night , causing us to have difficulty falling asleep and wake up several times mid-slumber .\nHere are some other tips for healthy sleep : \u2022 Calm down before bed by drinking noncaffeinated tea , taking a low-impact yoga session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath , or listening to music .\n\u2022 Avoid alcohol , caffeine , exercise , and cigarettes ( or anything else that can keep you awake ) right before bedtime .\n\u2022 Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day , plus or minus 20 minutes \u2014 even on the weekends .\n\u2022 Keep pets outside your bedroom , especially cats .\n\u2022 Aim to sleep seven to nine hours a night if you can ( children should sleep nine to 12 hours ; infants should sleep 12 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh air into your bedroom by opening a window , if possible .\n\u2022 Consider changing your mattress to one that better suits your body .\n\u2022 Keep your bedroom as dark as possible and fill it with calming items like essential oil diffusers and weighted blankets .\n\u2022 If you wake up in the middle of the night and stay awake for more than 10 minutes , get out of bed and sit somewhere until you feel sleepy .\n\u201c Everyone has some long , hard days , so if you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something for you , that 's not wrong .\nYou \u2019 re just human , \u201d Dasgupta said of screen use before bed .\n\u201c The key is that everything should be done in moderation.\n\u201d And compromises are critical , he added .\nIf you \u2019 re a night owl , try opting for something less engaging than your phone .\nWho knows , maybe you \u2019 ve got more discipline than me and setting screen limits will actually get you to unglue yourself from late-night technology .\nAt least I @ @ @ @ @",

        "content": "Melatonin is famous as the hormone that naturally helps us go to sleep .\nOur bodies usually produce enough to keep us on a normal sleep-wake cycle , but the modern lifestyle of bright screens , late nights , shift work , and time zone\u2013crossing travel leaves many people reaching for over-the-counter melatonin supplements to try to recreate that natural process .\nWhat \u2019 s more , anxiety and sleeplessness caused by the pandemic have had people reaching for melatonin more often too .\nAmericans spent more than $ 1 billion on melatonin in 2021 , a 28 % increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from NielsenIQ .\nAbout 56 % of people said they had COVID-related sleep problems in a 2021 survey conducted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) .\nWhile the natural melatonin produced by the body is best , carefully chosen melatonin supplements may help spur slumber , at least in certain situations .\nHowever , they can have side effects and interact with medications , aren \u2019 t appropriate for all people and circumstances , and need to be taken at the lowest effective dose \u2014 you can definitely take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizziness , nausea , drowsiness , and even elevated blood pressure if you take too much for too long , said Dr. Randall Wright , director of brain wellness and sleep programs at Houston Methodist .\nJust for the record , we \u2019 re also talking about melatonin for adults here .\nMelatonin is not recommended for babies or toddlers , and there are specific guidelines for melatonin use in children .\nThink of melatonin as a key player in your built-in body clock .\nProduced by the brain \u2019 s pineal gland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up and when to sleep , keeping our bodies in sync with the 24-hour day .\n\u201c It works in conjunction with light , \u201d said Dr. Rajkumar Dasgupta , an AASM spokesperson .\n\u201c In the morning , light suppresses the release of melatonin then , at nighttime as the light is going down , melatonin is secreted and hopefully transitions you into some good slumber.\n\u201d That gives sleep a chance to work its magic , rebooting our bodies in preparation for a new 24-hour cycle , Wright said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ use melatonin supplements to address occasional insomnia , which is trouble falling or staying asleep .\nThe scientific evidence , though , isn \u2019 t strong when it comes to using melatonin for that purpose .\nIn one 2020 review of existing studies , melatonin supplements helped people with insomnia but weren \u2019 t as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , which is one of the first treatments you should consider for chronic insomnia .\nCBT involves changing your thoughts and behaviors related to certain issues ( like sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another review , melatonin did seem to help adults 65 or older ( we produce less melatonin as we age ) .\nOverall , though , the AASM has concluded there \u2019 s not enough evidence to support using melatonin for insomnia .\nIf anything , given its short-lasting action , melatonin may help you fall asleep but not necessarily stay asleep , says Dr. Steven H. Feinsilver , director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .\nAnother common use for melatonin supplements is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research does back this up , Feinsilver said .\nIf you want to try melatonin to get your body back on schedule , the AASM recommends starting supplements before you leave on a trip and continuing for a few days after you arrive .\nSmall doses taken before you want to go to sleep should do the trick .\n( More on the correct dosages in a bit . )\nPeople whose days and nights are upside down because they work shifts may also benefit from melatonin supplements .\nA 2014 review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milligrams of melatonin taken after a night shift increased sleep duration by about 24 minutes .\n( The actual dose didn \u2019 t seem to influence the results . )\nHowever , other studies have had mixed results or shown no benefit .\nIf you \u2019 re a shift worker and want to try melatonin , the AASM recommends taking the supplement after getting home in the morning .\nThat way , you won \u2019 t feel drowsy on your drive home .\nScientists have also looked at whether melatonin can help people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s some evidence to suggest that melatonin may benefit people with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder ( DSWPD ) who fall asleep very late and consequently wake up later in the day .\nIt may also have a role to play in helping folks with REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) , which is when patients act out their dreams while sleeping .\nAn estimated 1 % to 2 % of the population has the condition , which affects older people more than younger ones and men more than women .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studies looking at the impact of melatonin on sleep have been small and have only noted relatively modest gains for these conditions , said Dr. Abhinav Singh , medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center .\nIs melatonin safe ?\nYes , melatonin supplements are safe , at least in the short term : There haven \u2019 t been any long-term ( or large-scale ) studies to say whether it \u2019 s safe to take for more than a month or two .\nWhile safe , melatonin still can have side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term use can cause side effects like daytime drowsiness , headaches , and dizziness , according to a 2019 study on adverse events linked to melatonin .\nMelatonin supplements may also interact with certain medications such as blood thinners , anti-seizure drugs as well as diabetes medications and contraceptives .\n\u201c Let your physician know that you \u2019 re taking it , \u201d Dasgupta said .\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldn \u2019 t take melatonin .\nNeither should people with dementia , autoimmune diseases , depression , seizure disorders , diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can interact with many medications used to treat these conditions and could aggravate depression in people with a preexisting condition .\nHow much melatonin should you take ?\nIf you \u2019 re going to try melatonin supplements , Dasgupta recommends starting with a low dose ( about 3 mg ) taken two hours before bedtime , although some people need higher or lower amounts .\nIn many studies , researchers use 2 to 5 mg of melatonin , although it can be as high as 10 mg or more , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amount that \u2019 s closest to a 0.3 mg dose of melatonin , according to the AASM .\nIn general , you can buy melatonin in 1 to 10 mg doses , although it \u2019 s not always easy to know how much you are actually taking .\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn \u2019 t regulate dietary supplements the same way as prescription medications , which means you may not know exactly what amount is in an over-the-counter product , Wright said .\nIn fact , in one study of 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most contained wildly variable amounts of melatonin .\nThe dosage varied from lot to lot and between brands , with some containing almost no melatonin and others having a dose much higher than listed .\n( One type of chewable tablet said it contained 1.5 mg but was in fact 9 mg. ) Many also contained serotonin , a mood-altering hormone that \u2019 s a potentially dangerous controlled substance .\nIf you are taking melatonin , look for products that have been independently tested by US Pharmacopeia ( USP ) , ConsumerLab.com , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure the product actually contains melatonin in the dosage listed on the label .\nOral melatonin can start making you drowsy in 30 to 45 minutes , Singh said .\nThat means you should refrain from driving and avoid doing other things that could be dangerous when you are sleepy .\nIt 's best to limit the amount of time you use melatonin , as it really isn \u2019 t indicated for long-term or chronic use .\n\u201c If you find yourself frequently reaching for a bottle of melatonin to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to speak with a sleep specialist or bring this up with your primary care doctor , \u201d Singh said .\nOther ways to get to sleep without using melatonin If you have trouble falling asleep , doctors generally recommend trying non-drug options first .\nFor instance , dimming your lights and shutting off all electronic screens about two hours before bed will cue your body to produce melatonin , Wright said .\nOther \u201c sleep hygiene \u201d practices should be in place to give melatonin a chance .\nThat means : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercise during the day but not before bed \u2022 Keeping your bedroom dark , quiet , and at a comfortable ( cool ) temperature \u2022 Avoiding caffeine ( and fluids in general ) before bed \u2022 Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day \u2022 Banning screens at least 30 minutes before retiring \u201c Dietary supplements should be part of the broader picture , \u201d Dasgupta said .\n\u201c My instinct is to say that melatonin taken at the right time at the right dose will help individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a very potent sleeping aid ?\nProbably not .\n\u201d",

Marco Rubio , the lead sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make daylight saving time permanent , but this is the first time his legislation has passed the Senate .\nIn a video last week before the US sprung forward , Rubio said , \u201c Switching in and out of Daylight Saving Time is outdated , and it 's only a source of annoyance and confusion .\nFrankly , it 's just dumb , and there 's just no other way to say it.\n\u201d Twenty states , including Florida , have taken steps to stick with daylight saving time year-round , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those to take effect , Rubio said .\nThe bill will allow states to pass their own laws to continue changing their clocks twice per year if they want to stick with the current norm in most of the county ; Arizona and Hawaii don \u2019 t observe daylight saving time at all .\n\u201c No more dark afternoons in the winter .\nNo more losing an hour of sleep every spring .\nWe want more sunshine during our most productive waking hours , \u201d Democratic Sen. Patty Murray , another sponsor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve said it before and I \u2019 ll say it again : Americans want more sunshine and less depression.\n\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Biden supports the bill or would sign it if it comes to his desk .\nThe US first adopted daylight saving time in 1918 .\nThe idea was to add extra sunlight hours in the summer to conserve energy needed to light homes and businesses , though some studies suggest that we \u2019 re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographic .\nAmerica tried making daylight saving time permanent once before \u2014 and then quickly abandoned it .\nThe Nixon administration extended daylight saving hours to the winter in January of 1974 .\nAt the time , a majority of Americans supported the move .\nBut as the winter wore on , the benefit of lighter evenings was undercut by darker mornings .\nSupport dropped and the experiment was not renewed the following winter .\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse , the lead Democratic sponsor of the bill , addressed some of that criticism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that he understood that morning people would lose an hour of daylight .\nBut , he said , the change will give more daylight for kids who are coming home from school to play outside and for people running errands in the early evening .\n\u201c There are a lot fewer people up and about between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning than there are between 4:15 and 5:15 in the afternoon , \u201d he said .\nWhitehouse said he \u2019 d gotten a \u201c very strong response from constituents \u201d in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c hopeful \u201d that the House will pass it as well .\nLast week , a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on the matter where a panel of experts unanimously supported ending the practice of changing clocks twice per year .\nThe problem was they disagreed on whether daylight saving time or standard time should be the permanent solution .\nBeth Malow , a neurology and pediatrics professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , said that making standard time permanent would be the healthiest option .\nShe said exposing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less in the evening cuts back on sleep deprivation .\nConversely , waking up when it is still dark out causes circadian misalignment \u2014 when the sun is not synced to the cycle of your daily life .\nMalow said this increases sleep deprivation , which leads to increased health issues like obesity , depression , ADHD , and cancer .\nShe said the most vulnerable groups are students and people who work early and can \u2019 t control their hours , which tends to be people of lower socioeconomic status .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become alert , to get ourselves going .\nKids need to be alert to go to school , to learn , \u201d Malow said .\nSome industry groups support permanent daylight saving time because lighter evenings are good for the economy \u2014 people feel comfortable being out later in the evening , where they are more likely to spend money .\nUniversity of Washington law professor Steve Calandrillo also made a health and safety argument in favor of permanent daylight saving time .\nCalandrillo told Congress that the evening rush hour period is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to increased traffic , more children playing outside , more alcohol consumed by drivers , and an increased rush to get home .\nExtending daylight to the evening rush hour period would be a big net safety benefit , Calandrillo said , even if it meant the morning rush hour became more dangerous .\nOne Rutgers University study found that permanent daylight saving time could lead to 366 fewer traffic fatalities during the rush hour periods per year .\nCalandrillo also argued that crime would decrease due to the lighter evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets dark .\nAs for the effect on school children waking up and going to school in the dark , Calandrillo proposed a compromise : pair permanent daylight saving time with pushing back the start of school .\nHe said this would help to offset the risks of driving in the morning when it is still dark .\n\u201c We need to be pushing back school times , especially for teenagers , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If we pushed it back we could deal with some of the danger of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight saving time .\n\u201d",

        "content": "When New York \u2019 s attorney general was accused of abusing women , one friend decided that instead of cutting him out of her life , she would try to make him reckon with the harm he inflicted .\nThe experiment they undertook underscores the tantalizing promise \u2014 and the painful limitations \u2014 of moral redemption for men outed by # MeToo .\nEric Schneiderman paced around his prewar Upper West Side apartment in what he would later call a \u201c crazed bunker mentality , \u201d trying to make sense of the past few days .\nAs New York \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero to liberals nationwide for his leading role in the anti-Trump resistance .\nThat changed when the New Yorker reported that multiple women had accused him of physical and emotional abuse .\nWithin hours , Schneiderman learned his longtime rival , then-governor Andrew Cuomo , had ordered a criminal investigation , after which Schneiderman felt compelled to resign .\nSince then he had cloistered himself inside , taking covert house calls from his psychiatrist and hiding from the reporters who camped out in lawn chairs on the street below .\nHis lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements , but privately he obsessed over the injustices he felt he had suffered , from the article , which he thought was unfair , to the political allies who had hastily abandoned him .\nAs Schneiderman stewed in denial and resentment , he got a message from a friend , Anna Graham Hunter , that shook him out of his bitter reverie .\nOn May 7 , 2018 , the day Schneiderman \u2019 s life changed forever , Hunter was sitting at her computer , wrapping up an article for the Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence-breakers \u201d were struggling after coming forward .\nShe was one of them .\n\u201c Why have I been so angry ?\n\u201d she wrote .\n\u201c Shouldn \u2019 t I be feeling better now that my story is out there ?\n\u201d He wasn \u2019 t the only one .\nThroughout her life Hunter had had a variety of upsetting experiences with men , some of which she now categorized as sexual assault .\nOther women could commiserate with her , but it usually concluded with \u201c men are trash , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorphin hit of self-righteousness , those aren \u2019 t fun thoughts to have , and I don \u2019 t know that they ultimately lead to lasting change.\n\u201d Therapists only wanted to talk about childhood trauma , and other men she knew were too defensive to engage .\nHunter wanted to know why all these guys were the way they were .\nShe craved thornier conversations around abuse , sex , and power , but so far she hadn \u2019 t been able to find anyone who wanted to wade into what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Schneiderman would go there with her .\nHunter believed the women who had accused Schneiderman , and she felt deeply conflicted about reaching out to the man who hurt them , but perhaps , she told herself , their dialogue could serve a larger purpose .\nShe figured she couldn \u2019 t be the only one with questions that # MeToo had not been able to resolve \u2014 questions that felt necessary to explore if the movement was to lead to enduring cultural transformation .\nHunter certainly didn \u2019 t think abusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims had any obligation to them whatsoever .\nBut she did wonder if it was ever possible for someone who was capable of such terrible acts to change .\nIt was impossible to know , since almost none of the prominent men outed by # MeToo appeared to have seriously tried .\nWhat would a genuine apology sound like ?\nWhat would constitute true remorse ?\nWas rehabilitation a realistic goal , and , if so , what would that process entail ?\n\u201c Right now I care about the feelings of everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about your feelings , \u201d Hunter wrote to Schneiderman four days later .\n\u201c You have no idea how this has gutted so many , many people , people that I care about and love .\nNo idea .\nThis is by far the worst # MeToo story to come out in many ways.\n\u201d She laid into him for what she saw as sexual entitlement and publicly masked misogyny : \u201c You have some serious fucking reckoning to do.\n\u201d \u201c I will continue to have many ups and downs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote .\n\u201c You 're still my friend , and I still love you , but I am not going to be an easy shoulder for you.\n\u201d \u201c I had to sleep on this one , \u201d Schneiderman wrote Hunter back the next day .\n\u201c I accept the hard shoulder role you are uniquely qualified to play , but it may take a little time before I can fully lean into this conversation .\nYou may not care about my feelings , but I am still reeling from the multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mental state is pretty fragile right now .\nAlthough I go way up and way down .\nI know the path forward includes taking full responsibility for everything I have done , but I am only capable of taking things day by day right now .\nI hope you can understand that , even if you think less of me because of it .\nHaving said all that , this conversation is very important to me .\nI hope we can take it up again when I am better equipped to engage.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ had over the next three and a half years \u2014 on the phone , in emails , over meals , and during long walks through Manhattan \u2019 s Riverside Park \u2014 were at times revelatory .\nThey helped Hunter better understand the harm men had done to her and how it had shaped her .\nAnd they helped Schneiderman understand that he did not deserve to hold a position of power again .\nIt took Hunter a few days to contact him .\n\u201c I went around in torturous loops , \u201d she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any point in spending my energy talking to Eric when I could be supporting women instead.\n\u201d Schneiderman \u2019 s press team had advance notice that the New Yorker was investigating his relationships , but he had told them not to worry \u2014 back then he was so \u201c oblivious , \u201d he said , that he didn \u2019 t feel his personal life would interest a journalist .\nHe knew he had problems : alcoholism , workaholism , maybe even narcissism .\nBut although as attorney general he had pursued high-profile #

MeToo .\nHunter had told Schneiderman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his therapist but impossible to deal with after a meeting with his lawyers .\nSo he devised a code word , \u201c criminal defense loop , \u201d that Hunter could wield whenever Schneiderman started arguing his case , after which they would move on to more productive ground .\nOver those first six months , Schneiderman completed an in-patient alcohol rehabilitation program , committed to sobriety , and started weekly therapy .\nHe had always been drawn to meditation , and he revived his practice and Dharma study , which allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It helped me to be in my body , to get out of my jabbering mind , and to really be able to identify difficult feelings , and instead of running away from them , be able to sit with them , \u201d he said .\nDuring our interviews , he sometimes fingered the 108 Buddhist mala beads he wears on his wrist to remind him \u201c to breathe.\n\u201d He and Hunter also started a \u201c feminist book club , \u201d discussing challenging work by writers from New York magazine \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken Wilber .\nThey read Moira Donegan on why she started the \u201c Shitty Media Men \u201d list and Tarana Burke on # MeToo \u2019 s origin story .\nThey cast a wide net , covering the Black women left out of the suffrage movement , sexual abuse in the Catholic Church , and research on false memories .\nBy approaching these topics intellectually , Schneiderman began to understand \u201c the scope of misogyny and sexism and patriarchy , how it permeated my life , how it permeated our culture , \u201d he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to apply what he was learning to himself .\nIn September , four months after Schneiderman resigned , millions of Americans watched as Christine Blasey Ford testified that she had been sexually assaulted by prospective Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when they were both in high school .\nAs they continued their wide-ranging discussions , Hunter , on edge from the hearings , started to feel that Schneiderman was showing more interest in the possibilities for abusers \u2019 redemption than in victims \u2019 pain .\n\u201c I know that the hardest part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think what I think , \u201d she wrote him in an email .\n\u201c And you want me to understand your experience .\nBut for fuck 's sake , it 's been all about men and their pain and anger for centuries .\nI 'm over it .\nEvery woman I know is over it.\n\u201d \u201c I appreciate your honesty , but what you seem to be saying is that right now you can \u2019 t muster up much in the way of compassion for men , \u201d Schneiderman wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .\nDoes that feel ok ?\nIt sounds like for you it does .\nBut in my experience , you can \u2019 t hear or see someone you have no compassion for , which probably makes any meaningful dialogue impossible.\n\u201d \u201c To have you ask how I feel about not having compassion for men ... just wow , \u201d Hunter wrote back .\n\u201c You may not want to talk to me right now .\nBut what I may have meant is I don \u2019 t want to talk to you.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exhausted by how \u201c the public credibility \u201d of the # MeToo movement \u201c seems to rest on individual stories.\n\u201d The \u201c constant cross examination of every woman \u2019 s account \u201d made it difficult for her to be interested in the nuances of Schneiderman \u2019 s own experiences or care at all about the feelings of men in his position .\n\u201c I \u2019 m terrified that one tiny chink will make the whole thing come tumbling down , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c The Kavanaugh hearings felt like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u2026 I don \u2019 t think you understand the collective experience of women who \u2019 ve been abused by men and had our experiences be invisible for our entire lives until a year ago .\nHow could you ?\n\u201d Schneiderman replied , thanking Hunter for her honesty and conceding that he had been ignoring that collective experience : \u201c Looking at women \u2019 s stories as the tales of individuals with agency ( and who must take responsibility for their own roles in any situation ) misses the overwhelming , crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every situation.\n\u201d At first , Schneiderman felt disgusted by Kavanaugh , who struck him as \u201c the big WASP-y jock \u201d who would have bullied him in school .\nBut in therapy , he had been unpacking his upbringing \u2014 private school in Manhattan , followed by Amherst and Harvard \u2014 and his relationships with his mother and his father , who , like Schneiderman , was a powerful attorney and a \u201c functional alcoholic.\n\u201d When he later read an essay on Kavanaugh \u2019 s privilege , the similarities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharper focus .\nThey both had \u201c benefitted from the American patriarchal structure , \u201d Schneiderman said , and were both brought up to think they could \u201c make the rules and therefore break the rules and prosper.\n\u201d When I asked Hunter why she kept speaking to Schneiderman even when he upset her , she cited dialogues like the one above .\nShe was intrigued by his willingness to be honest with himself \u2014 even if it was a slow and difficult process \u2014 and to keep reading what made him uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really cathartic .\n\u201c I felt like so much of the # MeToo conversation was just women talking to other women and talking about what we wanted to say to men who had done bad things , and now I could actually say it to his face and he had to listen to every word , \u201d Hunter said .\nMeanwhile , Manning Barish and Selvaratnam were writing through their trauma \u2014 Manning Barish on social media , Selvaratnam for the New York Times .\nSelvaratnam began working on a memoir about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrast between Schneiderman \u2019 s actions and his do-gooder persona .\n\u201c His outward-facing spirituality was a mask for the torment beneath the surface , \u201d she later wrote .\n\u201c His outward-facing feminism was a mask for his misogyny.\n\u201d Hunter and Schneiderman were exploring similar themes together .\nWhen they read \u201c The Rub of Rough Sex \u201d by Chelsea Summers \u2014 an essay that focused on Schneiderman himself and considered how progressive men have used \u201c kink as a cover for abuse \u201d \u2014 he felt seen in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The essay \u201c really got me to look at my sexual activity , and say , OK , is there something deeper going on here that I \u2019 m missing ?\n\u201d Schneiderman recalled .\nAfter months of reading and thinking , he said he realized he had sought to control the women in his life and felt entitled to sex not just because of the sexist culture he grew up in but because of the authority that his job conferred .\nEspecially during the Trump years , when he gained national stature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ocean of power and privilege , but I didn \u2019 t even know I was underwater , \u201d Schneiderman told me .\nThe more his star rose , the more arrogant he became .\n\u201c Power creeps up on you , \u201d he said .\nHe came to see that it wasn \u2019 t right to have engaged in what he had thought of as \u201c rough sex \u201d without clear rules in advance , not to mention ongoing communication and trust \u2014 and that he \u201c had consent wrong \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing to them , that meant they were OK with it .\n\u201c While in some senses that may be legal consent , it \u2019 s not ethical consent , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And the ethical consent requires me to make an inquiry into what a partner really wants and really likes .\nAnd I \u2019 m very much ashamed of the fact that I gave that so little thought.\n\u201d In November 2018 , Madeline Singas , then the district attorney who Cuomo had appointed to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to pursue charges against him , citing \u201c legal impediments , \u201d including statutes of limitation .\nIt was a huge relief for Schneiderman .\n\u201c I was able to get out of my \u2018 criminal defense loop , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nThe public statement he put out was very different from his previous denials .\n\u201c I recognize that District Attorney Singas \u2019 decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong , \u201d it said .\n\u201c I accept full responsibility for my conduct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the impact it had on them .\nAfter spending time in a rehab facility , I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed .\nI apologize for any and all pain that I have caused , and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me . ''\nThat recognition was not lost on the women who said Schneiderman had abused them .\nSelvaratnam later wrote that she found the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even further .\n\u201c I feel completely vindicated by Eric Schneiderman \u2019 s admission that he engaged in the abuse to which he subjected me and the other women , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted .\n\u201c I wish him well in his recovery process.\n\u201d In early 2019 , Schneiderman was at lunch with a friend who called # MeToo overreaching and intolerant and questioned whether there was anything men could ever do to appease their accusers .\nActually , Schneiderman told them , Time \u2019 s Up had recently offered simple instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform your behavior .\nMake restitution to those harmed .\n( His friend confirmed this exchange . )\nAfterward , Schneiderman emailed Hunter about the conversation .\n\u201c Oddly enough , I found myself in the role of defending the movement , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c It felt kind of good to be able to lay all of this out .\nAnd I felt somewhat calmer.\n\u201d Along with meditation , Schneiderman had been consulting with his rabbi , J. Rolando Matalon , who told me that there \u2019 s biblical precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAn elaborate priestly ritual described in the Book of Leviticus reintegrated people who had been separated from their community due to contagious skin diseases .\nMatalon thought that , similarly , there could be a ritual that would publicly reintroduce people who had been excluded because of moral offenses if they were able to make amends .\nHowever , Matalon counseled Schneiderman , Judaism makes clear \u201c that a pariah can not return without a serious process of repentance and personal transformation , and directly apologizing to those he has harmed.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction .\nAll she had ever wanted from Hoffman was for him to acknowledge and empathize with his accusers \u2019 claims .\nBut \u201c in the absence of any genuine apology , we were out for vengeance , \u201d she said .\nHunter and Schneiderman looked together for meaningful examples of apologies that sought to actively make things right , not just to individual survivors but to the larger public , but couldn \u2019 t find many .\nOne study of over 200 statements by people accused of sexual misconduct amid the # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included an apology of any kind .\nAnother found that even the highest-quality apologies \u2014 detailed , not defensive \u2014 left the public dissatisfied .\nThere was a single apology that Hunter and Schneiderman found inspiring .\nIn January 2018 , TV writer Dan Harmon apologized on his podcast to his former employee Megan Ganz , saying he realized he lacked respect for women , had hidden behind his progressive politics , and never would have changed his behavior if she hadn \u2019 t accused him publicly on Twitter .\nAfterward , Ganz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schneiderman was nervous he \u2019 d get it wrong .\nAfter he graduated earlier that year from a meditation class in Manhattan , the studio posted a photo of its newly certified students .\nWhen Manning Barish found out , she was outraged .\nSchneiderman was \u201c an untreated sexual assaulter and predator , \u201d she tweeted .\n\u201c He has no business teaching meditation .\nHe has not even been rehabilitated yet.\n\u201d He told me he had no intention of teaching and that the class was for anyone who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the story , and he was banned from the studio .\nThe experience made him feel like it would be easier to stay silent .\n\u201c My male friends often say to me : don \u2019 t even try to apologize , \u201d he once wrote to Hunter in an email .\n\u201c Whatever you say won \u2019 t be enough .\nYou will be attacked all over again and will have admitted to wrongdoing.\n\u201d Hunter encouraged Schneiderman to push past his anxieties \u2014 if he had apologized earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing progress , maybe the meditation class incident would never have happened .\nIn February , she suggested he start with Selvaratnam .\nThe night before , Hunter and Schneiderman had discussed Selvaratnam \u2019 s New York Times article , in which she said he had \u201c tested \u201d her by giving her little slaps .\n\u201c I have never heard you understand Tanya \u2019 s point of view like you did last night , \u201d Hunter wrote to him .\n\u201c How it \u2019 s a slippery slope of giving in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for the sake of staying with someone.\n\u201d \u201c I am now clear : I am very , very sorry for my appalling conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote in a draft version .\n\u201c I have a lot more work to do and amends to make , but I felt that it was important to reach out as a work in progress and to tell you that I am sorry.\n\u201d It was brutally hard to face up to what he had done , he wrote , and for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what he did with any clarity .\n\u201c None of this excuses my conduct towards you , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c From the beginning , I bossed you around .\nMaybe lightheartedly at first , but over time , I became less and less considerate and more and more nasty and controlling .\nAnd I pushed you to go along with things in bed that I now recognize you did not want to do.\n\u201d He never asked her whether their relationship worked for her , he wrote .\nInstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deeply ashamed .\n\u201c I have a long way to go , but I am committed to doing the work I need to do to become a better , healthier human being , and to ensure that I never behave the way I did with you with anyone else ever again , \u201d he wrote .\nHunter was overcome after she read the draft .\n\u201c I think I \u2019 ve been honest about how emotional this is for me \u2014 that the weight I \u2019 m putting on this apology goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote to him .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not saying that \u2019 s right or healthy , but I haven \u2019 t spent the last 10 months talking to you so intensely just because you \u2019 re my friend and I care about you \u2026 Having you get to the point where you could even write a letter like this is all I have wanted since we started talking .\nFor you to GET IT .\nAs I said ... in many ways you \u2019 re a stand-in for all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , because they won \u2019 t even try.\n\u201d Schneiderman never sent the letter .\nShortly after he drafted it , he learned that a state committee that investigates wrongdoing by Manhattan attorneys was conducting a probe into the allegations against him .\nIf the First Department appellate court found him responsible , he could be suspended or disbarred from practicing law .\nThat wasn \u2019 t a consequence Schneiderman was willing to accept .\nHe shelved his apology plans , convinced that if he reached out to the women it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lawyered up again , reentering the \u201c criminal defense loop \u201d he had worked so hard to overcome .\nRecords show that his attorney \u2019 s response to the committee did not reflect Schneiderman \u2019 s newfound understanding of consent .\nInstead , it reiterated his old arguments , protesting that his \u201c consensual relationships with his romantic partners in the confines of his bedroom \u201d should not be subject to further scrutiny .\nWhen Schneiderman was deposed for the investigation in January 2020 , he said Manning Barish and Selvaratnam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c dominant-submissive \u201d sex life , according to the committee records .\n\u201c I \u2019 m confident that neither one of them ever after sex or the next morning said \u2018 I don \u2019 t like what you did , don \u2019 t do that anymore \u2019 or any words to that effect , \u201d he said .\nAll those emails and texts that Schneiderman had worked hard not to dwell on were deployed in an attempt to discredit the women .\nHe said in his deposition that , contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her life , she had fought to stay together when he broke things off , \u201c devastated \u201d to lose him not \u201c just as a romantic partner but as a teammate for her career.\n\u201d He argued that the New Yorker was wrong that the anonymous woman in the Hamptons rebuffed him after he slapped her , and that the magazine had failed to report that they had stayed in \u201c warm and flirtatious \u201d touch afterward .\nAs for Manning Barish , the records cited emails from her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him she loved him , missed him , and wanted to marry him .\nReferencing allegations that former New York governor Eliot Spitzer had choked a woman , she said she felt sorry he hadn \u2019 t met the right girl yet .\n\u201c Too soon for you to give him my number ?\n\u201d she quipped .\nUntil Schneiderman , \u201c no one ever understood my darkness , \u201d she wrote to him .\n\u201c I miss that part of me being controlled and celebrated.\n\u201d In his deposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrite statement he had released after the DA declined to prosecute .\nFor the women who said he \u2019 d abused them , that statement had been validating and vindicating .\nFor Schneiderman himself , it had represented crucial progress forward on his path toward self-improvement .\nBut it was the committee \u2019 s job to assess whether he had committed professional misconduct and should be disciplined , not to ensure the women got what they needed to heal .\nAnd to the committee lawyer , it seemed , that statement was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf his relationships with the women were as \u201c vibrant and consensual \u201d as he had just described , the lawyer asked , \u201c for what were you apologizing ?\n\u201d Hunter grew frustrated as she watched from the sidelines .\nShe still held out hope that one day Schneiderman would make full amends to the women , and that they would get the reckoning she herself had never received .\n\u201c \u200b\u200bI was vengeful \u201d toward Hoffman , \u201c but mostly I wanted all of us to stop hurting so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the adversarial legal proceeding made that hope an increasingly distant possibility .\nExperts in restorative justice insist there is a better approach in these types of situations .\nWhether administered through the legal system or outside of it , restorative justice is at its heart a community-based process that seeks to honor the needs of those hurt and ensure accountability for those who caused them harm , instead of asking who broke the law and how they should be penalized .\n\u201c It can be difficult to come to the realization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished in order for you to heal , \u201d said Sonya Shah , a restorative justice practitioner who is also a sexual assault survivor .\nThe practitioners who spoke with me said restorative justice , which is inspired by the conflict-resolution practices of some Indigenous cultures , is most crucial for people in marginalized communities .\nThey are the ones who face disproportionate punishment in the justice system , not privileged white men ( or in Schneiderman \u2019 s case , a privileged white former law enforcement officer ) .\nBut some restorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a closer look at # MeToo .\nThey said they understood the valid anger the movement unleashed , but that harsher retribution wasn \u2019 t the answer .\nResearch has shown prison does not effectively rehabilitate offenders , and the criminal justice system can retraumatize and disempower survivors , who often say they want their assailant to change but not to be locked up .\nMost sexual assault and harassment claims are never even referred for prosecution \u2014 which is more evidence that other options are needed , experts said .\nFiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it doesn \u2019 t necessarily prevent them from getting another job where they hurt more people .\nPublic shaming can spread awareness , but on its own it provides no road map for ending the cycles of harm , experts said , especially since plenty of the most high-profile # MeToo men seem like they \u2019 re doing just fine and have no regrets other than getting called out .\nPractitioners said restorative justice doesn \u2019 t let offenders off easy \u2014 in order to participate in the process , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept responsibility \u2014 and that it always centers survivors \u2019 needs .\nIt also allows the parties to make progress even if they don \u2019 t agree on all of the facts .\nShah said she has counseled men who committed sexual assault who were willing to apologize for some but not all of what they were accused of , and she has worked with survivors who felt that a partial apology could still be beneficial .\n\u201c We come down so hard on people when they cause harm that they learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is to remain silent , defend themselves , and admit nothing , \u201d said Erika Sasson , a former litigator and long-standing restorative justice practitioner .\nThis fundamental right to a defense is important in court , she said , but it makes it harder for people to be honest with each other and break the silence and secrecy of abuse .\nTelling the truth , she said , takes \u201c courage , communication , and support.\n\u201d In April 2021 , the First Department appellate court issued its ruling : Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , conditioned upon continuing therapy and supervision .\nThe decision included a statement of facts that didn \u2019 t substantiate all of the claims against him , but Schneiderman admitted that he had slapped Selvaratnam and Manning Barish and placed his hands on their necks and applied pressure without first obtaining consent .\nHe also admitted to emotionally abusing them , and to slapping the anonymous woman from the Hamptons twice .\nThese avowals , however , were part of a legal settlement that didn \u2019 t seem to fully satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women learned that Schneiderman had tried to protect himself by blaming them .\nThe validation they expressed after his earlier statement of remorse was demolished .\n\u201c I initially chose not to participate in this after having to keep testifying over and over again , \u201d Manning Barish tweeted after the decision .\n\u201c But they went after Eric anyway , and he chose to compose a complete lie of a narrative to defend himself , and discredit me .\nSo I fought back.\n\u201d Schneiderman , she wrote , \u201c belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her book about Schneiderman at the time , and she spoke about how she believed in redemption if an abuser \u201c acknowledges the harm that they have committed and does the hard work to root out their abusive behavior.\n\u201d But the one-year suspension was \u201c not enough \u201d to reform Schneiderman , she said .\nThough they were not in contact , she was confident he hadn \u2019 t changed , because she had heard from other professed victims of his , including someone who said he abused her after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selvaratnam \u2019 s book , her evidence for that claim was an email she received from a woman who said Schneiderman was a \u201c sadist and predator \u201d who had \u201c targeted \u201d her .\nShe didn \u2019 t include more details .\nSelvaratnam acknowledged that she did not speak to the woman and couldn \u2019 t \u201c vouch for her experience.\n\u201d Still , the note felt like \u201c an affirmation.\n\u201d \u201c It also sparked the first time I felt rage toward Eric , \u201d she wrote .\nWhen I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allegation and said he hadn \u2019 t been romantically involved with a woman since May 2018 .\nHe said Selvaratnam didn \u2019 t reach out to him before publishing her book or before repeating the claim to the press .\nAfter the ruling , the anonymous Hamptons woman identified herself as Danya Perry , a prominent attorney who used to work for the Southern District of New York .\nPerry told me she was horrified and distraught when Schneiderman slapped her during a romantic encounter after a party , and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterward , she said , it seemed like Schneiderman had genuinely misread the situation .\nHe told her he had dated other women who enjoyed being slapped , and she believed him when he said he had made a drunken mistake .\nBut when Perry heard that journalists were looking into a possible pattern , she decided to tell them about her experience .\nShe wasn \u2019 t interested in prosecuting Schneiderman , and at first she didn \u2019 t want any role in the committee proceeding either .\nLosing his job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learned that he had defended himself by minimizing the fact that he slapped her and exaggerating her forgiveness .\n\u201c If he had acknowledged and apologized , I would have said , Why do we need to punish this guy anymore ?\n\u201d she told me .\nPerry decided to cooperate .\nI also reached out to Jess McIntosh , who in 2018 wrote an essay for Elle about going on an unsettling date with Schneiderman in the early 2000s .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t care what happens to Eric Schneiderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have any power over the women of New York anymore , \u201d McIntosh said .\n\u201c I very much care about taking away power from people who don \u2019 t treat women as human beings and are somehow surprised that acting physically violent is wrong.\n\u201d She was skeptical and unimpressed when I told her about his conversations with Hunter .\n\u201c I hope he stays woke , \u201d she said , \u201c and I hope he stays quiet.\n\u201d None of the women who spoke out in 2018 seemed satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists .\nThe criminal justice system couldn \u2019 t address his harm .\nThe committee decision didn \u2019 t appease them , and in some ways the process seemed to make matters worse .\nPublic awareness pushed Schneiderman out of power but hasn \u2019 t held him accountable for whatever he has or hasn \u2019 t done since .\nOver the last four years , post- # MeToo efforts toward systemic progress have delivered mixed results .\nLawmakers have introduced a wave of carceral bills that some experts say will do more harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed by # MeToo have been replaced by women in the workplace \u2014 for example , Letitia James holds Schneiderman \u2019 s former position \u2014 but many others have scored new jobs and been nominated for fancy awards .\nMeanwhile , Time \u2019 s Up , the prominent anti-harassment charity that was supposed to tackle structural # MeToo issues , fell into crisis because of its ties to Cuomo .\nThere has been scant funding or research to determine how restorative justice might address these issues on a larger scale , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act has a proposal set aside for restorative practices .\nAlthough it \u2019 s been nearly three years since Schneiderman said he knew his path forward included amends and restitution , he still has yet to directly apologize to Selvaratnam , Manning Barish , or Perry .\nAs for restitution , he said , he plans on asking them for their input at some point in the future .\nHe hasn \u2019 t yet donated any of his own money for that purpose \u2014 \u201c I \u2019 ve been unemployed for three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of prospects , \u201d he said \u2014 but he has donated millions to charity from his old campaign fund , which he can only legally withdraw from for a few purposes .\n( He also returned money to donors who asked for it back and used some to cover his legal fees . )\nSelvaratnam has written that she thought it wrong of him to launder his reputation with charitable donations , while Manning Barish recently posted online that she thought it was disgusting he hadn \u2019 t donated more .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer for progressive causes .\nBefore his license was suspended , he reached out to a number of groups , but no one wanted to be publicly associated with him , he said , not even a nonprofit that works with formerly incarcerated people who have committed murder and rape .\nEventually he realized that if he swore never to disclose his participation \u2014 if he \u201c worked like a blacklisted screenwriter in the 1950s \u201d \u2014 he could do interesting and useful work , such as advising organizations on legal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soup kitchen through his synagogue .\nRabbi Matalon told me that egoless community service is an important part of repentance : \u201c Atonement requires humility.\n\u201d Schneiderman insisted that his journey is ongoing and that he has already made meaningful amends to some people in his life .\nHe repeatedly said that he still hopes to do so to the women who participated in the committee investigation , but he can \u2019 t consider it until he gets his law license back \u2014 which could take a while , since he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up \u2014 lest he seem to be interfering in the legal process , since there might a hearing where the women could be called to testify .\nThere \u2019 s another factor , too .\nHe wouldn \u2019 t speak about the details of his sobriety , but in many programs , such as Alcoholics Anonymous , making amends is a step that comes later on , after committing a \u201c searching and fearless moral inventory \u201d of oneself .\nBut neither reason explains why he agreed to give me the draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or why he wouldn \u2019 t reach out to Perry even after I shared what she told me about her willingness to engage .\nDoes he deserve more patience and support , or is he a lost cause who , despite all claims to the contrary , cares only about restoring his public image ?\nIn the absence of any formalized process that might thoroughly hold Schneiderman accountable , he \u2019 s decided to try his luck in the court of public opinion , leaving it up to the readers of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .\n\u201c I \u2019 m trying to do the next right thing every day , \u201d Schneiderman said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m still working on fully understanding the consequences of my conduct.\n\u201d He added , \u201c I \u2019 ve come to understand that the process I \u2019 m in now requires me to take some time before making certain amends , and I \u2019 m respecting that process and trying to do it the right way.\n\u201d Part of her is afraid to go public with their friendship because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s an enabler or betraying the movement .\nWhen I saw them both recently and asked Schneiderman to triple-confirm he would never run for office again , which he did , she quipped to him , \u201c If you did , I wouldn \u2019 t be your friend , \u201d and then followed up with me to say that she was serious and hoped I \u2019 d include that in the story : \u201c Running for office again would be the worst possible move for a recovering narcissist !\n\u201d There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .\n\u201c How do we make men care ?\n\u201d she asked me one day .\n\u201c Does a fear of being disgraced have to be part of the incentive ?\n\u201d But as long as Schneiderman keeps digging into his past and trying to make things right for the future \u2014 and as long as their exchanges continue to fascinate and challenge her \u2014 she \u2019 ll take walks and share meals with him , continuing their conversations about sex , power , and abuse .\nHunter always felt that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Schneiderman for her own benefit as much as for his .\nBut in August 2021 , Hunter read a New York magazine article about a form of restorative justice called \u201c surrogate dialogue \u201d in which survivors work through their trauma not with their own assailant but with someone else who committed similar offenses .\nHunter was shocked to realize that she and Schneiderman had , in their own unsupervised , extremely ad hoc way , been engaging in a version of that .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate that word , \u201d Hunter said .\n\u201c But having this extended conversation with Eric over three years where I have seen him deepen his own understanding and also deepen mine in a way , has \u2014 in the absence of any genuine reckoning or apology I \u2019 m going to get from any man who has hurt me \u2014 been the next best thing.\n\u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "Melatonin is famous as the hormone that naturally helps us go to sleep .\nOur bodies usually produce enough to keep us on a normal sleep-wake cycle , but the modern lifestyle of bright screens , late nights , shift work , and time zone\u2013crossing travel leaves many people reaching for over-the-counter melatonin supplements to try to re-create that natural process .\nWhat \u2019 s more , anxiety and sleeplessness caused by the pandemic have had people reaching for melatonin more often too .\nAmericans spent more than $ 1 billion on melatonin in 2021 , a 28 % increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from NielsenIQ .\nAbout 56 % of people said they had COVID-related sleep problems in a 2021 survey conducted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) .\nWhile the natural melatonin produced by the body is best , carefully chosen melatonin supplements may help spur slumber , at least in certain situations .\nHowever , they can have side effects and interact with medications , aren \u2019 t appropriate for all people and circumstances , and need to be taken at the lowest effective dose \u2014 you can definitely take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizziness , nausea , drowsiness , and even elevated blood pressure if you take too much for too long , said Dr. Randall Wright , director of brain wellness and sleep programs at Houston Methodist .\nJust for the record , we \u2019 re also talking about melatonin for adults here .\nMelatonin is not recommended for babies or toddlers , and there are specific guidelines for melatonin use in children .\nThink of melatonin as a key player in your built-in body clock .\nProduced by the brain \u2019 s pineal gland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up and when to sleep , keeping our bodies in sync with the 24-hour day .\n\u201c It works in conjunction with light , \u201d said Dr. Rajkumar Dasgupta , an AASM spokesperson .\n\u201c In the morning , light suppresses the release of melatonin then , at nighttime as the light is going down , melatonin is secreted and hopefully transitions you into some good slumber.\n\u201d That gives sleep a chance to work its magic , rebooting our bodies in preparation for a new 24-hour cycle , Wright said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ use melatonin supplements to address occasional insomnia , which is trouble falling or staying asleep .\nThe scientific evidence , though , isn \u2019 t strong when it comes to using melatonin for that purpose .\nIn one 2020 review of existing studies , melatonin supplements helped people with insomnia but weren \u2019 t as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , which is one of the first treatments you should consider for chronic insomnia .\nCBT involves changing your thoughts and behaviors related to certain issues ( like sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another review , melatonin did seem to help adults 65 or older ( we produce less melatonin as we age ) .\nOverall , though , the AASM has concluded there \u2019 s not enough evidence to support using melatonin for insomnia .\nIf anything , given its short-lasting action , melatonin may help you fall asleep but not necessarily stay asleep , says Dr. Steven H. Feinsilver , director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .\nAnother common use for melatonin supplements is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research does back this up , Feinsilver said .\nIf you want to try melatonin to get your body back on schedule , the AASM recommends starting supplements before you leave on a trip and continuing for a few days after you arrive .\nSmall doses taken before you want to go to sleep should do the trick .\n( More on the correct dosages in a bit . )\nPeople whose days and nights are upside down because they work varying shifts may also benefit from melatonin supplements .\nA 2014 review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 milligrams of melatonin taken after a night shift increased sleep duration by about 24 minutes .\n( The actual dose didn \u2019 t seem to influence the results . )\nHowever , other studies have had mixed results or shown no benefit .\nIf you \u2019 re a shift worker and want to try melatonin , the AASM recommends taking the supplement after getting home in the morning .\nThat way , you won \u2019 t feel drowsy on your drive home .\nScientists have also looked at whether melatonin can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s some evidence to suggest that melatonin may benefit people with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder ( DSWPD ) who fall asleep very late and consequently wake up later in the day .\nIt may also have a role to play in helping folks with REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) , which is when patients act out their dreams while sleeping .\nAn estimated 1 % to 2 % of the population has the condition , which affects older people more than younger ones and men more than women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the studies looking at the impact of melatonin on sleep have been small and have only noted relatively modest gains for these conditions , said Dr. Abhinav Singh , medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center .\nIs melatonin safe ?\nYes , melatonin supplements are safe , at least in the short term : There haven \u2019 t been any long-term ( or large-scale ) studies to say whether it \u2019 s safe to take for more than a month or two .\nWhile safe , melatonin still can have side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even short-term use can cause side effects like daytime drowsiness , headaches , and dizziness , according to a 2019 study on adverse events linked to melatonin .\nMelatonin supplements may also interact with certain medications such as blood thinners , anti-seizure drugs , diabetes medications , and contraceptives .\n\u201c Let your physician know that you \u2019 re taking it , \u201d Dasgupta said .\nPeople who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldn \u2019 t take melatonin .\nNeither should people with dementia , autoimmune diseases , depression , seizure disorders , diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can interact with many medications used to treat these conditions and could aggravate depression in people with a preexisting condition .\nHow much melatonin should you take ?\nIf you \u2019 re going to try melatonin supplements , Dasgupta recommends starting with a low dose ( about 3 mg ) taken two hours before bedtime , although some people need higher or lower amounts .\nIn many studies , researchers use 2 to 5 mg of melatonin , although it can be as high as 10 mg or more , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amount that \u2019 s closest to a 0.3 mg dose of melatonin , according to the AASM .\nIn general , you can buy melatonin in 1 to 10 mg doses , although it \u2019 s not always easy to know how much you are actually taking .\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn \u2019 t regulate dietary supplements the same way as prescription medications , which means you may not know exactly what amount is in an over-the-counter product , Wright said .\nIn fact , in one study of 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most contained wildly variable amounts of melatonin .\nThe dosage varied from lot to lot and between brands , with some containing almost no melatonin and others having a dose much higher than listed .\n( One type of chewable tablet said it contained 1.5 mg but was in fact 9 mg. ) Many also contained serotonin , a mood-altering hormone that \u2019 s a potentially dangerous controlled substance .\nIf you are taking melatonin , look for products that have been independently tested by US Pharmacopeia ( USP ) , ConsumerLab.com , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure the product actually contains melatonin in the dosage listed on the label .\nOral melatonin can start making you drowsy in 30 to 45 minutes , Singh said .\nThat means you should refrain from driving and avoid doing other things that could be dangerous when you are sleepy .\nIt 's best to limit the amount of time you use melatonin , as it really isn \u2019 t indicated for long-term or chronic use .\n\u201c If you find yourself frequently reaching for a bottle of melatonin to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to speak with a sleep specialist or bring this up with your primary care doctor , \u201d Singh said .\nOther ways to get to sleep without using melatonin If you have trouble falling asleep , doctors generally recommend trying nondrug options first .\nFor instance , dimming your lights and shutting off all electronic screens about two hours before bed will cue your body to produce melatonin , Wright said .\nOther \u201c sleep hygiene \u201d practices should be in place to give melatonin a chance .\nThat means : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercise during the day but not before bed \u2022 Keeping your bedroom dark , quiet , and at a comfortable ( cool ) temperature \u2022 Avoiding caffeine ( and fluids in general ) before bed \u2022 Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day \u2022 Banning screens at least 30 minutes before retiring \u201c Dietary supplements should be part of the broader picture , \u201d Dasgupta said .\n\u201c My instinct is to say that melatonin taken at the right time at the right dose will help individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a very potent sleeping aid ?\nProbably not .\n\u201d",

        "content": "If you call up Republican officials in Iowa and New Hampshire , one potential 2024 presidential candidate 's name comes up again and again : Tom Cotton .\nPoliticians are expected to parade through the early states well ahead of 2024 , and many Republicans are , even with the looming possibility that former president Donald Trump will run again .\nBut few have been the fixture that is Cotton , the Arkansas senator , party officials say .\nHe 's already attending county Christmas parties and local pastimes .\nEarlier this year , he zoomed into the New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his support for the state 's first-in-the-the-nation primary status , promising yet another visit .\n\u201c He has really been pounding the pavement , \u201d New Hampshire committee member Juliana Bergeron told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview .\n\u201c And honestly , I joked that \u2018 I was beginning to think he lived here.\n\u2019 But he doesn't.\n\u201d Iowa state party chair Jeff Kaufmann told BuzzFeed News , \u201c Tom Cotton not only has been to the state multiple times , he 's very strategic in where he 's going .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to appear on the Missouri River .\nHe 's made a point to appear on the Mississippi .\nHe 's made a point to go to Northern Iowa . ''\nLast summer , Cotton stopped into the Third Annual Machine Gun Shoot in Hillsborough , New Hampshire , to fire off a few rounds .\nHe was a speaker at a tailgate event at the University of Iowa a couple of months later .\nAnd in December , he gifted VIP attendees of the Cheshire County Christmas Party copies of his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Lane , the state committee \u2019 s secretary , said there were concerns he wouldn \u2019 t attract people to the event since he \u2019 d visited the state so often .\n\u201c But it turns out he was a good draw , \u201d she said .\n\u201c He \u2019 s much more personable than he comes across on TV , \u201d Lane said .\n\u201c And I was really impressed with his handshake .\nYou can tell a lot by these people how they shake your hand.\n\u201d Cotton , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is just one of many potential 2024 candidates who \u2019 ve traveled to the early states in recent months : Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo attended a fundraiser in Iowa Friday .\nFormer vice president Mike Pence , Sen. Rick Scott , Sen. Tim Scott , South Dakota Gov .\nKristi Noem , Sen. Ted Cruz , and Nikki Haley , the former UN ambassador , have all made preliminary rounds .\nAnd despite Cotton \u2019 s early outreach , he has not performed well in public polling so far .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ % in Echelon insights and McLaughlin & Associates surveys , in company with Sen. Mitt Romney and Rep. Liz Cheney .\nLast month , Cotton tied with Sen. Marco Rubio and Ben Carson in the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll with just .03 % .\nCotton is trying to build a national case as a law-and-order , tough-on-defense candidate \u2014 clearly on display in his recent and very intense speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library .\nThere , he put forth Andrew Jackson as a standard bearer , railed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes from American history , argued for \u201c restoring patriotic education \u201d by ending critical race theory , and lobbied for ending trade concessions to China and remaining tough on Vladimir Putin .\nIn the speech , he especially criticized the First Step Act , the Trump-era bipartisan criminal justice law that changed some sentencing rules , calling it the \u201c worst mistake of \u201d Trump \u2019 s tenure .\nCotton called for ending the \u201c carnage \u201d of crime and made an extended allusion to Jackson .\n\u201c Here we can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Cotton said in the speech .\n\u201c In 1818 , criminals and marauders used lawless portions of Spanish Florida as bases to attack and kill American citizens .\nIn response , General Jackson invaded Spanish territory , rooted out those responsible , and then conquered the Spanish capital just for good measure .\nWe should show the same resolve in the face of crime and lawlessness today.\n\u201d How to handle crime and the criminal justice system has divided Republicans in recent years : The 2020 Republican convention featured both people whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about needing to get tough on crime and invoking the kinds of metaphors Cotton used .\nDoug Collins , a former Republican member of Congress who helped steer the legislation , defended the First Step Act this week , saying that the law focused on \u201c preparing men and women to come back into society \u201d and reducing recidivism , rather than having to do with the uptick in crime .\n\u201c I think it 's Tom Cotton being Tom Cotton .\nHe 's never agreed with this plan , \u201d Collins said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure why you would be against that , and especially when Donald Trump showed that it actually helped people .\nIt \u2019 s an easy attack from a conservative position , but without taking into account the realities of what 's happening.\n\u201d The overall case Cotton made last week , though , largely embraces the themes Trump ran on in 2016 when he upended Republican politics .\nIf Trump doesn \u2019 t run again , the field may actually be wide open .\nAnd Iowa and New Hampshire are states with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time .\nThe last two Republican Iowa caucus winners \u2014 Cruz and former senator Rick Santorum \u2014 spent months and months in the state .\n`` In Iowa , people appreciate not only coming to the state ; often , they appreciate making an effort to come to every corner of the state , '' Kaufmann said .\nBefore the 2008 primary , John McCain debarked a plane in Manchester , New Hampshire , \u201c with a suitcase in hand , no aides , no money , \u201d the state \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the rounds to about 400 of the state \u2019 s town halls before eventually securing the Republican nomination .\n\u201c We have to meet somebody four or five times before we make a decision of whether we support him for president or not , \u201d Lane said .",

        "content": "Two-thirds of the way through his claustrophobic 2021 comedy special Inside , Bo Burnham briefly strips away all the humor and launches into \u201c That Funny Feeling.\n\u201d It \u2019 s an intimate , quiet song that draws its power from its lyrical conceit .\nHis verses are constructed of modern contradictions ( \u201c stunning 8K resolution meditation app \u201d ) and phrases that at face value are absurd ( \u201c the live-action Lion King \u201d ) , while the chorus once again contends with the titular feeling .\nExcept Burnham does not name the feeling .\nInstead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off .\nThe song doesn \u2019 t work if the idea of a \u201c stunning 8K resolution meditation app \u201d doesn \u2019 t arouse something similar in you , too .\nIt \u2019 s vaguely dystopian , disoriented , unmoored .\nBurnham and I are roughly the same age .\nI was 1 when the Berlin Wall fell .\nI was 3 by the time the Soviet Union collapsed .\nBurnham and I are in the middle range of millennials , a generation born into the longest period of global American supremacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this stretch .\nIn the West , it \u2019 s been understood as an era of stability ; in the early 1990s , one political scientist even suggested we \u2019 ve arrived at the \u201c end of history , \u201d an argument that , following the triumph of Western liberal democracies over other arrangements of governments , there would be no going back .\nAnd so it was for most of my life that history has been over .\nThe general edicts of the rules-based order and liberal society have applied .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ US became the central axis around which the world spun .\nAmerican wars no longer had specific ideological enemies ; instead , they were fought against concepts \u2014 public opinion was mobilized to engage in a war on \u201c terror.\n\u201d Two years before I was born , in the spring of 1986 , German sociologist Ulrich Beck published the book Risk Society .\nBeck \u2019 s ambitions were high .\nHe was grasping for a unifying theory , trying to name an ethos of anxiety and uncertainty , a pervasive vagueness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preface , he declares that he takes issue with the \u201c post- \u201d prefix ; at the time , everything was \u201c post- \u201d \u2014 postwar , postindustrial , postmodern , postcolonial .\nBeck was unsatisfied with that frame because \u201c post- \u201d is a negative definition .\nIt defines what something is not .\nThat we are \u201c postmodern \u201d tells you very little about what has replaced modernity .\nBeck argued that we were actually in a \u201c risk \u201d society \u2014 a very cool , not-at-all-alarming name \u2014 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global , anonymous , invisible threats .\nBut Beck didn \u2019 t stop at naming it \u2014 he offered a way forward : a framework for how to live in a risk society .\nHis fundamental question : \u201c How can we cope with the fear , if we can not overcome the causes of the fear ?\nHow can we live on the volcano of civilization without deliberately forgetting about it , but also without suffocating on the fears \u2014 and not just on the vapors that the volcano exudes ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volcano .\nTwo years after the start of a global pandemic that has killed millions around the world and nearly a million in the US and upended the lives of everyone on the planet , we find ourselves at a crossroads at every level of our lives .\nOn a personal level , our friendships have been reordered .\nOn a national level , technology has accelerated a complete breakdown in trust of institutions that once served to keep us together .\nGlobally , a war in Ukraine has exposed the fragility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collective reluctant action to fight the climate crisis has deepened instability and thrown into doubt the idea that we can avoid dire consequences .\nWe are undergoing a colossal vibe shift that extends beyond taste , aesthetics , politics , fashion , or policy .\nThe world as we knew it is not coming back , and it \u2019 s entirely reasonable that we may find ourselves plagued with a general restlessness , a vague notion of disorder .\nIt \u2019 s that funny feeling .\nThey may have been days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the pandemic were also a time of togetherness .\nThis went beyond a performative online unity .\nThere was a general sense that we were all vulnerable to a virus we still knew little about .\nGlobal economic machinery , for the most part , had ground to a halt .\nCity streets were empty , save for the essential workers in hospitals , grocery stores , and other services required for survival .\nTo let them know we appreciated the risk they were taking , many of us gathered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang on pots and pans as a chaotic expression of gratitude .\nOn social media and in news articles , experts told us to take care of ourselves , to check on each other , and not to let the social bonds fray .\nPeople held \u201c Zoom parties \u201d as a consolatory replacement for the real thing .\nWe may be apart , we declared , but we \u2019 ll find a way back to each other .\nBeloved musicians asked for patience and promised , \u201c There will be light after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t 6 feet apart.\n\u201d Actors , uh , tried to reassure us .\nBut as the pandemic wore on , and waves crested and waned , a new set of politics started to emerge : the politics of risk .\nMany of us found ourselves gravitating toward friends who shared the same risk tolerance as us .\nAlliances formed based on how willing people were to spend time with each other IRL or how willing they were to maintain a digital relationship .\nFriendships weakened over differing ideas of what constitutes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn a deeper level , the pandemic has introduced an elevated tenor of personal politics .\nIn this way , the pandemic enlarged politics , making it the most immediate thing about relationships .\nThis process , which was certainly underway long before COVID \u2014 quite visibly so during the Trump presidency \u2014 has become even more acute as a willingness to follow health requirements became a kind of litmus test for friendship eligibility .\nOn the one hand , it \u2019 s a deeply cynical , destructive , and indeed existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people bought it .\nThe good news is that Trump is not currently president .\nThe bad news is that on his way out , he dealt a near-fatal blow to those institutions when he encouraged supporters to \u201c fight like hell \u201d and march on the Capitol .\nSure , the system held up and rebuffed Trump \u2019 s play .\nBut the cost was deep disarray , a rattled political realm that has not yet fully contended with the image of one president tarnishing the system .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding a dangerous precedent is one of the most destabilizing things you can do .\nAnd who knows who will be compelled to push the precedent further next time ?\nThe more immediate question for American democracy is : Why did more people vote for Donald Trump in 2020 than in 2016 ?\nSurely they didn \u2019 t miss the news cycle of his entire presidency .\nIt \u2019 s impossible to have missed him systematically subverting the institutions that governments rely on .\nSo could it be that they bought the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nDid his presidency confirm something about decay in general social trust ?\nConsider the Edelman Trust Barometer .\nThe public relations firm has been conducting an annual global survey measuring public confidence in institutions since 2000 .\nIts 2022 report , which found that distrust is now \u201c society \u2019 s default emotion , \u201d recorded a trend of collapsing faith in institutions such as government or media .\nThough it \u2019 s easy to be dismissive of Trump \u2019 s crass nihilist threat , it \u2019 s far harder to contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed .\nAfter decades of letting inequality worsen , those with their hands on the levers of American democracy suddenly found the will and drive to send thousands of dollars into the bank accounts of every American .\nUS households grew their wealth by $ 13.5 trillion in 2020 thanks in part to generous government spending to keep the economy afloat .\nThis may solve one big problem \u2014 how people were supposed to pay their rent and mortgages while work was closed \u2014 but it introduced a new one : Wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this any time it wanted ?\nSoon it became clear that even the wealth gains of the pandemic were not equal .\nBecause of an unexpected stock market boom , \u200b\u200bmore than 70 % of the increase in household wealth went to the top 20 % of income earners .\nGenerally , workers with higher incomes saw their lot improve due to the sweeping economic changes of COVID .\nMeanwhile , temporary pandemic aid programs helped reduce child poverty in the US before they were pulled back in late 2021 .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even \u2014 to conclude that successive American governments have not considered widening income inequality to be an urgent problem .\nIt \u2019 s rational to conclude that successive American governments have been asleep at the wheel , content with general economic growth while not paying attention to where that growth was going .\nThat we have social language for this is a meaningful success of the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011 .\nIts physical impact may have been short , but its rhetorical one is a reimagination of the public language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 99 percent \u2014 and by every imaginable metric , the lives of the 1 percent have been getting better , even during a global pandemic .\nIndeed , the richest Americans have gotten unimaginably richer during this period of great upheaval .\nIf there is comfort to be found in the vague promises to use the pandemic as an opportunity to rethink society \u2014 the vows for a \u201c Great Reset , \u201d the pledges to \u201c Build Back Better \u201d \u2014 the comfort is immediately undone by the reality that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-science , anti-vaccine , anti-lockdown people to claim baseless conspiracy theories that go as far as suggesting the lockdowns are deliberately designed to speed up economic collapse .\nThese claims are not unique to the US .\nThere have been tremors in Canada , where a convoy of truckers and their supporters occupied downtown Ottawa for weeks and demanded the prime minister \u2019 s removal .\nOn the other side of the Atlantic , they \u2019 ve popped up in the Netherlands , Germany , and France .\nIt \u2019 s difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be repaired .\nThis is not , on the face of it , apocalyptic .\nThe lights are on and the trains run on time , for the most part .\nBut civic trust , the stuff of nation-building , believing that governments are capable of improving one \u2019 s life , seems to have dimmed .\nIn February , the Republican Party declared that the Jan. 6 insurrection and the preceding events that led to it constituted \u201c legitimate political discourse.\n\u201d At best , this is a direct attempt to minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst , the Republicans \u2019 declaration implies that the US \u2019 s political institutions are fraudulent and that any form of protest \u2014 including insurrection \u2014 is valid .\nThis may get the party votes in the upcoming midterm elections , but it \u2019 ll cost more than money : It \u2019 ll come at the price of further deterioration in public trust .\nFor months , US intelligence had been claiming that Russia intended to invade Ukraine .\nThat the intelligence was right is heartening .\nBut it also raises another question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything to stop it ?\nAmerica still prides itself on being the moral compass of the world , the keeper of the liberal order .\nWhy didn \u2019 t it move to act ?\nWhy didn \u2019 t we rally NATO and its allies to action ?\nOne thing we can deduce from the lack of action is that the plan , probably , was never to stop Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine .\nPresident Joe Biden had long talked up his plan of targeted sanctions and diplomatic pressure .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US and NATO were going to let Ukraine fall and figure out what to do afterward .\nThen Ukrainians started pushing back .\nIn a deeply rousing display of resistance , Ukrainians \u2014 led by a charismatic and direct president \u2014 made the case that they want to join the global liberal dream they \u2019 d heard so much about .\nFar from folding in front of Russian military might , Ukraine \u2019 s people used social media to tell a coherent and deeply moving story of national identity .\nIn essence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a weapon : Here we are , displaying the very values you preach and claim to defend \u2014 freedom , openness , transparency , and national pride \u2014 so will you come to defend us ?\nBut in making the plea , Ukraine exposed a problem with the West .\nIn the 30 years since the fall of the Soviet Union \u2014 nearly my entire lifetime \u2014 liberalism has come to be taken for granted , the will to defend it withered .\nThree decades of not articulating what you stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent years pointing out that the neat story America tells has actually been a lie .\nThe West , so secure in its superior narrative and assuredness that history has ended , has regularly defied some of its own fundamental tenets .\nIt has repeatedly violated state sovereignty ( see : the Iraq War ) .\nIt has overlooked certain crises ( see : Palestine ) in favor of strategic interests .\nAnd it has preached the transformative power of free trade while simultaneously cooking up extraordinary sanctions ( see : Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US may have claimed moral superiority , but Russia needn \u2019 t reach far to poke holes in it .\nSo now the rules-based order stands blemished , facing accusations of hypocrisy from its foes and disappointment from those who saw it as a beacon of hope .\nIf liberalism stands for defending freedom everywhere , it sure isn \u2019 t eager to show it .\nThe immediate consequence of this is another protracted war with no end in sight .\nThe medium term carries uncertainty and danger .\nIt turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys not gone , they may even be winning .\nSome parts of the West do not have the luxury of feeling distance from danger .\nIn the long term , the aftermath of the war in Ukraine means we can no longer tell ourselves the idealistic story that has only barely held up for the last 30 years .\nThe rules-based order that I \u2019 ve understood to be central to the world has been revealed to be ineffectual and incapable of fulfilling its promise .\nIn late February , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia invaded Ukraine , a batch of memes about surviving a pandemic \u201c to be rewarded with World War III \u201d made the rounds , followed by the usual admonishment .\nThis has happened before ( see : the escalating tensions with Iran in January 2020 ) .\nThe panic about memes generally carries the same tone \u2014 that memes are an unserious response to a major event from a generation that does not know how to regard it with the appropriate weight .\nBut consider this : For millennials and younger generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried a reordering of life on every level , from the personal to the global .\nIndividual bonds are changing in the midst of a pandemic .\nThe faint promise of a nation you can trust has waned .\nThere is no obvious immediate , or even distant , way back to the systems that governed us and the contracts that bound us before the pandemic .\nThat world , on every level , is gone .\nSo what \u2019 s next ?\nIn the immediate , more anxiety and disorder .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once had : \u201c How can we cope with the fear , if we can not overcome the causes of the fear ?\n\u201d In the Atlantic , Ed Yong pointed out that recently , there was one day when there were as many people who died of COVID as there were in the entire aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .\nA hundred thousand COVID deaths were deemed a tragedy in 2020 .\nNow , the US is hurtling toward 1 million .\nThis normalization of death is set against the normalization of defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of climate change .\nScientists have perhaps begun to run out of synonyms and journal-approved ways of saying \u201c a lot of people are going to die and life as we know it will change if we don \u2019 t do something about climate change now.\n\u201d On March 23 , 2020 , 12 days after the World Health Organization declared COVID a pandemic , the Harvard Business Review ran a piece titled \u201c The Discomfort You \u2019 re Feeling Is Grief.\n\u201d It immediately went viral .\nOn social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it summed up their inner turmoil and captured a sense that \u201c we are not used to this kind of collective grief in the air.\n\u201d But that feeling was localized , limited to a now-surreal stretch of time when some thought we \u2019 d only have to know terms like \u201c social distancing \u201d and \u201c lockdown \u201d for a brief stint .\nTwo years later , grief has become the air itself .\nWe are simultaneously grieving the former sturdiness of friendships , old relationships to government , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one investment research firm put it in a recent paper , \u201c The risk of Armageddon has risen dramatically .\nStay bullish on stocks over a 12-month horizon.\n\u201d There it is again .\nThat funny feeling .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Emotional federal lawmakers left Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2019 s personal appeal for aid promising to do more to help Ukraine , while at the same time acknowledging the US can not get directly involved or grant his request of a no-fly zone .\n\u201c I was crying , \u201d Sen. Joni Ernst said .\n\u201c I just think it \u2019 s very heartbreaking what the Ukrainians are going through .\nIt \u2019 s not just the loss of life , it \u2019 s the potential loss of an entire country.\n\u201d Lawmakers expressed an outpouring of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting .\nThere was near-unanimous support for aiding Ukraine as much as possible , but disagreement about how far that should extend .\nThere is bipartisan agreement that Zelensky \u2019 s request for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine remains off the table due to the risk of sparking a nuclear war with Russia .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no way that you can \u2019 t come out of that meeting without contemplating what more the United States can do to help , \u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things we can continue to do to help that doesn \u2019 t involve a potential nuclear war between the US and Russia.\n\u201d In his short virtual address , Zelensky urged Congress and the White House to ramp up sanctions on Russia and aid to Ukraine , with pleas separate from the request for a no-fly zone .\nAnd he asked for a new agreement between nations \u2014 \u201c a union of responsible countries \u201d \u2014 to head off attacks like this in the future .\n\u201c We are fighting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificing our lives in the name of the future , \u201d Zelensky said in English .\n\u201c That 's why today , the American people are helping not just Ukraine , but Europe and the world , to keep the planet alive .\nTo keep justice in history.\n\u201d Rep. Tom Malinowski said Zelensky is fully aware that the US can not enforce a no-fly zone due to the risk of escalation and that his speech to Congress was perfectly crafted to apply pressure for other measures .\nThose other measures could include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer of Polish fighter jets to Ukrainian forces .\nThere are reports that the former is already happening .\n\u201c I always felt that the point of the no-fly zone request is to make us feel guilty that we can \u2019 t do the no-fly zone so that we work harder on everything that we can do .\nIt \u2019 s brilliant .\nIt \u2019 s exactly what he should be doing , \u201d Malinowski said .\nRepublicans left the meeting calling for the White House to accept a proposal from Poland to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter planes to the Ukrainian Air Force .\nThe Biden administration rejected this proposal as not tenable because it risked escalating tensions between Russia and NATO and expanding the war beyond Ukraine \u2019 s borders .\nRepublicans are generally more dismissive of that risk , given that the US is already providing Ukraine with lethal aid .\n\u201c Quite frankly , we sent them stinger missiles that the Ukrainians are currently using to shoot helicopter pilots in the face , \u201d said Sen. James Lankford .\nDemocrats are more torn .\nSome are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they also warn about the disastrous consequences that would come from a hot war between Russia and NATO .\n\u201c We \u2019 re all concerned about how do we stop this short of escalation ?\nIt \u2019 s a terribly difficult conundrum , \u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown said .\nBrown said that the main fear is that Russian President Vladimir Putin would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons , possibly sparking a third world war .\nHe said that while sanctions and aid to Ukraine are likely working to contain Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian civilians .\n\u201c These are terrible , terrible choices , \u201d he said .\nSen. Lindsey Graham said he wanted to send the fighter jets despite the apocalyptic risk .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to have a nuclear war over this .\nThis is a bluff by Putin , \u201d Graham said .\n\u201c He may be a murderer but he is not suicidal.\n\u201d There were also some small bursts of optimism among lawmakers due to the success that worldwide sanctions have had in crippling Russia \u2019 s economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have managed to far surpass expectations in terms of repelling Russian invaders .\n\u201c There are forces at work here that give me some hope , \u201d Rep. Earl Blumenauer said .\n\u201c But that \u2019 s easy to say from a distance .\nIt \u2019 s not my constituents and family that are having bombs rain down on them .\n\u201d",

reserved for her and the boys \u2019 father .\nThe roses piled atop Vasyl \u2019 s grave had barely wilted before she put Kyrylo in the ground on Tuesday .\nThe entire village of Duliby , set in pastoral western Ukraine and home to 3,000 people , gathered to pay their respects to the older brother .\nHands clasped in praying form , they lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s body inside a small wooden church .\nPriests chanted the hymn \u201c The Suffering Mother , \u201d spoke of Kyrylo \u2019 s bravery , and said he had made the ultimate sacrifice for his country and people .\nA choir sang funeral hymns .\nThe lips of battle-hardened troops in uniform quivered .\nThe sweet scent of incense hung in the air .\nThe mourners then moved in a solemn procession from the church to the village cemetery , passing people who stood and kneeled outside their homes .\nWhen they stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly pressed uniforms played horns and performed a customary gun salute , firing four shots into the air .\nThe cracks of the rifles startled some of the war-weary people in the crowd .\nMany placed their hands over their hearts and sang the national anthem , which begins with the line , \u201c The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished.\n\u201d Vasyl , a 28-year-old senior lieutenant and paratrooper who first joined Ukraine \u2019 s armed forces as a fresh-faced 20-year-old in 2014 , was killed by Russian forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 3 .\nThe fighting was so intense there that it took days for the army to recover his body and evacuate it to Duliby , said Josef , a longtime family friend with a Cossack-style haircut .\nVasyl \u2019 s casket arrived sealed shut .\nHe was buried in a similar ceremony on March 9 .\nOn March 13 , Kyrylo , 35 , died amid a barrage of Russian missiles that struck the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security in Yavoriv , a town that sits 10 miles from the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until last month .\nAfter three weeks of heavy fighting , Russia \u2019 s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has intensified and spread across the country in recent days , with missiles and artillery pounding airports , military targets , and residential areas .\nThere

more realistic.\n\u201d \u201c However , time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine \u2019 s interests , \u201d he added .\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday that some parts of a potential peace deal were close to being agreed with Kyiv after it said it would discuss \u201c neutrality.\n\u201d The funeral for Kyrylo began Tuesday morning in Lviv , where his body and the bodies of three other soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Serhiy Melnyk \u2014 were brought in polished wooden caskets to the baroque Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church .\nHundreds of mourners who gathered there to pay their respects took turns approaching the caskets , touching them , and placing large bouquets of flowers atop them .\nMany made the sign of the cross , glanced upward , and mumbled prayers under their breath .\nMothers hugged the boxes holding their boys as priests doused them in holy water .\nWhen air raid sirens and warnings to take shelter blared from Lviv @ @ @ @ @ @

back of a hearse and driven 35 miles southwest to Duliby to be buried beside his younger brother .\nAfter nearly two hours , the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag that had covered Kyrylo \u2019 s casket throughout the day was folded and given to Vyshyvana by a Ukrainian army officer .\n\u201c Accept this flag as a symbol of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , \u201d the officer told Vyshyvana , who was too distraught to accept it and deferred to a family member .\nIt took a 10-man rotation 20 excruciating minutes to fill Kyrylo \u2019 s grave with dirt .\nVyshyvana wept uncontrollably the entire time and at one point collapsed to her knees and tumbled onto the grave of Vasyl .\n\u201c Why , God ?\nTrade me for them !\nPlease take me !\n\u201d she cried out .\n\u201c We are so proud of you boys .\nThe country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated until she was out of breath and the words faded into a chilling whisper .\nBeside her , wearing a black head wrap , was Mariana Lopushanska , the girlfriend of Vasyl .\nOverwhelmed with emotion , she fainted and fell at the foot of his grave .\n\u201c God takes the very best ones , \u201d Halyna , a neighbor , said of the Vyshyvaniy boys .\nVasyl loved playing soccer and was on the local team when he was younger , Josef said .\nVasyl joined the military in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\nKyrylo , 35 , supported the decision , and in 2017 he also joined

Marco Rubio , the lead sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make daylight saving time permanent , but this is the first time his legislation has passed the Senate .\nIn a video last week before the US sprung forward , Rubio said , \u201c Switching in and out of Daylight Saving Time is outdated , and it 's only a source of annoyance and confusion .\nFrankly , it 's just dumb , and there 's just no other way to say it.\n\u201d Twenty states , including Florida , have taken steps to stick with daylight saving time year-round , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those to take effect , Rubio said .\nThe bill will allow states to pass their own laws to continue changing their clocks twice per year if they want to stick with the current norm in most of the county ; Arizona and Hawaii don \u2019 t observe daylight saving time at all .\n\u201c No more dark afternoons in the winter .\nNo more losing an hour of sleep every spring .\nWe want more sunshine during our most productive waking hours , \u201d Democratic Sen. Patty Murray , another sponsor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve said it before and I \u2019 ll say it again : Americans want more sunshine and less depression.\n\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Biden supports the bill or would sign it if it comes to his desk .\nThe US first adopted daylight saving time in 1918 .\nThe idea was to add extra sunlight hours in the summer to conserve energy needed to light homes and businesses , though some studies suggest that we \u2019 re not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographic .\nAmerica tried making daylight saving time permanent once before \u2014 and then quickly abandoned it .\nThe Nixon administration extended daylight saving hours to the winter in January of 1974 .\nAt the time , a majority of Americans supported the move .\nBut as the winter wore on , the benefit of lighter evenings was undercut by darker mornings .\nSupport dropped and the experiment was not renewed the following winter .\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse , the lead Democratic sponsor of the bill , addressed some of that criticism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that he understood that morning people would lose an hour of daylight .\nBut , he said , the change will give more daylight for kids who are coming home from school to play outside and for people running errands in the early evening .\n\u201c There are a lot fewer people up and about between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning than there are between 4:15 and 5:15 in the afternoon , \u201d he said .\nWhitehouse said he \u2019 d gotten a \u201c very strong response from constituents \u201d in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c hopeful \u201d that the House will pass it as well .\nLast week , a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on the matter where a panel of experts unanimously supported ending the practice of changing clocks twice per year .\nThe problem was they disagreed on whether daylight saving time or standard time should be the permanent solution .\nBeth Malow , a neurology and pediatrics professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , said that making standard time permanent would be the healthiest option .\nShe said exposing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less in the evening cuts back on sleep deprivation .\nConversely , waking up when it is still dark out causes circadian misalignment \u2014 when the sun is not synced to the cycle of your daily life .\nMalow said this increases sleep deprivation , which leads to increased health issues like obesity , depression , ADHD , and cancer .\nShe said the most vulnerable groups are students and people who work early and can \u2019 t control their hours , which tends to be people of lower socioeconomic status .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become alert , to get ourselves going .\nKids need to be alert to go to school , to learn , \u201d Malow said .\nSome industry groups support permanent daylight saving time because lighter evenings are good for the economy \u2014 people feel comfortable being out later in the evening , where they are more likely to spend money .\nUniversity of Washington law professor Steve Calandrillo also made a health and safety argument in favor of permanent daylight saving time .\nCalandrillo told Congress that the evening rush hour period is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to increased traffic , more children playing outside , more alcohol consumed by drivers , and an increased rush to get home .\nExtending daylight to the evening rush hour period would be a big net safety benefit , Calandrillo said , even if it meant the morning rush hour became more dangerous .\nOne Rutgers University study found that permanent daylight saving time could lead to 366 fewer traffic fatalities during the rush hour periods per year .\nCalandrillo also argued that crime would decrease due to the lighter evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets dark .\nAs for the effect on school children waking up and going to school in the dark , Calandrillo proposed a compromise : pair permanent daylight saving time with pushing back the start of school .\nHe said this would help to offset the risks of driving in the morning when it is still dark .\n\u201c We need to be pushing back school times , especially for teenagers , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If we pushed it back we could deal with some of the danger of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight saving time .\n\u201d",

''\nLast summer , Cotton stopped into the Third Annual Machine Gun Shoot in Hillsborough , New Hampshire , to fire off a few rounds .\nHe was a speaker at a tailgate event at the University of Iowa a couple of months later .\nAnd in December , he gifted VIP attendees of the Cheshire County Christmas Party copies of his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Lane , the state committee \u2019 s secretary , said there were concerns he wouldn \u2019 t attract people to the event since he \u2019 d visited the state so often .\n\u201c But it turns out he was a good draw , \u201d she said .\n\u201c He \u2019 s much more personable than he comes across on TV , \u201d Lane said .\n\u201c And I was really impressed with his handshake .\nYou can tell a lot by these people how they shake your hand.\n\u201d Cotton , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is just one of many potential 2024 candidates who \u2019 ve traveled to the early states in recent months : Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo attended a fundraiser in Iowa on Friday .\nFormer vice president Mike Pence , Sen.

Ted Cruz , and Nikki Haley , the former UN ambassador , have all made preliminary rounds .\nAnd despite Cotton \u2019 s early outreach , he has not performed well in public polling so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 % in Echelon insights and McLaughlin & Associates surveys , in company with Sen. Mitt Romney and Rep. Liz Cheney .\nLast month , Cotton tied with Sen. Marco Rubio and Ben Carson in the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll with just .03 % .\nCotton is trying to build a national case as a law-and-order , tough-on-defense candidate \u2014 clearly on display in his recent and very intense speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library .\nThere , he put forth Andrew Jackson as a standard-bearer , railed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes from American history , argued for \u201c restoring patriotic education \u201d by ending critical race theory , and lobbied for ending trade concessions to China and remaining tough on Vladimir Putin .\nIn the speech , he especially criticized the First Step Act , the Trump-era bipartisan criminal justice law that changed some sentencing rules , calling it the \u201c worst mistake of \u201d the former president 's tenure .\nCotton called for ending the \u201c carnage \u201d of crime and made an extended allusion to Jackson .\n\u201c Here we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Cotton said in the speech .\n\u201c In 1818 , criminals and marauders used lawless portions of Spanish Florida as bases to attack and kill American citizens .\nIn response , General Jackson invaded Spanish territory , rooted out those responsible , and then conquered the Spanish capital just for good measure .\nWe should show the same resolve in the face of crime and lawlessness today.\n\u201d How to handle crime and the criminal justice system has divided Republicans in recent years : The 2020 Republican convention featured both people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about the need to get tough on crime and invoking the kinds of metaphors Cotton used .\nDoug Collins , a former Republican member of Congress who helped steer the legislation , defended the First Step Act this week , saying that the law focused on \u201c preparing men and women to come back into society \u201d and reducing recidivism , rather than having to do with the uptick in crime .\n\u201c I think it 's Tom Cotton being Tom Cotton .\nHe 's never agreed with this plan , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure why you would be against that , and especially when Donald Trump showed that it actually helped people .\nIt \u2019 s an easy attack from a conservative position , but without taking into account the realities of what 's happening.\n\u201d The overall case Cotton made last week , though , largely embraces the themes Trump ran on in 2016 when he upended Republican politics .\nIf Trump doesn \u2019 t run again , the field may actually be wide open .\nAnd Iowa and New Hampshire are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who take the time .\nThe last two Republican Iowa caucus winners \u2014 Cruz and former senator Rick Santorum \u2014 spent months and months in the state .\n`` In Iowa , people appreciate not only coming to the state ; often , they appreciate making an effort to come to every corner of the state , '' Kaufmann said .\nBefore the 2008 primary , John McCain debarked a plane in Manchester , New Hampshire , \u201c with a suitcase in hand , no aides , no money , \u201d the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on to make the rounds to about 400 of the state \u2019 s town halls before eventually securing the Republican nomination .\n\u201c We have to meet somebody four or five times before we make a decision of whether we support him for president or not , \u201d Lane said .",

Tom Cotton \u2019 s office may result in an overhaul in the nation \u2019 s time zones .\nReporters and politicos were caught off guard Tuesday afternoon when the Sunshine Protection Act sailed through the Senate without issue , with no senators speaking up to object to it passing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving as Senate chair overseeing the motion at the time , broke composure , burst into a grin , and whispered , \u201c Yes !\n\u201d \u201c I was surprised that someone didn \u2019 t object , \u201d she told BuzzFeed News the next day , while noting that Arizona does not change its clocks , \u201c because we \u2019 re smart.\n\u201d Any single senator could have blocked the daylight saving bill from passing but many didn \u2019 t know it was even happening .\nSen.

        "title": "10 Things That Can Affect Your Dreams At Night",
        "content": "Humans have been fascinated by dreams throughout history .\nAncient civilizations regarded what we see in our sleep as powerful messages from deities or an essential way to make sense of waking life .\nEven today , there are societies with deep-rooted \u201c dream cultures , \u201d said Rubin Naiman , a fellow with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and clinical assistant professor of medicine at the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona .\n\u201c They believe dreaming is as important as waking , \u201d he said , challenging the \u201c wake-centric \u201d perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world .\nWhile we can \u2019 t definitively say what role dreams play in our waking lives , we do know they are important .\nScience shows that brain scans light up with activity when people dream , and there are physical responses that seem hardwired to encourage it , including body systems that essentially render you unconscious , paralyze you , and then wipe your memory of the dreamlike state .\nYet the question remains : to what end ?\nIf our body is supposed to be resting and restoring , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios like a mash-up of snakes , school , and someone you ran into last week ?\nHere are some of the reasons why you dream and the things that happen in your waking life that can influence them .\nA healthy sleep cycle rotates through four stages , said Chelsie Rohrscheib , head sleep specialist and neuroscientist at Wesper , a digital sleep clinic that aims to help people manage sleep disorders and improve sleep quality .\nStages one through three flow through a light , medium , and deep state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more .\nYou then enter into REM \u2014 or rapid eye movement \u2014 sleep , when your brain looks almost as active as it does when you \u2019 re awake .\nMost people who wake up during REM sleep will report having dreams , but dreams can also occur in different stages of sleep as well .\nA few physical changes play out during this part of our sleep cycle as well , Naiman said .\nThe body and mind seem to separate .\nFirst off , measures like your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure start bouncing all over the place , looking more like what happens when we are awake .\n\u201c We also experience something called REM atonia , which is fundamentally a paralysis of our voluntary muscles , \u201d he adds .\n\u201c We actually can \u2019 t move , and this makes sense \u2014 mother nature wants to protect us from acting the dream out.\n\u201d In fact , a ( very ) small percentage of the population has REM sleep behavior disorder , or a breakdown of this REM atonia process .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neurology , people with the condition usually find out after winding up at the doctor \u2019 s office from injuring themselves or their partner \u201c due to violent movements during sleep.\n\u201d ( There \u2019 s also something called sleep paralysis , where atonia persists even after you are conscious , temporarily making it impossible to move or speak . )\nThen there \u2019 s the brain during REM sleep .\nWhile it starts powering up to resemble wakefulness , there are some key differences .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a profound disconnect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function \u2014 and what goes on in the lower limbic areas , particularly the hippocampus , \u201d Naiman said .\nIn a nutshell : The parts of your brain responsible for logic and reasoning stop communicating with the parts involved in emotion , creativity , and memory .\nWhy don \u2019 t you remember your dreams ?\nThis intra-brain disconnect is a big reason behind why your dreams often make no sense .\nWith our logic centers more or less switched off , unrealistic scenarios like having the ability to fly feel real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also why you might struggle to remember dreams .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t actually activate our memory centers when we \u2019 re in REM sleep , because the brain is actively working on those centers , \u201d Rohrscheib said .\n\u201c So it kind of shuts down the process of forming new memories while you \u2019 re dreaming.\n\u201d If you do remember your dream on waking \u2014 even if it \u2019 s very fleeting \u2014 that just means you probably woke up in the middle of this REM stage .\nSo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t exactly prove ancient civilizations wrong , but our understanding of why we dream has evolved .\nSigmund Freud \u2019 s psychoanalytic approach in the early 20th century regarded dreams as messages from our own subconscious \u2014 reflections of our deepest desires and unfulfilled wishes .\nThen there was the activation-synthesis hypothesis .\nDeveloped in the 1970s , this theory posits that dreams are nothing more than random series of images created by our brain \u2019 s REM activity .\nAny symbolism we impose on them is simply subjective .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is deeply psychological , and the other is deeply biological , \u201d Naiman said .\nWhile scientists still aren \u2019 t certain why you dream , today \u2019 s leading theories fall more in the middle of the spectrum .\nEach day is full of new experiences and information to process , much of which gets temporarily stored in our short-term memory , Rohrscheib said .\nThen overnight , the transfer of this short-term information into long-term memory requires your brain \u2019 s neurons to \u201c replay \u201d the initial experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this occurs during REM sleep .\nBut this sequence of neurons firing doesn \u2019 t necessarily follow a narrative or storyline \u2014 it can be totally random and disorganized from our perspective .\n\u201c And that can result in weird dreams , \u201d she said .\nBut it \u2019 s clear that dreams do play an important role in learning and memory , even if they don \u2019 t seem to make sense .\nResearch shows , for example , that people learning a new physical skill , like playing tennis , perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of time spent awake .\nThe research also suggests that if you \u2019 re studying for a big test , you \u2019 re more likely to remember the information if you memorize it and then get some sleep , rather than pull an all-nighter .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a bit of a consensus emerging that dreams are there to deal with emotionally challenging or difficult issues that a person is grappling with in their lives , \u201d said Alan Eiser , a clinical lecturer at University of Michigan Medical School and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNaiman said to think of it like this : just like our gastrointestinal system is responsible for making critical decisions about what it allows in the body , REM sleep is like our brain \u2019 s gut .\n\u201c If you eat something that \u2019 s difficult to digest , it takes a little more effort on the part of the gut , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Likewise , experiences that are difficult to digest when we \u2019 re awake get processed symbolically in a dream state.\n\u201d This is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually be essential to our mental health .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve known for 50 or 60 years that damaged dream patterns are associated with clinical depression , \u201d Naiman said .\n\u201c If we don \u2019 t dream , we suffer from a sort of psychological indigestion , which can show up as mood disorders.\n\u201d Research published in Current Biology points to a theory behind this emotional digestion .\nThe study shows that during REM sleep , neurotransmitters associated with stress and anxiety in our waking life start to plummet .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ our brain may be better equipped to process highly emotional or difficult experiences .\nDreaming may help you manage your stress response \u201c We also think [ REM sleep ] may be priming the area of your brain that responds to stress , \u201d Rohrscheib said .\nShe said to think of it like a full brain reboot after your neurons have been using energy all day to make connections .\nThat \u2019 s why if you don \u2019 t get a sufficient amount of sleep , things that wouldn \u2019 t normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreams may even act as a sort of training exercise to deal with stress .\nA study published in the Journal of Sleep Research suggests that during REM sleep , you have high levels of activity in the amygdala ( the part of the brain associated with our fight-or-flight reaction ) .\nWhile research is ongoing , this activity could be the brain \u2019 s way of prepping you emotionally to respond to stresses in waking life .\nThere \u2019 s still a lot we don \u2019 t know about dreams .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why certain dreams are super common in the general population , \u201d Rohrscheib said , such as dreams many people have experienced , like having your teeth fall out , flying , or being naked at school .\n\u201c Why are these so similar across a vast variety of demographics ?\n\u201d But researchers have homed in on some ways that behavior influences the brain \u2019 s REM sleep \u2014 and , therefore , may impact your dreams ( for better and for worse ) .\n\u201c Certain antidepressants \u2014 like SSRIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep early in the night , \u201d Eiser said .\n\u201c And then , late in the night , you get very dense REM periods.\n\u201d That means there \u2019 s intense rapid eye movement happening and very vivid dreaming .\nSSRIs , or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , include drugs like fluoxetine ( Prozac ) or sertraline ( Zoloft ) , and SNRIs are serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , which include venlafaxine ( Effexor ) and duloxetine ( Cymbalta ) .\nBut a laundry list of prescriptions list vivid dreaming or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure medication , antihistamines , steroids like prednisone , cholesterol-lowering statins , the anesthetic ketamine , and drugs used to treat Parkinson \u2019 s disease .\nWhether you got into a fight with your partner , have a big deadline coming up , or are nervous about a first date , everyone has bad or anxious dreams from time to time .\nBut you shouldn \u2019 t have consistent , chronic nightmares , Dr. Rohrscheib said .\n\u201c It may be tied to your mental health , but other sleep disorders can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apnea.\n\u201d People with anxiety or depression tend to be more likely to report having nightmares or bad dreams .\nA 2018 study in the journal Scientific Reports found that people who had more peace of mind in their waking life also had dreams to match , reporting more positive dreams where they felt amused or inspired .\nIn comparison , people with anxiety tended to have more dreams with negative emotions such as fear or upset .\nNightmares are a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder and often involve reliving the traumatic event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night terrors , which is when people ( most often children ) wake up screaming in intense fear but usually don \u2019 t remember the episodes in the morning .\nAbout 20 % to 30 % of children have frequent nightmares compared with only 5 % to 8 % of adults .\n\u201c Stress affects the areas of the brain that are highly active during REM sleep , \u201d Rohrscheib said .\nScientists believe that during REM sleep , these areas work to condition our brains so that we \u2019 re better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day .\nSo if you add more stress ( or an anxiety disorder , for example ) , it could result in more stressful or bad dreams than usual .\nIf you \u2019 ve pulled a few all-nighters recently , research shows your brain actually tries to \u201c catch up \u201d on its REM cycles .\nIt \u2019 s called the REM rebound effect and refers to how the frequency , depth , and intensity of REM sleep increases when we \u2019 ve been sleep deprived \u2014 all of which can trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the flip side , overindulging your snooze button could weigh down your dreams .\nA study published in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology explored why people have nightmares .\nWhile the team homed in on causes you might expect , like having anxiety or feeling negative emotions , they found that people who slept more than nine hours a night also reported more frequent nightmares .\nSome research suggests that regular exercise might lower the risk of nightmares and even dreaming in general by reducing both depression and time in REM sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in deep , restorative sleep .\nBut like most things in life , balance is key .\nA recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology suggests that people with either extremely low or extremely high activity levels can experience poor sleep quality .\nIf you get a period , you can thank your hormones for odder-than-usual dreams in the premenstrual phase of your cycle .\nResearch published in the Journal of Sleep Medicine and Disorders suggests that hormone fluctuations often alter sleep patterns \u2014 especially REM .\nWhile this can mean less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake you up more frequently , so you remember your dreams more vividly .\nStill , these disturbances may come with a silver lining .\nA study published in Medical Sciences found that most people experience more pleasant dreams as their hormones bounce around before their period .\nAnd if you take a hormonal contraceptive , you may be even more likely to recall your dreams .\nHaving a nightcap may help lull you off to sleep , but alcohol actually suppresses REM sleep early in your slumber , which can lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle .\n\u201c Then people tend to get a REM rebound with very vivid dreaming at the end of the night , \u201d Eiser said .\nWithdrawal from alcohol or drugs , like barbiturates and benzodiazepines , are associated with nightmares because of the REM rebound effect .\nMarijuana users commonly report using the drug as a sleep aid , but consistent use actually suppresses dream states , Rohrscheib said , and recent research adds some context to this understanding .\nA study published in Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine found that regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns , with users more likely to say they were sleeping less than six hours a night or more than nine hours a night compared to nonusers .\nThose longer and shorter sleep patterns could be linked to more vivid dreams , although it \u2019 s not clear if the cannabis use was the cause of the sleep patterns , the result , or unrelated .\nBecause researchers suspect that cannabis suppresses our REM cycle , quitting may lead to some pretty strange , vivid dreams thanks to the rebound effect .\nGood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the experts .\nIn other words , doing those things that help promote sleep \u2014 like making sure you \u2019 re in a quiet , dark room and making other sleep-promoting lifestyle changes \u2014 can help dreams too .\n\u201c The goal is to get a sufficient amount of each sleep stage , \u201d Rohrscheib said .\n\u201c But if you don \u2019 t follow good sleep hygiene , you can , unfortunately , limit your brain \u2019 s ability to move through those sleep stages efficiently.\n\u201d This means you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nighttime awakenings .\n\u201c This can result in undercutting the amount of deep sleep and REM sleep you 're getting.\n\u201d So how do you build dreamier sleep hygiene ?\nRohrscheib said to stick to a strict sleep schedule ( even on the weekends ! )\n, avoid things like alcohol , sugar , and caffeine before bed , and don \u2019 t lie in bed staring at a screen \u2014 the blue light it emits can keep your body from preparing for sleep .\nWhile there \u2019 s still a lot that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what influences them , one thing seems certain : They \u2019 re important to our well-being .\n\u201c REM is the least understood sleep stage ; we can only hypothesize why dreams happen , \u201d Rohrscheib said .\n\u201c But without REM sleep , we know it \u2019 s difficult for us to learn , to remember things , and we can even start to have issues with our stress response and overall mental health .\n\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former president Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign organization was ordered to pay more than $ 350,000 in legal fees and expenses for trying to enforce an \u201c unenforceable \u201d nondisclosure agreement against former staffer Alva Johnson , according to an order entered this month in a nonpublic arbitration case .\nThe March 10 order , which was made public this week by Johnson \u2019 s attorneys , was the latest setback for the Trump campaign in its effort to use NDAs to try to punish former staffers who publicly criticize or take legal action against Trump .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s effort to sue Trump failed \u2014 she accused him of trying to forcibly kiss her and raised pay discrimination claims , but the case was tossed out \u2014 the campaign couldn \u2019 t invoke a legally unsound nondisclosure agreement .\nTrump has a history of trying to use arbitration , much of which takes place in private , to try to keep potentially damaging or embarrassing claims out of court , where hearings and documents are generally public .\nWhen he ran for president in 2016 , many campaign workers were reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred them from sharing information about the campaign or saying negative things about Trump , his family , and his businesses ; the agreement specified that the campaign could press complaints about alleged violations of the agreement in arbitration .\nIn two previous cases , though , a judge and an arbitrator concluded that key sections of that agreement were too vague and ill-defined to be constitutionally enforceable .\nThe arbitrator handling Johnson \u2019 s case , Victor Bianchini , a retired federal magistrate judge from California , found those decisions persuasive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson late last year .\nThat left a request by Johnson \u2019 s lawyers to have the campaign pay their legal bills as the winning party .\nBianchini agreed they were entitled to those fees and ordered the campaign to pay $ 303,285 ; the campaign will also have to cover the costs of the arbitration itself , which came to around $ 50,000 .\n\u201c The Trump campaign has tried to use its unenforceable NDA to unlawfully silence its critics , \u201d Johnson \u2019 s lawyer Hassan Zavareei said in a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrator has held that these efforts can not stand and ordered the campaign to compensate our client for the hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that the campaign forced her to incur.\n\u201d Trump spokesperson Liz Harrington provided a statement calling the outcome `` pathetic and totally contrary to the rule of law and any reasonable sense of fairness . ''\n`` After Johnson \u2019 s total defeat , President Trump sought damages for Johnson \u2019 s disgusting lies about him in arbitration .\nBut instead of enforcing a crystal clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson pay for her nasty conduct , Johnson \u2019 s fraud was rewarded with an award of attorneys \u2019 fees .\nAnyone can see that Johnson \u2019 s blatant lies and bad faith conduct completely preclude her from profiting from her illicit conduct , especially after a video revealed that President Trump did nothing wrong , '' Harrington said .\nBianchini described the case as \u201c procedurally tortured \u201d as he recounted the legal twists that led the fight to come before him .\nIn early 2019 , Johnson filed a lawsuit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court \u2014 a public case , unlike the private arbitration .\nJohnson claimed that during a campaign stop in August 2016 , Trump had tried to kiss her .\nIn addition to a battery claim related to the kiss incident , Johnson , who is Black , lodged allegations that she \u2019 d been paid less than other campaign workers because of her gender and race .\nA few months after Johnson filed the lawsuit , the judge dismissed it , finding that it relied too heavily on previous , unrelated allegations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on details about the alleged pay discrimination .\nThe judge gave Johnson an opportunity to refile the lawsuit , explaining that she \u2019 d need to streamline the battery claim and beef up the pay-related parts .\n\u201c As currently stated , the Complaint presents a political lawsuit , not a tort and wages lawsuit .\nPlaintiff will receive a fair day in court , but the Court will try a tort and wages dispute \u2014 not a political one , \u201d US District Judge William Jung wrote at the time .\nShortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump campaign released a video of the campaign stop encounter at the heart of Johnson \u2019 s battery claim .\nIt shows Trump greeting a group of people inside an RV , and as the camera pans to Johnson , the candidate can be seen leaning toward her and giving her a kiss in the area of her cheek as he holds her shoulders .\nJung apparently expressed some concern about whether Johnson \u2019 s battery claim would be viable in light of the footage , according to Bianchini \u2019 s summary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up refiling the case .\nHer lawyers at the time maintained that the video didn \u2019 t clear Trump of wrongdoing \u2014 attorney Zavareei described the scene in a statement to CNN as Trump \u201c grabbing \u201d his client and \u201c pulling her into him \u201d to kiss her in front of others \u2014 but that they \u2019 d decided to drop the case given Jung \u2019 s apparent skepticism and his admonition that she couldn \u2019 t bring in information about past allegations of harassment from others against Trump .\nThe fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn September 2019 , the campaign filed a demand for arbitration that accused Johnson of violating the nondisclosure agreement that she \u2019 d signed .\nWhile the campaign \u2019 s arbitration case against Johnson was pending , two other former Trump campaign staffers \u2014 Jessica Denson and Omarosa Manigault Newman , who also served in the White House for a period of time \u2014 won challenges to NDAs that they \u2019 d signed that were identical to the one at issue in Johnson \u2019 s case .\nDenson prevailed in federal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn November , Bianchini dismissed the campaign \u2019 s arbitration case against Johnson .\nCiting the decisions in Denson and Manigault Newman \u2019 s cases , the arbitrator concluded that the confidentiality and nondisparagement sections of the NDA were \u201c vague and unenforceable.\n\u201d Bianchini quoted sections of those earlier rulings finding that the nondisclosure language could \u201c conceivably cover any information related to the campaign \u201d and had no time limit , and the scope of the nondisparagement language , which appeared to cover potentially hundreds of companies affiliated with Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad .\nJohnson \u2019 s lawyers then filed a petition for the Trump campaign to cover their fees and expenses , totaling around $ 380,000 .\nThe Trump campaign , represented by attorney Justin Clark , opposed the request , arguing that the arbitration and the federal lawsuit that came before it were based on \u201c a politically motivated lie that Respondent shamelessly created and advanced in court and the media.\n\u201d But Bianchini found that the campaign \u2019 s effort to try to punish Johnson for her conduct in the federal case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case she \u2019 d won in arbitration was \u201c misguided and incorrect.\n\u201d The campaign could have pursued its own civil claims against her for malicious prosecution or defamation , he wrote , but they didn \u2019 t , instead trying to enforce parts of an NDA that multiple decision-makers had concluded were invalid .\nThe arbitrator rejected the Trump campaign \u2019 s argument that Johnson and her lawyers had acted in bad faith in their defense against the arbitration complaint .\nHe did reduce the amount that Johnson \u2019 s lawyers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours they \u2019 d claimed were excessive ; he noted that he didn \u2019 t think the tally of hours was dishonest but likely the result of \u201c inefficiency , \u201d and he praised attorneys on both sides for their competence and professionalism .\nThe Trump campaign will also have to cover $ 2,950 in fees to the American Arbitration Association and $ 43,948 to compensate Bianchini for his work on the case .",

        "content": "Two-thirds of the way through his claustrophobic 2021 comedy special Inside , Bo Burnham briefly strips away all the humor and launches into \u201c That Funny Feeling.\n\u201d It \u2019 s an intimate , quiet song that draws its power from its lyrical conceit .\nHis verses are constructed of modern contradictions ( \u201c stunning 8K resolution meditation app \u201d ) and phrases that at face value are absurd ( \u201c the live-action Lion King \u201d ) , while the chorus once again contends with the titular feeling .\nExcept Burnham does not name the feeling .\nInstead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off .\nThe song doesn \u2019 t work if the idea of a \u201c stunning 8K resolution meditation app \u201d doesn \u2019 t arouse something similar in you , too .\nIt \u2019 s vaguely dystopian , disoriented , unmoored .\nBurnham and I are roughly the same age .\nI was 1 when the Berlin Wall fell .\nI was 3 by the time the Soviet Union collapsed .\nBurnham and I are in the middle range of millennials , a generation born into the longest period of global American supremacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this stretch .\nIn the West , it \u2019 s been understood as an era of stability ; in the early 1990s , one political scientist even suggested we \u2019 ve arrived at the \u201c end of history , \u201d an argument that , following the triumph of Western liberal democracies over other arrangements of governments , there would be no going back .\nAnd so it was for most of my life that history has been over .\nThe general edicts of the rules-based order and liberal society have applied .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ US became the central axis around which the world spun .\nAmerican wars no longer had specific ideological enemies ; instead , they were fought against concepts \u2014 public opinion was mobilized to engage in a war on \u201c terror.\n\u201d Two years before I was born , in the spring of 1986 , German sociologist Ulrich Beck published the book Risk Society .\nBeck \u2019 s ambitions were high .\nHe was grasping for a unifying theory , trying to name an ethos of anxiety and uncertainty , a pervasive vagueness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preface , he declares that he takes issue with the \u201c post- \u201d prefix ; at the time , everything was \u201c post- \u201d \u2014 postwar , postindustrial , postmodern , postcolonial .\nBeck was unsatisfied with that frame because \u201c post- \u201d is a negative definition .\nIt defines what something is not .\nThat we are \u201c postmodern \u201d tells you very little about what has replaced modernity .\nBeck argued that we were actually in a \u201c risk \u201d society \u2014 a very cool , not-at-all-alarming name \u2014 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global , anonymous , invisible threats .\nBut Beck didn \u2019 t stop at naming it \u2014 he offered a way forward : a framework for how to live in a risk society .\nHis fundamental question : \u201c How can we cope with the fear , if we can not overcome the causes of the fear ?\nHow can we live on the volcano of civilization without deliberately forgetting about it , but also without suffocating on the fears \u2014 and not just on the vapors that the volcano exudes ?\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volcano .\nTwo years after the start of a global pandemic that has killed millions around the world and nearly a million in the US and upended the lives of everyone on the planet , we find ourselves at a crossroads at every level of our lives .\nOn a personal level , our friendships have been reordered .\nOn a national level , technology has accelerated a complete breakdown in trust of institutions that once served to keep us together .\nGlobally , a war in Ukraine has exposed the fragility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collective reluctant action to fight the climate crisis has deepened instability and thrown into doubt the idea that we can avoid dire consequences .\nWe are undergoing a colossal vibe shift that extends beyond taste , aesthetics , politics , fashion , or policy .\nThe world as we knew it is not coming back , and it \u2019 s entirely reasonable that we may find ourselves plagued with a general restlessness , a vague notion of disorder .\nIt \u2019 s that funny feeling .\nThey may have been days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the pandemic were also a time of togetherness .\nThis went beyond a performative online unity .\nThere was a general sense that we were all vulnerable to a virus we still knew little about .\nGlobal economic machinery , for the most part , had ground to a halt .\nCity streets were empty , save for the essential workers in hospitals , grocery stores , and other services required for survival .\nTo let them know we appreciated the risk they were taking , many of us gathered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang on pots and pans as a chaotic expression of gratitude .\nOn social media and in news articles , experts told us to take care of ourselves , to check on each other , and not to let the social bonds fray .\nPeople held \u201c Zoom parties \u201d as a consolatory replacement for the real thing .\nWe may be apart , we declared , but we \u2019 ll find a way back to each other .\nBeloved musicians asked for patience and promised , \u201c There will be light after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t 6 feet apart.\n\u201d Actors , uh , tried to reassure us .\nBut as the pandemic wore on , and waves crested and waned , a new set of politics started to emerge : the politics of risk .\nMany of us found ourselves gravitating toward friends who shared the same risk tolerance as us .\nAlliances formed based on how willing people were to spend time with each other IRL or how willing they were to maintain a digital relationship .\nFriendships weakened over differing ideas of what constitutes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn a deeper level , the pandemic has introduced an elevated tenor of personal politics .\nIn this way , the pandemic enlarged politics , making it the most immediate thing about relationships .\nThis process , which was certainly underway long before COVID \u2014 quite visibly so during the Trump presidency \u2014 has become even more acute as a willingness to follow health requirements became a kind of litmus test for friendship eligibility .\nOn the one hand , it \u2019 s a deeply cynical , destructive , and indeed existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people bought it .\nThe good news is that Trump is not currently president .\nThe bad news is that on his way out , he dealt a near-fatal blow to those institutions when he encouraged supporters to \u201c fight like hell \u201d and march on the Capitol .\nSure , the system held up and rebuffed Trump \u2019 s play .\nBut the cost was deep disarray , a rattled political realm that has not yet fully contended with the image of one president tarnishing the system .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding a dangerous precedent is one of the most destabilizing things you can do .\nAnd who knows who will be compelled to push the precedent further next time ?\nThe more immediate question for American democracy is : Why did more people vote for Donald Trump in 2020 than in 2016 ?\nSurely they didn \u2019 t miss the news cycle of his entire presidency .\nIt \u2019 s impossible to have missed him systematically subverting the institutions that governments rely on .\nSo could it be that they bought the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nDid his presidency confirm something about decay in general social trust ?\nConsider the Edelman Trust Barometer .\nThe public relations firm has been conducting an annual global survey measuring public confidence in institutions since 2000 .\nIts 2022 report , which found that distrust is now \u201c society \u2019 s default emotion , \u201d recorded a trend of collapsing faith in institutions such as government or media .\nThough it \u2019 s easy to be dismissive of Trump \u2019 s crass nihilist threat , it \u2019 s far harder to contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed .\nAfter decades of letting inequality worsen , those with their hands on the levers of American democracy suddenly found the will and drive to send thousands of dollars into the bank accounts of every American .\nUS households grew their wealth by $ 13.5 trillion in 2020 thanks in part to generous government spending to keep the economy afloat .\nThis may solve one big problem \u2014 how people were supposed to pay their rent and mortgages while work was closed \u2014 but it introduced a new one : Wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this any time it wanted ?\nSoon it became clear that even the wealth gains of the pandemic were not equal .\nBecause of an unexpected stock market boom , \u200b\u200bmore than 70 % of the increase in household wealth went to the top 20 % of income earners .\nGenerally , workers with higher incomes saw their lot improve due to the sweeping economic changes of COVID .\nMeanwhile , temporary pandemic aid programs helped reduce child poverty in the US before they were pulled back in late 2021 .\nIt \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even \u2014 to conclude that successive American governments have not considered widening income inequality to be an urgent problem .\nIt \u2019 s rational to conclude that successive American governments have been asleep at the wheel , content with general economic growth while not paying attention to where that growth was going .\nThat we have social language for this is a meaningful success of the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011 .\nIts physical impact may have been short , but its rhetorical one is a reimagination of the public language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 99 percent \u2014 and by every imaginable metric , the lives of the 1 percent have been getting better , even during a global pandemic .\nIndeed , the richest Americans have gotten unimaginably richer during this period of great upheaval .\nIf there is comfort to be found in the vague promises to use the pandemic as an opportunity to rethink society \u2014 the vows for a \u201c Great Reset , \u201d the pledges to \u201c Build Back Better \u201d \u2014 the comfort is immediately undone by the reality that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-science , anti-vaccine , anti-lockdown people to claim baseless conspiracy theories that go as far as suggesting the lockdowns are deliberately designed to speed up economic collapse .\nThese claims are not unique to the US .\nThere have been tremors in Canada , where a convoy of truckers and their supporters occupied downtown Ottawa for weeks and demanded the prime minister \u2019 s removal .\nOn the other side of the Atlantic , they \u2019 ve popped up in the Netherlands , Germany , and France .\nIt \u2019 s difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be repaired .\nThis is not , on the face of it , apocalyptic .\nThe lights are on and the trains run on time , for the most part .\nBut civic trust , the stuff of nation-building , believing that governments are capable of improving one \u2019 s life , seems to have dimmed .\nIn February , the Republican Party declared that the Jan. 6 insurrection and the preceding events that led to it constituted \u201c legitimate political discourse.\n\u201d At best , this is a direct attempt to minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst , the Republicans \u2019 declaration implies that the US \u2019 s political institutions are fraudulent and that any form of protest \u2014 including insurrection \u2014 is valid .\nThis may get the party votes in the upcoming midterm elections , but it \u2019 ll cost more than money : It \u2019 ll come at the price of further deterioration in public trust .\nFor months , US intelligence had been claiming that Russia intended to invade Ukraine .\nThat the intelligence was right is heartening .\nBut it also raises another question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything to stop it ?\nAmerica still prides itself on being the moral compass of the world , the keeper of the liberal order .\nWhy didn \u2019 t it move to act ?\nWhy didn \u2019 t we rally NATO and its allies to action ?\nOne thing we can deduce from the lack of action is that the plan , probably , was never to stop Russia \u2019 s invasion of Ukraine .\nPresident Joe Biden had long talked up his plan of targeted sanctions and diplomatic pressure .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US and NATO were going to let Ukraine fall and figure out what to do afterward .\nThen Ukrainians started pushing back .\nIn a deeply rousing display of resistance , Ukrainians \u2014 led by a charismatic and direct president \u2014 made the case that they want to join the global liberal dream they \u2019 d heard so much about .\nFar from folding in front of Russian military might , Ukraine \u2019 s people used social media to tell a coherent and deeply moving story of national identity .\nIn essence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a weapon : Here we are , displaying the very values you preach and claim to defend \u2014 freedom , openness , transparency , and national pride \u2014 so will you come to defend us ?\nBut in making the plea , Ukraine exposed a problem with the West .\nIn the 30 years since the fall of the Soviet Union \u2014 nearly my entire lifetime \u2014 liberalism has come to be taken for granted , the will to defend it withered .\nThree decades of not articulating what you stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent years pointing out that the neat story America tells has actually been a lie .\nThe West , so secure in its superior narrative and assuredness that history has ended , has regularly defied some of its own fundamental tenets .\nIt has repeatedly violated state sovereignty ( see : the Iraq War ) .\nIt has overlooked certain crises ( see : Palestine ) in favor of strategic interests .\nAnd it has preached the transformative power of free trade while simultaneously cooking up extraordinary sanctions ( see : Venezuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US may have claimed moral superiority , but Russia needn \u2019 t reach far to poke holes in it .\nSo now the rules-based order stands blemished , facing accusations of hypocrisy from its foes and disappointment from those who saw it as a beacon of hope .\nIf liberalism stands for defending freedom everywhere , it sure isn \u2019 t eager to show it .\nThe immediate consequence of this is another protracted war with no end in sight .\nThe medium term carries uncertainty and danger .\nIt turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys not gone , they may even be winning .\nSome parts of the West do not have the luxury of feeling distance from danger .\nIn the long term , the aftermath of the war in Ukraine means we can no longer tell ourselves the idealistic story that has only barely held up for the last 30 years .\nThe rules-based order that I \u2019 ve understood to be central to the world has been revealed to be ineffectual and incapable of fulfilling its promise .\nIn late February , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia invaded Ukraine , a batch of memes about surviving a pandemic \u201c to be rewarded with World War III \u201d made the rounds , followed by the usual admonishment .\nThis has happened before ( see : the escalating tensions with Iran in January 2020 ) .\nThe panic about memes generally carries the same tone \u2014 that memes are an unserious response to a major event from a generation that does not know how to regard it with the appropriate weight .\nBut consider this : For millennials and younger generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried a reordering of life on every level , from the personal to the global .\nIndividual bonds are changing in the midst of a pandemic .\nThe faint promise of a nation you can trust has waned .\nThere is no obvious immediate , or even distant , way back to the systems that governed us and the contracts that bound us before the pandemic .\nThat world , on every level , is gone .\nSo what \u2019 s next ?\nIn the immediate , more anxiety and disorder .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once had : \u201c How can we cope with the fear , if we can not overcome the causes of the fear ?\n\u201d In the Atlantic , Ed Yong pointed out that recently , there was one day when there were as many people who died of COVID as there were in the entire aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .\nA hundred thousand COVID deaths were deemed a tragedy in 2020 .\nNow , the US is hurtling toward 1 million .\nThis normalization of death is set against the normalization of defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of climate change .\nScientists have perhaps begun to run out of synonyms and journal-approved ways of saying \u201c a lot of people are going to die and life as we know it will change if we don \u2019 t do something about climate change now.\n\u201d On March 23 , 2020 , 12 days after the World Health Organization declared COVID a pandemic , the Harvard Business Review ran a piece titled \u201c The Discomfort You \u2019 re Feeling Is Grief.\n\u201d It immediately went viral .\nOn social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it summed up their inner turmoil and captured a sense that \u201c we are not used to this kind of collective grief in the air.\n\u201d But that feeling was localized , limited to a now-surreal stretch of time when some thought we \u2019 d only have to know terms like \u201c social distancing \u201d and \u201c lockdown \u201d for a brief stint .\nTwo years later , grief has become the air itself .\nWe are simultaneously grieving the former sturdiness of friendships , old relationships to government , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one investment research firm put it in a recent paper , \u201c The risk of Armageddon has risen dramatically .\nStay bullish on stocks over a 12-month horizon.\n\u201d There it is again .\nThat funny feeling .\n\u25cf",

        "content": "Melatonin is famous as the hormone that naturally helps us go to sleep .\nOur bodies usually produce enough to keep us on a normal sleep-wake cycle , but the modern lifestyle of bright screens , late nights , shift work , and time zone\u2013crossing travel leaves many people reaching for over-the-counter melatonin supplements to try to re-create that natural process .\nWhat \u2019 s more , anxiety and sleeplessness caused by the pandemic have had people reaching for melatonin more often too .\nAmericans spent more than $ 1 billion on melatonin in 2021 , a 28 % increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from NielsenIQ .\nAbout 56 % of people said they had COVID-related sleep problems in a 2021 survey conducted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) .\nWhile the natural melatonin produced by the body is best , carefully chosen melatonin supplements may help spur slumber , at least in certain situations .\nHowever , they can have side effects and interact with medications , aren \u2019 t appropriate for all people and circumstances , and need to be taken at the lowest effective dose \u2014 you can definitely take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizziness , nausea , drowsiness , and even elevated blood pressure if you take too much for too long , said Dr. Randall Wright , director of brain wellness and sleep programs at Houston Methodist .\nJust for the record , we \u2019 re also talking about melatonin for adults here .\nMelatonin is not recommended for babies or toddlers , and there are specific guidelines for melatonin use in children .\nThink of melatonin as a key player in your built-in body clock .\nProduced by the brain \u2019 s pineal gland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up and when to sleep , keeping our bodies in sync with the 24-hour day .\n\u201c It works in conjunction with light , \u201d said Dr. Rajkumar Dasgupta , an AASM spokesperson .\n\u201c In the morning , light suppresses the release of melatonin then , at nighttime as the light is going down , melatonin is secreted and hopefully transitions you into some good slumber.\n\u201d That gives sleep a chance to work its magic , rebooting our bodies in preparation for a new 24-hour cycle , Wright said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ use melatonin supplements to address occasional insomnia , which is trouble falling or staying asleep .\nThe scientific evidence , though , isn \u2019 t strong when it comes to using melatonin for that purpose .\nIn one 2020 review of existing studies , melatonin supplements helped people with insomnia but weren \u2019 t as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , which is one of the first treatments you should consider for chronic insomnia .\nCBT involves changing your thoughts and behaviors related to certain issues ( like sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another review , melatonin did seem to help adults 65 or older ( we produce less melatonin as we age ) .\nOverall , though , the AASM has concluded there \u2019 s not enough evidence to support using melatonin for insomnia .\nIf anything , given its short-lasting action , melatonin may help you fall asleep but not necessarily stay asleep , says Dr. Steven H. Feinsilver , director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .\nAnother common use for melatonin supplements is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research does back this up , Feinsilver said .\nIf you want to try melatonin to get your body back on schedule , the AASM recommends starting supplements before you leave on a trip and continuing for a few days after you arrive .\nSmall doses taken before you want to go to sleep should do the trick .\n( More on the correct dosages in a bit . )\nPeople whose days and nights are upside down because they work varying shifts may also benefit from melatonin supplements .\nA 2014 review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 milligrams of melatonin taken after a night shift increased sleep duration by about 24 minutes .\n( The actual dose didn \u2019 t seem to influence the results . )\nHowever , other studies have had mixed results or shown no benefit .\nIf you \u2019 re a shift worker and want to try melatonin , the AASM recommends taking the supplement after getting home in the morning .\nThat way , you won \u2019 t feel drowsy on your drive home .\nScientists have also looked at whether melatonin can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s some evidence to suggest that melatonin may benefit people with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder ( DSWPD ) who fall asleep very late and consequently wake up later in the day .\nIt may also have a role to play in helping folks with REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) , which is when patients act out their dreams while sleeping .\nAn estimated 1 % to 2 % of the population has the condition , which affects older people more than younger ones and men more than women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the studies looking at the impact of melatonin on sleep have been small and have only noted relatively modest gains for these conditions , said Dr. Abhinav Singh , medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center .\nIs melatonin safe ?\nYes , melatonin supplements are safe , at least in the short term : There haven \u2019 t been any long-term ( or large-scale ) studies to say whether it \u2019 s safe to take for more than a month or two .\nWhile safe , melatonin still can have side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even short-term use can cause side effects like daytime drowsiness , headaches , and dizziness , according to a 2019 study on adverse events linked to melatonin .\nMelatonin supplements may also interact with certain medications such as blood thinners , anti-seizure drugs , diabetes medications , and contraceptives .\n\u201c Let your physician know that you \u2019 re taking it , \u201d Dasgupta said .\nPeople who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldn \u2019 t take melatonin .\nNeither should people with dementia , autoimmune diseases , depression , seizure disorders , diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can interact with many medications used to treat these conditions and could aggravate depression in people with a preexisting condition .\nHow much melatonin should you take ?\nIf you \u2019 re going to try melatonin supplements , Dasgupta recommends starting with a low dose ( about 3 mg ) taken two hours before bedtime , although some people need higher or lower amounts .\nIn many studies , researchers use 2 to 5 mg of melatonin , although it can be as high as 10 mg or more , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amount that \u2019 s closest to a 0.3 mg dose of melatonin , according to the AASM .\nIn general , you can buy melatonin in 1 to 10 mg doses , although it \u2019 s not always easy to know how much you are actually taking .\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn \u2019 t regulate dietary supplements the same way as prescription medications , which means you may not know exactly what amount is in an over-the-counter product , Wright said .\nIn fact , in one study of 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most contained wildly variable amounts of melatonin .\nThe dosage varied from lot to lot and between brands , with some containing almost no melatonin and others having a dose much higher than listed .\n( One type of chewable tablet said it contained 1.5 mg but was in fact 9 mg. ) Many also contained serotonin , a mood-altering hormone that \u2019 s a potentially dangerous controlled substance .\nIf you are taking melatonin , look for products that have been independently tested by US Pharmacopeia ( USP ) , ConsumerLab.com , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure the product actually contains melatonin in the dosage listed on the label .\nOral melatonin can start making you drowsy in 30 to 45 minutes , Singh said .\nThat means you should refrain from driving and avoid doing other things that could be dangerous when you are sleepy .\nIt 's best to limit the amount of time you use melatonin , as it really isn \u2019 t indicated for long-term or chronic use .\n\u201c If you find yourself frequently reaching for a bottle of melatonin to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to speak with a sleep specialist or bring this up with your primary care doctor , \u201d Singh said .\nOther ways to get to sleep without using melatonin If you have trouble falling asleep , doctors generally recommend trying nondrug options first .\nFor instance , dimming your lights and shutting off all electronic screens about two hours before bed will cue your body to produce melatonin , Wright said .\nOther \u201c sleep hygiene \u201d practices should be in place to give melatonin a chance .\nThat means : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercise during the day but not before bed \u2022 Keeping your bedroom dark , quiet , and at a comfortable ( cool ) temperature \u2022 Avoiding caffeine ( and fluids in general ) before bed \u2022 Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day \u2022 Banning screens at least 30 minutes before retiring \u201c Dietary supplements should be part of the broader picture , \u201d Dasgupta said .\n\u201c My instinct is to say that melatonin taken at the right time at the right dose will help individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a very potent sleeping aid ?\nProbably not .\n\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former president Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign organization was ordered to pay more than $ 350,000 in legal fees and expenses for trying to enforce an \u201c unenforceable \u201d nondisclosure agreement against former staffer Alva Johnson , according to an order entered this month in a nonpublic arbitration case .\nThe March 10 order , which was made public this week by Johnson \u2019 s attorneys , was the latest setback for the Trump campaign in its effort to use NDAs to try to punish former staffers who publicly criticize or take legal action against Trump .\nAn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s effort to sue Trump failed \u2014 she accused him of trying to forcibly kiss her and raised pay discrimination claims , but the case was tossed out \u2014 the campaign couldn \u2019 t invoke a legally unsound nondisclosure agreement .\nTrump has a history of trying to use arbitration , much of which takes place in private , to try to keep potentially damaging or embarrassing claims out of court , where hearings and documents are generally public .\nWhen he ran for president in 2016 , many campaign workers were reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred them from sharing information about the campaign or saying negative things about Trump , his family , and his businesses ; the agreement specified that the campaign could press complaints about alleged violations of the agreement in arbitration .\nIn two previous cases , though , a judge and an arbitrator concluded that key sections of that agreement were too vague and ill-defined to be constitutionally enforceable .\nThe arbitrator handling Johnson \u2019 s case , Victor Bianchini , a retired federal magistrate judge from California , found those decisions persuasive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson late last year .\nThat left a request by Johnson \u2019 s lawyers to have the campaign pay their legal bills as the winning party .\nBianchini agreed they were entitled to those fees and ordered the campaign to pay $ 303,285 ; the campaign will also have to cover the costs of the arbitration itself , which came to around $ 50,000 .\n\u201c The Trump campaign has tried to use its unenforceable NDA to unlawfully silence its critics , \u201d Johnson \u2019 s lawyer Hassan Zavareei said in a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrator has held that these efforts can not stand and ordered the campaign to compensate our client for the hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that the campaign forced her to incur.\n\u201d Trump spokesperson Liz Harrington provided a statement calling the outcome `` pathetic and totally contrary to the rule of law and any reasonable sense of fairness . ''\n`` After Johnson \u2019 s total defeat , President Trump sought damages for Johnson \u2019 s disgusting lies about him in arbitration .\nBut instead of enforcing a crystal clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson pay for her nasty conduct , Johnson \u2019 s fraud was rewarded with an award of attorneys \u2019 fees .\nAnyone can see that Johnson \u2019 s blatant lies and bad faith conduct completely preclude her from profiting from her illicit conduct , especially after a video revealed that President Trump did nothing wrong , '' Harrington said .\nBianchini described the case as \u201c procedurally tortured \u201d as he recounted the legal twists that led the fight to come before him .\nIn early 2019 , Johnson filed a lawsuit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court \u2014 a public case , unlike the private arbitration .\nJohnson claimed that during a campaign stop in August 2016 , Trump had tried to kiss her .\nIn addition to a battery claim related to the kiss incident , Johnson , who is Black , lodged allegations that she \u2019 d been paid less than other campaign workers because of her gender and race .\nA few months after Johnson filed the lawsuit , the judge dismissed it , finding that it relied too heavily on previous , unrelated allegations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on details about the alleged pay discrimination .\nThe judge gave Johnson an opportunity to refile the lawsuit , explaining that she \u2019 d need to streamline the battery claim and beef up the pay-related parts .\n\u201c As currently stated , the Complaint presents a political lawsuit , not a tort and wages lawsuit .\nPlaintiff will receive a fair day in court , but the Court will try a tort and wages dispute \u2014 not a political one , \u201d US District Judge William Jung wrote at the time .\nShortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump campaign released a video of the campaign stop encounter at the heart of Johnson \u2019 s battery claim .\nIt shows Trump greeting a group of people inside an RV , and as the camera pans to Johnson , the candidate can be seen leaning toward her and giving her a kiss in the area of her cheek as he holds her shoulders .\nJung apparently expressed some concern about whether Johnson \u2019 s battery claim would be viable in light of the footage , according to Bianchini \u2019 s summary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up refiling the case .\nHer lawyers at the time maintained that the video didn \u2019 t clear Trump of wrongdoing \u2014 attorney Zavareei described the scene in a statement to CNN as Trump \u201c grabbing \u201d his client and \u201c pulling her into him \u201d to kiss her in front of others \u2014 but that they \u2019 d decided to drop the case given Jung \u2019 s apparent skepticism and his admonition that she couldn \u2019 t bring in information about past allegations of harassment from others against Trump .\nThe fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn September 2019 , the campaign filed a demand for arbitration that accused Johnson of violating the nondisclosure agreement that she \u2019 d signed .\nWhile the campaign \u2019 s arbitration case against Johnson was pending , two other former Trump campaign staffers \u2014 Jessica Denson and Omarosa Manigault Newman , who also served in the White House for a period of time \u2014 won challenges to NDAs that they \u2019 d signed that were identical to the one at issue in Johnson \u2019 s case .\nDenson prevailed in federal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn November , Bianchini dismissed the campaign \u2019 s arbitration case against Johnson .\nCiting the decisions in Denson and Manigault Newman \u2019 s cases , the arbitrator concluded that the confidentiality and nondisparagement sections of the NDA were \u201c vague and unenforceable.\n\u201d Bianchini quoted sections of those earlier rulings finding that the nondisclosure language could \u201c conceivably cover any information related to the campaign \u201d and had no time limit , and the scope of the nondisparagement language , which appeared to cover potentially hundreds of companies affiliated with Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad .\nJohnson \u2019 s lawyers then filed a petition for the Trump campaign to cover their fees and expenses , totaling around $ 380,000 .\nThe Trump campaign , represented by attorney Justin Clark , opposed the request , arguing that the arbitration and the federal lawsuit that came before it were based on \u201c a politically motivated lie that Respondent shamelessly created and advanced in court and the media.\n\u201d But Bianchini found that the campaign \u2019 s effort to try to punish Johnson for her conduct in the federal case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case she \u2019 d won in arbitration was \u201c misguided and incorrect.\n\u201d The campaign could have pursued its own civil claims against her for malicious prosecution or defamation , he wrote , but they didn \u2019 t , instead trying to enforce parts of an NDA that multiple decision-makers had concluded were invalid .\nThe arbitrator rejected the Trump campaign \u2019 s argument that Johnson and her lawyers had acted in bad faith in their defense against the arbitration complaint .\nHe did reduce the amount that Johnson \u2019 s lawyers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours they \u2019 d claimed were excessive ; he noted that he didn \u2019 t think the tally of hours was dishonest but likely the result of \u201c inefficiency , \u201d and he praised attorneys on both sides for their competence and professionalism .\nThe Trump campaign will also have to cover $ 2,950 in fees to the American Arbitration Association and $ 43,948 to compensate Bianchini for his work on the case .",

        "content": "We hope you love the products we recommend !\nAll of them were independently selected by our editors .\nJust so you know , BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them .\nOh , and FYI \u2014 prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication .\nAlong with many other changes , the pandemic ushered in a new emphasis on at-home exercise equipment \u2014 some of it pretty pricey .\nYes , Peloton was founded in 2012 and the Mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard much about them until spring 2020 , when lockdowns and gym closures meant that most people exercised at home or not at all .\nMore recently , a strength training\u2013focused machine called Tonal has been getting attention , due in part to the company \u2019 s notable lineup of celebrity spokespeople , including Serena Williams , LeBron James , Steph Curry , and Maria Sharapova .\nTonal is basically a digital screen that attaches to your wall ( a professional installation is necessary ) that has an attached pulley system for strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access workout videos , connect with other users , and track your progress .\nAnother reason ( aside from COVID ) that Tonal may be charging into the spotlight is that muscle-building workouts are sweeping through the fitness space at the moment .\n\u201c Whether it 's body composition , athletic performance , or even endurance athletes , I always just tell people strength is kind of like the foundation or base for pretty much everything , \u201d said Tony Gentilcore , cofounder of Cressey Sports Performance , which is a high-performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance athletes , like his clients who are interested in running the Boston Marathon , Gentilcore advises strength training to help them put more force into the ground and propel forward .\nStrength training can be intimidating for a beginner , especially at the gym or without a personal trainer offering guidance .\nWhile the Tonal sounds like a good idea \u2014 who wouldn \u2019 t want to try the machine that Serena Williams supposedly uses to train ?\n\u2014 is it really worth $ 3,000 or more to do so ?\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTonal addresses those deterrents in what I genuinely believe to be one of the most compact home workout formats I \u2019 ve seen , which could be really useful for people who have small spaces or live in smaller homes .\nI visited their Fifth Avenue showroom in NYC for a demo , which anyone can do at no cost if there \u2019 s a nearby location .\n( Tonal is now available at 40 Nordstrom retail stores in 24 states nationwide . )\nYou can also check it out via a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical locations near you ( or you \u2019 d just prefer to do it at home ) .\nI \u2019 d recommend the in-person experience if possible since adjusting the arms and attaching the smart accessories for the strength assessment can be tricky to figure out on your own .\nAside from the price point , my biggest concern about Tonal is the potential difficulty of navigating the equipment and interface .\nIt is not impossible .\nBut as with any technology , there will likely be a learning curve .\nHow much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a mounted mirrorlike touchscreen display with an adjustable arm on either side ( for $ 2,995 ) .\nThe arms remain flush with the screen when they \u2019 re not in use , so it really does just look like a fancy mirror you might see on any wall in your home .\nThat being said , the screen alone is relatively pointless unless you purchase the smart accessories bundle , which is an extra $ 495 .\nThe bundle includes two smart handles , a smart bar , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one or both of the arms and allow the machine to adjust the weight based on your own personal strength .\nIt also includes a bench , foam roller , and workout mat .\nWithout these accessories , I don \u2019 t see how you could get a tailored experience ; it would just be a screen that projects workout videos .\nThe bench is fairly slim and can sit under the machine without taking up too much additional space , while the rest of the accessories can hang from a sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the wall as the screen .\nOn top of that , delivery with professional installation ( which is required for the warranty ) is $ 250 , and the Tonal membership that gives you unlimited access to the full library of workouts is another $ 49 per month and it 's mandatory for the first 12 months .\nWhile the device is relatively compact , you still need 7 feet of vertical and horizontal space to install it and a 7-foot-10-inch ceiling height .\nAlso necessary is a grounded three-prong outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150-pound device .\n( Tonal is able to generate up to 200 pounds of resistance by using an electric motor . )\nThere \u2019 s no doubt that the equipment and membership add up to a lot of money .\nHere \u2019 s why you might want a Tonal The thing is , my brother just turned his suburban basement into a home gym , which takes up about 10 times the space with 20 times the pieces of equipment .\n( He bought a bench press with various weights , Bowflex adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mini treadmill , just to name a few . )\nA full home gym probably costs just as much if not more money than a Tonal .\nNot everyone has the space to fill a whole room with workout gear , the time to go to a gym four to five days a week , or the ability to hire a trainer to learn how to use the equipment and help keep you motivated .\nOne of the best perks of using Tonal , in my opinion , is that it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger , but that it also tracks your progress from the privacy of your own home .\nEach member of the household can set up their own profile and conduct a personalized strength assessment to establish their starting point .\nThat allows the machine to set an optimal weight for every single one of the 200 moves you can do on this one machine ( as long as you have the smart accessories , that is ) , ensuring that you \u2019 re maximizing each exercise without pushing yourself too far .\nEach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to activate and deactivate the weight \u2014 so if you \u2019 re struggling , you can simply press it and all weight will be released .\nWhile a maximum resistance of 200 pounds may not be enough for the weightlifting pros , it should be plenty for beginner to intermediate exercisers .\nWith the membership , you can also access from anywhere the videos on the app , which include everything from strength training to yoga to guided Theragun sessions that don \u2019 t require the Tonal equipment .\nScrolling through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generally easy and intuitive , though , even with the video guidance , it took a few tries for me to adjust the arms to the proper positions .\nThe Spotter technology monitors for signs of stress or fatigue and automatically decreases the weight if you are struggling , while 17 sensors provide direction on form and technique .\nAfter my guided strength assessment and completing one 15-minute , full-body workout video , I felt confident that I \u2019 d be able to do it all on my own and master the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout only used the smart bar and bodyweight to complete exercises like Romanian deadlifts , bent-over rows , weighted squats , and burpees .\nBecause my lower body is significantly stronger than my upper body , the smart bar was much heavier during my deadlifts and lightened up for the bent-over rows .\nBy the end , I felt sufficiently engaged , challenged , and excited to see my strength score creep up ever so slightly .\nIf you \u2019 re more experienced and prefer to choose your own moves , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your music service of choice to play your favorite soundtrack while you do it .\nTo help motivate you even further , you can connect your Tonal account with those of friends or family members to compare progress or even see where you stand among all Tonal users across the country .\nFull disclosure , at this moment in time and place in my life , I \u2019 m not willing to make the monetary investment that a Tonal requires .\nBut that \u2019 s not to say I don \u2019 t see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2019 re unable to find another way to exercise .\nIf I lived farther from workout facilities , or had a family or work lifestyle that didn \u2019 t allow me the time to practice strength training in another context , I would definitely consider Tonal over the other at-home workout machines at this price point .\nOne other factor : I live in an apartment , and permanently attaching a heavy device to a wall could make it tricky to move at some point in the future .\n( Tonal will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\nThat said , it \u2019 s truly all you need in one relatively compact , impressively high-tech , and customizable machine .\nYou can buy the full Tonal system starting at $ 2,995 .",

        "content": "For months , Jaylin Scott had picked at her armpits .\nShe would dig at her skin any time of the day \u2014 even in her sleep \u2014 until it bled and burned .\nThese episodes would make her scream and cry in pain , drained by the compulsion to level out her skin .\n\u201c In my mind I \u2019 m screaming at myself to stop picking , stop picking , but I just couldn \u2019 t , \u201d Scott said .\n\u201c I had to have someone physically pull my arm away.\n\u201d The dry heat where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intense , but she couldn \u2019 t wear deodorant because picking made her skin raw , so she constantly worried about body odor , too .\n\u201c It felt really shameful , \u201d Scott said .\n\u201c I became disgusted with myself.\n\u201d Then she found videos on TikTok about people struggling with the same thing , which made her feel seen .\nThat was the first time she \u2019 d heard about skin picking disorder , a mental illness related to obsessive compulsive disorder that involves repeatedly picking at skin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical damage .\nAbout six months ago , a dermatologist finally diagnosed her with the condition and prescribed an ointment called triamcinolone acetonide .\nThe medication healed the scabs that formed in her armpits , which helped Scott avoid the urge to pick at her skin , a feeling many with the condition experience due to emotional and physical factors .\nReceiving a diagnosis helped her immensely ; now Scott is in recovery and has joined the many people with the illness who have posted about their journey on TikTok .\n\u201c Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a TikTok caption in August 2021 .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve kept this a secret for a long time and i feel it \u2019 s time to share my journey so others don \u2019 t feel alone !\n\u201d Skin picking disorder affects as many as 1 in 20 people and is a form of self-soothing to handle emotional distress .\nIt was informally called dermatillomania ( a term still commonly used ) or compulsive skin picking until 2013 , when it was classified as excoriation disorder by the American Psychiatric Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) .\nResearch on the disorder is in its \u201c infancy , \u201d but awareness around the illness has grown , especially in the past five years , according to Karen Pickett , a licensed psychotherapist in California who has researched the condition for 20 years .\nThe disorder goes far beyond popping pimples or removing dry skin .\nIt can cause conspicuous lesions on the body .\nPeople with the disorder often miss out on normal life or suffer emotional distress because of the compulsion .\nPickett said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to stop and seek the satisfaction of checking the skin for areas to work at .\nThe behavior sets off synapses that produce dopamine and endorphin hits in the brain .\n\u201c Skin pickers can talk about the \u2018 reward \u2019 as a feeling of accomplishment or relief or a way to self-soothe , \u201d Pickett said .\nAccording to Lauren McKeaney , CEO and founder of the Chicago-based Picking Me Foundation , triggers depend on the person but can be anything from a stressful day to a comment about your appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scanning , a process of unconsciously searching the skin for something to smooth out , or focused picking , honing in on a perceived imperfection for an extended period of time before \u201c coming to \u201d and realizing what damage has been done , McKeaney said .\nShe likened skin picking to an unavoidable \u201c signal \u201d from the body about an emotional state ; to find a solution to picking , it \u2019 s important to recognize the emotion behind the behavior , she said .\nBased on research about closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 % of people with skin picking disorders have other psychological conditions , such as depression , because of its emotional regulation component .\nLauren Brown , 26 , said she thinks her family \u2019 s history of addiction and depression , and her own \u201c addictive personality , \u201d set her up to potentially have dermatillomania .\nFor her , skin picking was a normal habit exacerbated to dangerous levels by a change in her environment .\nBrown , who wrote a memoir about anxiety and skin picking called Hands , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to a new city and felt lonely .\nAfter a while , she couldn \u2019 t resist looking at herself in the mirror for extended periods of time , picking at her skin , and savoring the reward of clearing perceived irregularities .\nIt \u2019 s hard to explain to someone who doesn \u2019 t have the disorder , she said , but she felt a sense of \u201c achievement.\n\u201d \u201c You think , It \u2019 s just a habit and I can stop whenever I want , \u201d Brown said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated by a sense of wanting to improve skin or a desire to release a feeling .\nFor her , she wanted to get away from negative feelings about her new life .\nAfter picking , the emotions would briefly go away , but then she \u2019 d be jolted back into reality .\n\u201c You go into this mindless state of almost enjoyment .\n\u2026 You all of a sudden wake up to realize time has passed \u2014 that can be a shocking moment , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Skin picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through uncomfortable thoughts and feelings , \u201d Pickett said , adding that skin picking is a common way for someone to deal with difficult emotions if they are already in recovery from another mental illness .\nOne emotional regulator replaces another .\nFor McKeaney , it was a way to pacify herself any time she felt too anxious or excited .\n\u201c It really developed into a repetitive ingrained behavior I used to regulate stimuli , \u201d she said .\nThe disorder affected many of her childhood experiences ; she quit figure skating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healing scabs on her legs made it difficult to pull her tights off .\nShe couldn \u2019 t stay the night at a friend \u2019 s house out of fear she \u2019 d have a picking episode ; her parents only allowed her to have black bedsheets because they masked the little blood marks she \u2019 d leave in her sleep .\nA lot of what is known about skin picking disorder is based on research on the closely related trichotillomania , or hair pulling disorder , which is also a body-focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may pull their hair or pick at their skin for similar emotional reasons , or even do both things , so scientists study the disorders closely .\nOne 2006 study concerning trichotillomania concluded that two mutations in the SLITRK1 gene were linked to hair-pulling disorder .\nGiven the similarities of hair pulling and skin picking disorders , Pickett said it \u2019 s possible to assume that a genetic marker may cause skin picking disorder , too , although she said no research has pinpointed one yet .\nPickett said she works with parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving \u201d it to their children .\nSimone Kolysh , 38 , a sociologist based in Maryland , has noticed their 15-year-old son is scratching on his shoulders and arms , the same areas they do .\nThey point it out to him and provide a fidget toy to replace the urge to pick , without trying to make a big deal about it .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a lot kinder to my kids than I am to myself , \u201d said Kolysh , who has four children and said seeing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them feel ashamed and blame themself for his behavior .\nHow the pandemic raised awareness of skin picking disorder The pandemic was a pressure cooker for many people with skin picking disorder , Pickett , the psychotherapist , said .\nSome people with dermatillomania who spoke with BuzzFeed News said the pandemic exacerbated their anxiety and depression , leading them to double down on their behaviors in search of some form of relief .\nLockdown meant there was also a reduced likelihood of other people seeing their skin .\nMcKeaney of the Picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin when she was 5 years old .\nHer body is covered in scars from sores she created as a child \u201c anywhere [ her ] hands could reach , \u201d she told BuzzFeed News .\nNow 35 and in recovery , McKeaney said the pandemic was triggering ; suddenly the CDC was saying \u201c Don \u2019 t touch your face , \u201d something her parents used to say to stop her picking .\nBut more time in front of the mirror also meant new opportunities for self-reflection , she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the pandemic of people seeking support from the organization .\nAs people were isolated and experienced uncertainty during the pandemic , interest in understanding these symptoms increased : Google Trends shows a growth in queries in the US for \u201c dermatillomania \u201d and \u201c skin picking \u201d after spring 2020 .\nNow an otherwise little-known community is speaking up : Advocacy organizations , bots , apps , TikTokers , and Instagram accounts are spreading awareness about the disorder , debunking myths , sharing personal experiences , and offering support and resources .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin on his palms since June 27 , 2020 .\nThe 18-year-old first-year student at Brooklyn College , who is autistic , started creating lesions on their hands around the age of 5 as a form of stimming , a term that refers to self-calming behaviors .\nHe couldn \u2019 t stop , sometimes targeting the area for 30 minutes at a time .\nEmbarrassed by the look of their palms , which became red and raw from the picking , Jeanfrancois avoided giving high fives or would position his hand so only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first summer of the pandemic , Jeanfrancois decided to make a change .\nHis mother had told him that when she was younger , she had picked her skin too , and her recovery motivated him to try to stop .\nBy focusing on other actions such as meditating , playing video games , or exercising , Jeanfrancois has been able to fill the gap .\nThey have since posted about his disorder on TikTok , sharing how he stopped picking and achieved significant recovery milestones .\nJennifer Hollander , a nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plastic & Laser Surgery , helps hundreds of patients nationally with cosmetic skin concerns and said people rarely know they have skin picking disorder when they come to her .\n\u201c I would say it \u2019 s underreported because there \u2019 s a lot of shame around it , \u201d Hollander said , adding she \u2019 s seen an \u201c uptick \u201d in patients with skin picking disorder and is treating them \u201c now more than ever.\n\u201d But she focuses on having a conversation with patients about how common the condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell if a patient has skin picking disorder or another skin condition , such as acne , because picking creates \u201c secondary \u201d wounds on top of those caused by other conditions .\nBecause medical research into the disorder is lacking , she said , she \u2019 s glad to be able to connect patients with support groups or share her expertise on social media .\nTalking about the condition , both with their family and online , has helped a lot , said Kolysh .\n\u201c Once I started posting pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , I got a bit more of a handle on it , \u201d they said .\n\u201c I became more in control of the behavior because I brought it into my conscious sphere out of my subconscious.\n\u201d \u201c Talking about it and sharing photos of my skin and not blurring it out or editing it helped normalize it , \u201d they added .\nMany of the people who are publicly sharing their experiences with skin picking disorder are white women like herself , said Pickett , the psychotherapist .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely to seek out therapy in the US than other groups .\nAnother is that while Black and other nonwhite groups may experience more emotional trauma than white people , there \u2019 s a gap in receiving a diagnosis or getting therapy , according to Mental Health America .\n( In 2018 , over half of Black and African American adults with a serious mental illness did not receive treatment . )\nJeanfrancois , who is Black and bisexual , said he is inspired to spread awareness about skin picking disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is especially important , he said , because symptoms like bloody wounds show differently on nonwhite bodies .\nScott , who is Black , said the disorder resurfaced existing insecurities about her skin color .\nBefore she started picking at her armpits , she said , she was already self-conscious about the area because of dark spots caused by shaving , something Black women experience due to higher melanin levels .\n\u201c White women are overrepresented in the research , \u201d Pickett said .\n\u201c Hopefully that will change with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s like to have skin picking disorder Skin picking disorder is complex because it feels good in the moment , but shame and remorse often follow .\nScarlett , 20 , an online personal coach in Northamptonshire , England , is in recovery from depression and an eating disorder but has struggled with skin picking since she was 12 .\nSkin picking served as a way for her to avoid self-harm caused by depression or deal with emotions she had after eating .\nScarlett ( who did not want her last name mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid saying \u201c stop picking your skin \u201d or \u201c your skin is looking better \u201d to those with the disorder .\n\u201c [ If ] someone [ mentions ] anything to do with my skin \u2026 I end up just making it worse , \u201d she said , adding that comments like these fail to address the root of the behavior , and sometimes compel her to focus even more on her face .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just understanding that it 's difficult to not do it.\n\u201d Pickett added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin picking disorder largely because of lack of information .\nIt \u2019 s not their fault.\n\u201d \u201c That \u2019 s the inner conflict \u2014 I want to skin pick and I want to stop , \u201d Pickett said .\nWhen she treats people , she talks about the behavior , its \u201c addictive quality , \u201d the emotional regulation needed to calm her brain , how to stop , and finding other techniques for dealing with thoughts and feelings .\nPickett said it \u2019 s not clear to researchers how the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but self-reported data shows that it can be a form of the mind soothing itself .\nShe said that the disorder is a pendulum of reward and shame : \u201c You feel bad about yourself , and it precipitates all these emotions , which you then deal with via the behavior .\n\u2026 Breaking that cycle can be quite difficult.\n\u201d Kim Mills , a 29-year-old creator who posts on TikTok and Instagram as Kim on Skin , bit her nails as a child , and after puberty that evolved into skin picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d she said , and she got frustrated that she wasn \u2019 t growing out of it .\nShe \u2019 d give herself goals \u2014 once she got a boyfriend or her first apartment , she would stop picking \u2014 but the end never came .\nIt was isolating .\n\u201c I felt like people around me only knew a certain side of me , \u201d Mills said .\n\u201c I felt like friends and family didn \u2019 t really know me.\n\u201d Mills now hosts Dermatillo-Diaries : The BFRB Podcast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and promotes products like Nudge , a wristband device for skin pickers that vibrates and lights up whenever someone raises their hands to their face or head .\n( Mills said the Nudge device has been out of stock since the start of the pandemic , but the company declined BuzzFeed News \u2019 request for comment on when it plans to restock . )\nHow to manage skin picking and get help There \u2019 s no single way a doctor may approach treating someone for skin picking disorder .\nAwareness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution is different for every person .\nSome medical providers may prescribe an ointment like Scott received , while others may send a patient to a therapist for a mental health evaluation .\nMcKeaney of the Picking Me Foundation said she creates information packets to send to physicians \u2014 who are often the first point of contact with someone with dermatillomania \u2014 and a directory of informed medical providers .\nHollander , the nurse practitioner , gives patients the foundation \u2019 s \u201c fiddle packs , \u201d which include tools to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their body .\nShe said she can \u2019 t speak for the whole medical community but noted that her nursing background gives her a \u201c holistic \u201d approach to skin picking disorder that focuses on the emotional factors behind a skin problem ; she also refers patients with skin picking disorder to a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy , which provides people with ways to approach specific behaviors in the moment .\nMany skin pickers feel like they \u2019 re the only people doing it .\nBut the Picking Me Foundation has run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has grown from three attendees to about 40 per meeting .\nThe foundation now has over 800 members , and its email list has doubled in size since the start of the pandemic .\nMills said she had trouble finding useful forums or treatments on her own when she started her recovery three years ago , prompting her to make social media content as Kim on Skin to help others feel seen and learn more about skin picking disorder herself .\nShe started her recovery by tracking her triggers , writing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episodes were , and how these might be connected to other events that day .\nThere \u2019 s even an app she used for this purpose called SkinPick , which provides a self-monitoring tool and a four-week course to help people understand and reduce their skin picking .\nAfter gathering this data , Mills noticed that job stresses were often behind her picking , so she pivoted from a career in finance to one in social media .\nShe now has a full-time job but hopes to eventually focus full time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important it is to not downplay someone \u2019 s skin picking as only a habit .\n\u201c Then they \u2019 re back to square one , \u201d she said , \u201c feeling embarrassed and even more alone.\n\u201d Investing time in recovery is also not something that may come naturally to people with dermatillomania , Mills said .\n\u201c A large majority are struggling with providing self-care , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Because of that , a big investment into themselves , that 's really hard for people to justify.\n\u201d Self-managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers .\nFor McKeaney , avoiding mirrors is important .\nShe splashes water on the sink in her bathroom so she won \u2019 t bring her face close to the mirror .\nShe also leaves the lights off , keeps the door open , puts a tape boundary on the floor , uses acrylic nails ( which are less sharp on skin ) , and wears pimple patches to hide areas she would be tempted to pick .\nScarlett , the personal coach in England , manages her picking by going on walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom , and covering up mirrors with towels .\nShe spoke out on TikTok about skin picking and connects via DMs with others who do it , which makes her feel less alone .\nShe said her skin picking has become less intense with each little change .\nIn July 2020 , she decided to enter a bodybuilding competition ; knowing the event was coming up served as a reminder to hold back from skin picking .\nPickett \u2019 s advice for anyone who encounters a friend or relative with skin picking disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options , and other resources from the TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors , and then ask them if they \u2019 ve heard of the disorder and if they think it might be something they have .\nThis avoids any sense of blame or shame , as if they \u2019 ve done something they should be embarrassed about .\n\u201c For anyone who is struggling , I ask them to be as gentle with themselves , \u201d McKeaney said .\n\u201c This disorder already tears us apart and does n't deserve another minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of our Body Week series .\nTo read more , click here .",

        "content": "\u201c Once they \u2019 re done and you see it , it \u2019 s very emotional\u2026 I guess I didn \u2019 t think that I would feel completely restored again.\n\u201d Carole Wymer was 47 in 2011 , the year she received her breast cancer diagnosis .\nDoctors said they could remove the tumor from her left breast with a simple lumpectomy , and she felt relatively optimistic .\nBut after her follow-up appointment , she received some bad news : There was a second tumor nested behind the first .\nThe doctors recommended that she have at least her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second tumor meant there was an increased risk that the cancer would spread , so they also broached the idea of a bilateral mastectomy .\nThat idea felt like a much bigger deal to Wymer , who lives in Tucson , Arizona .\nShe wouldn \u2019 t just be carving out the sickness and moving on .\nShe was going to lose a whole element of her body \u2014 one that had fed her two children as babies , and which she now realized felt like part of her identity .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the emotional connection to my femininity and to my self-identity as a mother\u2026 it felt like it was being sacrificed , \u201d she said .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t separate your heart from your body , or your emotions from your body .\nThey \u2019 re all woven together.\n\u201d Still , she decided to have both breasts removed .\nThe prospect of the surgeries and treatments to come was overwhelming , but she just tried to look ahead and keep it together .\nAfter the multi-surgery reconstruction , she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to going out in public .\nBut it was disconcerting to see \u201c blank mounds \u201d on her chest .\nThe surgeon had created a small bump atop each reconstructed breast to represent a nipple , but the bumps were colorless and had no areolas .\nFrom a distance , they weren \u2019 t clearly visible .\nAccording to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons , more than 137,000 people had breast reconstruction surgery in 2020 .\nIt \u2019 s possible for mastectomies to preserve the nipple , but depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , as well as breast size , this is less feasible for some candidates .\nAnother option is to create a nipple out of tissue in a separate surgery , but it usually flattens over time .\nRadiated skin can also make both options riskier .\nThat \u2019 s why many patients do what Wymer did in 2017 : Visit a tattoo artist who specializes in photorealistic 3D nipple tattoos .\nThrough a cancer support group , Wymer heard about Vinnie Myers , an artist based in Finksburg , Maryland , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a visit .\nMyers mapped out a location for the tattoos , explaining how he would camouflage the makeshift bumps created by her surgeon , which had moved since the operation .\nThey even shared a laugh while he mixed inks into just the right shade and set to work .\nThe appointment didn \u2019 t last more than an hour and a half , but the effects were both striking and permanent .\nLooking at her tattoos for the first time was , Wymer said , like seeing the final period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to describe , but you feel complete again , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Even though they \u2019 re just tattoos , there \u2019 s some sense of normalcy back.\n\u201d Nipple reconstruction does not change the size or sensitivity of the breast .\nBut a 2017 study in the Journal of Plastic , Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery seemed to point to the psychological benefits of such procedures ; it found that patients who had their nipples reconstructed were more satisfied with the size and sensitivity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance .\nTattooing is a nonsurgical option that offers many survivors the same benefits .\nPlus , nipple reconstruction surgery can cost thousands of dollars , while nipple tattoos usually cost less than $ 1,000 .\nA 2018 study found that , after receiving nipple tattoos , breast cancer survivors were not only more satisfied with their breasts , but also reported better sexual and psychosocial well-being .\nMyers , Wymer \u2019 s tattoo artist , estimates that he \u2019 s done tattoos for about 12,000 women over the past 20 years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians and a nurse reporting on the benefits of the tattooing technique in 2014 .\nHe said the feedback he hears from clients most often is that they finally feel like themselves again , or that they feel whole .\nCancer comes with a lot of waiting rooms , bureaucracy , taking clothes off in front of strangers , keeping track of medications , and information overload about potential treatment plans : a mastectomy or a lumpectomy ?\nWill you do chemotherapy before or after surgery , and what kind ?\nTamoxifen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in what combination ?\nAs one survivor put it to me , \u201c When you get the diagnosis , you hear nothing after that except Wahwahwahwahwah.\n\u201d Reconstruction involves another slew of surgeries , and everything about it is dependent on the patient \u2019 s particular case .\nThere \u2019 s the actual mastectomy and healing .\nThen the surgeon installs expanders to stretch the skin , filling them until there \u2019 s enough room to either insert implants or tissue from other parts of the body ( this can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or fat from the stomach , buttocks , or thighs , depending on the patient \u2019 s body type , cancer type , and personal preference ) .\nRadiated skin is more resistant to stretching , so that \u2019 s another complicating factor .\nBy the end , some survivors are so exhausted by the experience that they don \u2019 t want to deal with the thought of nipples \u2014 having reconstructed breasts that look standard when clothed might feel like enough .\nAt first , that was the case for Kris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas .\nBova had her mastectomies and reconstruction in 2012 , when she was 51 .\nAt every follow-up appointment , her doctor would ask , \u201c What are we doing about nipples ?\n\u201d Bova would brush him off .\n\u201c Nobody else was going to see it but me and my husband , \u201d Bova said .\n\u201c I just didn \u2019 t think it was necessary .\nIt \u2019 s not like a baby needs to find it.\n\u201d Eventually , her doctor asked enough times that Bova went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Artistic Touch , a permanent cosmetics business based in Tucson , Arizona .\nThe procedure wasn \u2019 t covered by her insurance , but , with Bova \u2019 s chest still largely numb , the pain wouldn \u2019 t be a problem .\nWhen she decided to go for it , she was shocked by how much of a difference the tattooed nipples made to her reconstructed breasts .\n\u201c [ It was ] like they were breasts in my clothing , but when I looked at myself in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d she said of her pre-tattoo chest .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t have the anatomical markings of a breast .\nOnce [ the nipples ] were back , you feel more complete , more whole , more normal .\nBut I didn \u2019 t realize I didn \u2019 t feel normal.\n\u201d Mary Ellen Gonzalez , who lives in Eastvale , California , received her diagnosis in 2015 at age 36 .\nShe had her tattoos done at the end of a long road that included chemotherapy , multiple surgeries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nDuring that time , she wore prosthetics when her skin wasn \u2019 t too sensitive from radiation to handle them .\nBut there were moments of frustration \u2014 like when she \u2019 d be getting ready to go out and end up looking all over the house for her \u201c boobs.\n\u201d When she eventually had her reconstruction , she said it was a relief , but still just felt \u201c weird.\n\u201d \u201c When you \u2019 re rebuilt and see all the scars , and you don \u2019 t see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Once they \u2019 re done and you see it , it \u2019 s very emotional .\nIt \u2019 s like , \u2018 Wow !\n\u2019 I guess I didn \u2019 t think that I would feel completely restored again.\n\u201d Kathleen Ashton , PhD , director of behavioral health for the Cleveland Clinic Breast Center , said that body image issues are common in women with breast cancer , who can face everything from hair loss to weight gain to scarring .\nIn her work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often hears women describe their bodies using words like \u201c mutilated \u201d and \u201c not whole.\n\u201d Scars or the absence of nipples can visually remind patients about their own powerlessness in the face of cancer , so these tattoos can be a visual representation of moving forward .\n\u201c With tattooing , you \u2019 re also talking about something the patient is choosing to do , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The mastectomy , or the scarring from the surgery , isn \u2019 t something that \u2019 s often their choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel ownership and be empowered is a huge psychological advantage.\n\u201d Elizabeth ( who requested a pseudonym for privacy reasons ) had her reconstruction done in 2008 , after an initial diagnosis in 2005 and years of treatments and surgeries .\nHer surgeon used skin grafting to create 3D nipples , but they weren \u2019 t colored .\n\u201c My breasts , right before I went through all my breast cancer and surgeries , were probably one of the nicest parts of my body , \u201d she said .\n\u201c A part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then they were replaced with something that wasn \u2019 t real\u2026 And I \u2019 m a real person , you know ?\nSo for me to get implants , it was \u2014 all of this was \u2014 hard for me.\n\u201d When Myers did her nipple tattoos in 2015 , it was the first time Elizabeth had ever been in a tattoo parlor .\nMyers wore a bowler hat , wingtip shoes , and a smile that left her at ease .\nShe remembers a map hanging on the wall covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world .\nAfter she had her implants replaced at her surgeon \u2019 s suggestion in 2021 , she went back to see him for a touchup ; he didn \u2019 t charge her for it .\n\u201c It takes a certain individual to do this , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The calmness , the empathy that he has , it \u2019 s amazing.\n\u201d For tattoo artists , this kind of work comes with its own set of challenges and emotions .\nFor one , it requires skill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D image on a blank slate .\nOthers involve coloring a \u201c nipple \u201d created by a surgeon and adding an areola , or trying to cover up a makeshift nipple that has migrated over time .\nSome clients have scarred skin , radiation burns , or breasts of different sizes .\nOthers come in for corrections or coverups after originally having had their tattoos done somewhere else .\nColors must be mixed to get the shade just right .\nMany clients are in their 50s or 60s and bring pictures of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after reconstruction , their breasts are much perkier , so the nipples need to match .\nTattoo artists also mentioned the importance of including imperfections ; in order to look lifelike , no two nipples should be exactly the same .\nEach artist must also learn to carefully and courteously approach appointments with cancer survivors , who have already been through the wringer .\nSetting the atmosphere is a delicate balance .\nArtists don \u2019 t want clients to feel like they \u2019 re in another doctor \u2019 s office , with clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel everywhere .\nMyers , who is 59 , originally specialized in photorealistic tattoos and opened his own shop in 1991 .\nIn 2002 , he met a plastic surgeon \u2019 s office manager who said they were looking for someone to do nipple tattoos for breast reconstruction patients .\nIt quickly became Myers \u2019 specialty .\nMany of his clients say they never dreamed they \u2019 d be getting a tattoo and that they told their children for years to never get tattoos \u2014 but there they were .\n\u201c You end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , \u201d Myers said .\n\u201c If you do this work exclusively , and it \u2019 s all you do , it will definitely change you as a person .\nThere \u2019 s no question.\n\u201d Valerie Polson , owner and operator of Forever Fabulous in Tucson , told me a favorite client story : One woman said that when she \u2019 d seen her tattooed breasts in the mirror after showering , she had actually felt naked for the first time since her reconstruction .\nUnlike Myers , Polson came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades as an operating room nurse , watching patients \u2019 journeys from diagnosis through reconstruction .\n\u201c I was always fascinated with the end of it .\nAnd having learned about that 3D nipple process , I guess I always thought of it as the cherry on top of everything , literally , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Everything about it is emotional , and I think this part of the process is [ clients ] kind of feeling like , \u2018 I made it.\n\u2019 \u201d At these appointments , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is catharsis .\nAnd there are even opportunities to be creative .\nOne woman who had had her left breast removed and reconstructed told her friends that cancer had broken her heart .\nTo commemorate what she \u2019 d lost , she asked Polson to tattoo her areola in the shape of a heart .\nPichet , Bova \u2019 s tattoo artist , said that her job is \u201c extraordinary.\n\u201d Years of seeing the impact these tattoos have on her clients meant that she was able to find comfort when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own a few years ago .\nShe would reach down and move her hands over her breasts as though she was tattooing her own nipples .\n\u201c That helped me through the scare , while I was waiting for the results and everything , \u201d she said .\n\u201c And I remember that gesture was enough to bring me solace.\n\u201d Myers said that when he \u2019 s asking clients to approve the color and size before he starts tattooing , some say they don \u2019 t care very much , that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway .\nHe makes sure to push back .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter who else sees it , \u201d he said .\n\u201c You \u2019 re the important one .\nYou \u2019 re looking in the mirror every day .\nSo , is this color going to be OK when you look at it every single day ?\nBecause I want it to be perfect.\n\u201d Others are excited to show their partners or find themselves more confident about hitting the dating scene .\nAnd some find that this symbolic end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them or their partners , but also for their families and loved ones who felt the ripple effects of cancer .\nWymer , who said losing her breasts had made her feel disconnected from her femininity , spent over five years without nipples after her reconstruction .\nShe \u2019 d been busy with work and with leading fitness classes for a local cancer support group .\nPlus , Myers \u2019 Maryland shop was quite a distance from her home in Arizona .\nWhen she heard Myers was making a visit to San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go together , making a road trip she said was healing for both of them .\nIn the early days of her diagnosis , her then-teenage son had struggled to manage and wanted no part in anything that had to do with cancer .\nNow , they were driving to California and laughing about her boobs .\nWhen they stopped for lunch on the drive back home , he offered to stand guard outside the bathroom door of a Chipotle while Wymer applied moisturizing ointment to her tattoos .\n\u201c I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , \u2018 Well , we \u2019 ve come a long way , certainly , from where we began.\n\u2019 \u201d \u25cf",

        "content": "Melatonin is famous as the hormone that naturally helps us go to sleep .\nOur bodies usually produce enough to keep us on a normal sleep-wake cycle , but the modern lifestyle of bright screens , late nights , shift work , and time zone\u2013crossing travel leaves many people reaching for over-the-counter melatonin supplements to try to re-create that natural process .\nWhat \u2019 s more , anxiety and sleeplessness caused by the pandemic have had people reaching for melatonin more often too .\nAmericans spent more than $ 1 billion on melatonin in 2021 , a 28 % increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from NielsenIQ .\nAbout 56 % of people said they had COVID-related sleep problems in a 2021 survey conducted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) .\nWhile the natural melatonin produced by the body is best , carefully chosen melatonin supplements may help spur slumber , at least in certain situations .\nHowever , they can have side effects and interact with medications , aren \u2019 t appropriate for all people and circumstances , and need to be taken at the lowest effective dose \u2014 you can definitely take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizziness , nausea , drowsiness , and even elevated blood pressure if you take too much for too long , said Dr. Randall Wright , director of brain wellness and sleep programs at Houston Methodist .\nJust for the record , we \u2019 re also talking about melatonin for adults here .\nMelatonin is not recommended for babies or toddlers , and there are specific guidelines for melatonin use in children .\nThink of melatonin as a key player in your built-in body clock .\nProduced by the brain \u2019 s pineal gland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up and when to sleep , keeping our bodies in sync with the 24-hour day .\n\u201c It works in conjunction with light , \u201d said Dr. Rajkumar Dasgupta , an AASM spokesperson .\n\u201c In the morning , light suppresses the release of melatonin then , at nighttime as the light is going down , melatonin is secreted and hopefully transitions you into some good slumber.\n\u201d That gives sleep a chance to work its magic , rebooting our bodies in preparation for a new 24-hour cycle , Wright said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ use melatonin supplements to address occasional insomnia , which is trouble falling or staying asleep .\nThe scientific evidence , though , isn \u2019 t strong when it comes to using melatonin for that purpose .\nIn one 2020 review of existing studies , melatonin supplements helped people with insomnia but weren \u2019 t as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , which is one of the first treatments you should consider for chronic insomnia .\nCBT involves changing your thoughts and behaviors related to certain issues ( like sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another review , melatonin did seem to help adults 65 or older ( we produce less melatonin as we age ) .\nOverall , though , the AASM has concluded there \u2019 s not enough evidence to support using melatonin for insomnia .\nIf anything , given its short-lasting action , melatonin may help you fall asleep but not necessarily stay asleep , says Dr. Steven H. Feinsilver , director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .\nAnother common use for melatonin supplements is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research does back this up , Feinsilver said .\nIf you want to try melatonin to get your body back on schedule , the AASM recommends starting supplements before you leave on a trip and continuing for a few days after you arrive .\nSmall doses taken before you want to go to sleep should do the trick .\n( More on the correct dosages in a bit . )\nPeople whose days and nights are upside down because they work varying shifts may also benefit from melatonin supplements .\nA 2014 review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 milligrams of melatonin taken after a night shift increased sleep duration by about 24 minutes .\n( The actual dose didn \u2019 t seem to influence the results . )\nHowever , other studies have had mixed results or shown no benefit .\nIf you \u2019 re a shift worker and want to try melatonin , the AASM recommends taking the supplement after getting home in the morning .\nThat way , you won \u2019 t feel drowsy on your drive home .\nScientists have also looked at whether melatonin can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere \u2019 s some evidence to suggest that melatonin may benefit people with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder ( DSWPD ) who fall asleep very late and consequently wake up later in the day .\nIt may also have a role to play in helping folks with REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD ) , which is when patients act out their dreams while sleeping .\nAn estimated 1 % to 2 % of the population has the condition , which affects older people more than younger ones and men more than women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the studies looking at the impact of melatonin on sleep have been small and have only noted relatively modest gains for these conditions , said Dr. Abhinav Singh , medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center .\nIs melatonin safe ?\nYes , melatonin supplements are safe , at least in the short term : There haven \u2019 t been any long-term ( or large-scale ) studies to say whether it \u2019 s safe to take for more than a month or two .\nWhile safe , melatonin still can have side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even short-term use can cause side effects like daytime drowsiness , headaches , and dizziness , according to a 2019 study on adverse events linked to melatonin .\nMelatonin supplements may also interact with certain medications such as blood thinners , anti-seizure drugs , diabetes medications , and contraceptives .\n\u201c Let your physician know that you \u2019 re taking it , \u201d Dasgupta said .\nPeople who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldn \u2019 t take melatonin .\nNeither should people with dementia , autoimmune diseases , depression , seizure disorders , diabetes @ @ @

re going to try melatonin supplements , Dasgupta recommends starting with a low dose ( about 3 mg ) taken two hours before bedtime , although some people need higher or lower amounts .\nIn many studies , researchers use 2 to 5 mg of melatonin , although it can be as high as 10 mg or more , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amount that \u2019 s closest to a 0.3 mg dose of melatonin , according to the AASM .\nIn general , you can buy melatonin in 1 to 10 mg doses , although it \u2019 s not always easy to know how much you are actually taking .\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn \u2019 t regulate dietary supplements the same way as prescription medications , which means you may not know exactly what amount is in an over-the-counter product , Wright said .\nIn fact , in one study of 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most contained wildly variable amounts of melatonin .\nThe dosage varied from lot to lot and between brands , with some containing almost no melatonin and others having a dose much higher than listed .\n( One type of chewable tablet said it contained 1.5 mg but was in fact 9 mg. ) Many also contained serotonin , a mood-altering hormone that \u2019 s a potentially dangerous controlled substance .\nIf you are taking melatonin , look for products that have been independently tested by US Pharmacopeia ( USP ) , ConsumerLab.com , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure the product actually contains melatonin in the dosage listed on the label .\nOral melatonin can start making you drowsy in 30 to 45 minutes , Singh said .\nThat means you should refrain from driving and avoid doing other things that could be dangerous when you are sleepy .\nIt 's best to limit the amount of time you use melatonin , as it really isn \u2019 t indicated for long-term or chronic use .\n\u201c If you find yourself frequently reaching for a bottle of melatonin to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to speak with a sleep specialist or bring this up with your primary care doctor , \u201d Singh said .\nOther ways to get to sleep without using melatonin If you have trouble falling asleep , doctors generally recommend trying nondrug options first .\nFor instance , dimming your lights and shutting off all electronic screens about two hours before bed will cue your body to produce melatonin , Wright said .\nOther \u201c sleep hygiene \u201d practices should be in place to give melatonin a chance .\nThat means : \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercise during the day but not before bed \u2022 Keeping your bedroom dark , quiet , and at a comfortable ( cool ) temperature \u2022 Avoiding caffeine ( and fluids in general ) before bed \u2022 Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day \u2022 Banning screens at least 30 minutes before retiring \u201c Dietary supplements should be part of

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson began Monday with smiles , praise , congratulations , and an allegation that she is too soft on child predators .\nThe mostly friendly opening day was a chance for Jackson to address the Senate for the first time , and for senators to test run their lines of attack and defense that will dominate the rest of the week .\nDick Durbin , chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , introduced Jackson as a champion of the rule of law with a long record of excellence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of Jackson being the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court .\n\u201c The reality is the court \u2019 s members , in one respect , have never really reflected the nation they served , \u201d Durbin said .\n\u201c In its more than 230 years , the Supreme Court has had 115 justices \u2014 108 have been white men , just two justices have been men of color , only five women have served on the court and just one a woman of color.\n\u201d Jackson told senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend the Constitution and take an impartial , apolitical approach to the job .\n\u201c I decide cases from a neutral posture .\nI evaluate the facts and I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the cases before me without fear or favor , and consistent with my judicial oath , \u201d she said .\nHanging over the hearings are the bitter confirmation battles of the three Supreme Court nominees by President Donald Trump , in particular the nomination of and sexual assault accusations against Brett Kavanaugh .\nSeveral Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Democrats had treated their party \u2019 s nominees unfairly .\nBut Jackson \u2019 s confirmation started off \u2014 mostly \u2014 with a friendlier vibe .\nA number of Republicans praised Jackson for her skill and inspiring story of rising through the judicial ranks from defense attorney to district judge to circuit judge .\nThey also raised a range of potential concerns , from Jackson \u2019 s past comments to progressive advocacy groups backing her nomination .\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley made headlines Sunday by writing a Twitter thread accusing Jackson of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing child sex abuse images .\nThe thread sparked vigorous rebuttal and debunking by the likes of CNN , the Washington Post , and the conservative National Review , which called the thread \u201c meritless to the point of demagoguery.\n\u201d Hawley repeated his argument during opening remarks on Monday while also seeming highly aware of the backlash .\nHe said he made his comments on Twitter so as not to surprise Jackson , who took notes as Hawley read through a list of cases .\nThe senator called the nominee \u201c enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to explain her judicial philosophy .\nThat won \u2019 t come until later in the week , when senators have a chance to question Jackson directly .\nThe most aggressive speech by far came from Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn , who invoked trans children competing in sports , critical race theory , and The 1619 Project while accusing Jackson of being a judicial activist with a secret agenda to indoctrinate children and free violent criminals .\nBlackburn then ended her speech by congratulating Jackson for her inspiring story .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , \u201d Blackburn said .\nDemocrats jumped to argue against assumed future attacks that Jackson is soft on crime .\nBoth sides also expressed that they hoped this confirmation process is less contentious than the previous three .\nDemocratic Sen.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A bill with broad support in the Senate that would make the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a Senate-confirmed position is alarming public health experts already exhausted by the politicization of their field .\nSponsored by Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Richard Burr of North Carolina , the Prevent Pandemics bill \u2014 wide-ranging legislation meant to better prepare the country for the next pandemic by modernizing data collection , strengthening medical supply chains , and more \u2014 passed out of the Senate Health Committee this week in a bipartisan 20\u20132 vote .\nSen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC director change and moved the proposal into the broader legislation from a stand-alone bill he sponsored .\nAlthough the bill easily passed out of the Senate committee , it still needs passage in the House , which has yet to introduce a companion bill .\nPublic health officials are concerned the CDC change would politicize the process of naming a new director , forcing holdups in Congress over mask mandates , gun control , and lab leak disputes .\nHealth officials also fear that directors , who are now appointed by presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced instead by pharmaceutical industry donors or political allies .\n\u201c If we learned anything during COVID , [ it \u2019 s that ] we want a rigorous scientist with public health experience who stays out of the political arena in that position , \u201d said Lawrence Gostin , director of the O \u2019 Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University .\nPresident Joe Biden placed current CDC Director Rochelle Walensky in office as soon as he came took the White House because her position did not require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outlier compared to those running other pandemic agencies .\nOther key public health positions , including directors of the Food and Drug Administration , the National Institutes of Health , and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response , require Senate confirmation .\nUnder the bill , the current CDC director would be able to stay on without being subject to a Senate confirmation .\n\u201c The CDC Director regularly makes decisions that impact the health of Americans , so taxpayers in this country deserve a say in who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a statement .\n\u201c Just as we do with other high-level nominees , including nominees who serve in healthcare-related roles , the Senate should thoroughly vet and consider the qualifications of any nominee for CDC director.\n\u201d During the outset of the pandemic in the Trump administration , political appointees interfered with CDC guidelines on safe gatherings and scientific findings .\nThen\u2013CDC director Robert Redfield faced criticism for not halting such interference and not pushing back against White House advisers who supported letting the virus freely infect the US population to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee aide told BuzzFeed News the entire Prevent Pandemics Act would strengthen public health and preparedness policies .\n\u201c As part of these efforts , it also bolsters leadership and accountability at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by making the director Senate confirmed \u2014 the same as other key public health and preparedness positions.\n\u201d In January , then\u2013White House COVID czar Jeff Zients told reporters that the White House would \u201c leave it to Congress \u201d to decide if the CDC position should have Senate confirmation .\nWalensky , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his response .\nTwo former CDC directors , Tom Frieden and Jeffrey Koplan , however , told BuzzFeed News that Senate confirmation of their past position was a bad idea .\n\u201c Requiring Senate confirmation for the CDC Director is a quick , simple and this wrong solution for the complicated problem of improving the CDC , \u201d Frieden said by email .\n\u201c It is imperative that the President be able to appoint and fill the nation \u2019 s chief public health leader on Day 1 of an administration.\n\u201d Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just accelerate the politicization of the position that took place during the pandemic .\n\u201c This is a really bad idea , \u201d said Georges Benjamin , executive director of the American Public Health Association .\n\u201c It just creates an opportunity for people to grandstand for political purposes.\n\u201d In general , the person who heads the CDC should have public health or medical experience , Benjamin added .\n\u201c We should tap the enormous expertise we have out there , scientists and technical experts with the administrative skills to do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have to have on-the-job learning.\n\u201d For decades , the CDC has pursued its public health mission in Atlanta , apart from the political world of agencies with regulatory roles , Gostin said .\nRequiring Senate confirmation of the CDC chief would shift the agency away from public health and toward political action , he suggested .\n\u201c This is just going to make it into a hyperpartisan appointment , \u201d Gostin said .\nHe pointed to the brawls over Supreme Court nominations and the recent messy installment of FDA Director Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm a nominee could hinder the CDC in an emergency .\nConfirmation hearings , he added , could devolve into \u201c ideological purity tests.\n\u201d \u201c They could be asking , \u2018 Do you support masks ?\n\u2019 , \u2018 Do you support vaccine mandates ?\n\u2019 , or \u2018 Do you support firearms control ?\n\u2019 \u201d Gostin said .\n\u201c So there will be pressure on your appointee to say things that were politically correct but without any scientific or public health justification .\n\u201d",

would make her scream and cry in pain , drained by the compulsion to level out her skin .\n\u201c In my mind I \u2019 m screaming at myself to stop picking , stop picking , but I just couldn \u2019 t , \u201d Scott said .\n\u201c I had to have someone physically pull my arm away.\n\u201d The dry heat where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intense , but she couldn \u2019 t wear deodorant because picking made her skin raw , so she constantly worried about body odor , too .\n\u201c It felt really shameful , \u201d Scott said .\n\u201c I became disgusted with myself.\n\u201d Then she found videos on TikTok about people struggling with the same thing , which made her feel seen .\nThat was the first time she \u2019 d heard about skin picking disorder , a mental illness related to obsessive compulsive disorder that involves repeatedly picking at skin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical damage .\nAbout six months ago , a dermatologist finally diagnosed her with the condition and prescribed an ointment called triamcinolone acetonide .\nThe medication healed the scabs that formed in her armpits , which helped Scott avoid the urge to pick at her skin , a feeling many with the condition experience due to emotional and physical factors .\nReceiving a diagnosis helped her immensely ; now Scott is in recovery and has joined the many people with the illness who have posted about their journey on TikTok .\n\u201c Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a TikTok caption in August 2021 .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve kept this a secret for a long time and i feel it \u2019 s time to share my journey so others don \u2019 t feel alone !\n\u201d Skin picking disorder affects as many as 1 in 20 people and is a form of self-soothing to handle emotional distress .\nIt was informally called dermatillomania ( a term still commonly used ) or compulsive skin picking until 2013 , when it was classified as excoriation disorder by the American Psychiatric Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) .\nResearch on the disorder is in its \u201c infancy , \u201d but awareness around the illness has grown , especially in the past five years , according to Karen Pickett , a licensed psychotherapist in California who has researched the condition for 20 years .\nThe disorder goes far beyond popping pimples or removing dry skin .\nIt can cause conspicuous lesions on the body .\nPeople with the disorder often miss out on normal life or suffer emotional distress because of the compulsion .\nPickett said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to stop and seek the satisfaction of checking the skin for areas to work at .\nThe behavior sets off synapses that produce dopamine and endorphin hits in the brain .\n\u201c Skin pickers can talk about the \u2018 reward \u2019 as a feeling of accomplishment or relief or a way to self-soothe , \u201d Pickett said .\nAccording to Lauren McKeaney , CEO and founder of the Chicago-based Picking Me Foundation , triggers depend on the person but can be anything from a stressful day to a comment about your appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scanning , a process of unconsciously searching the skin for something to smooth out , or focused picking , honing in on a perceived imperfection for an extended period of time before \u201c coming to \u201d and realizing what damage has been done , McKeaney said .\nShe likened skin picking to an unavoidable \u201c signal \u201d from the body about an emotional state ; to find a solution to picking , it \u2019 s important to recognize the emotion behind the behavior , she said .\nBased on research about closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 % of people with skin picking disorders have other psychological conditions , such as depression , because of its emotional regulation component .\nLauren Brown , 26 , said she thinks her family \u2019 s history of addiction and depression , and her own \u201c addictive personality , \u201d set her up to potentially have dermatillomania .\nFor her , skin picking was a normal habit exacerbated to dangerous levels by a change in her environment .\nBrown , who wrote a memoir about anxiety and skin picking called Hands , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to a new city and felt lonely .\nAfter a while , she couldn \u2019 t resist looking at herself in the mirror for extended periods of time , picking at her skin , and savoring the reward of clearing perceived irregularities .\nIt \u2019 s hard to explain to someone who doesn \u2019 t have the disorder , she said , but she felt a sense of \u201c achievement.\n\u201d \u201c You think , It \u2019 s just a habit and I can stop whenever I want , \u201d Brown said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated by a sense of wanting to improve skin or a desire to release a feeling .\nFor her , she wanted to get away from negative feelings about her new life .\nAfter picking , the emotions would briefly go away , but then she \u2019 d be jolted back into reality .\n\u201c You go into this mindless state of almost enjoyment .\n\u2026 You all of a sudden wake up to realize time has passed \u2014 that can be a shocking moment , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Skin picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through uncomfortable thoughts and feelings , \u201d Pickett said , adding that skin picking is a common way for someone to deal with difficult emotions if they are already in recovery from another mental illness .\nOne emotional regulator replaces another .\nFor McKeaney , it was a way to pacify herself any time she felt too anxious or excited .\n\u201c It really developed into a repetitive ingrained behavior I used to regulate stimuli , \u201d she said .\nThe disorder affected many of her childhood experiences ; she quit figure skating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healing scabs on her legs made it difficult to pull her tights off .\nShe couldn \u2019 t stay the night at a friend \u2019 s house out of fear she \u2019 d have a picking episode ; her parents only allowed her to have black bedsheets because they masked the little blood marks she \u2019 d leave in her sleep .\nA lot of what is known about skin picking disorder is based on research on the closely related trichotillomania , or hair pulling disorder , which is also a body-focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may pull their hair or pick at their skin for similar emotional reasons , or even do both things , so scientists study the disorders closely .\nOne 2006 study concerning trichotillomania concluded that two mutations in the SLITRK1 gene were linked to hair-pulling disorder .\nGiven the similarities of hair pulling and skin picking disorders , Pickett said it \u2019 s possible to assume that a genetic marker may cause skin picking disorder , too , although she said no research has pinpointed one yet .\nPickett said she works with parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving \u201d it to their children .\nSimone Kolysh , 38 , a sociologist based in Maryland , has noticed their 15-year-old son is scratching on his shoulders and arms , the same areas they do .\nThey point it out to him and provide a fidget toy to replace the urge to pick , without trying to make a big deal about it .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a lot kinder to my kids than I am to myself , \u201d said Kolysh , who has four children and said seeing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them feel ashamed and blame themself for his behavior .\nHow the pandemic raised awareness of skin picking disorder The pandemic was a pressure cooker for many people with skin picking disorder , Pickett , the psychotherapist , said .\nSome people with dermatillomania who spoke with BuzzFeed News said the pandemic exacerbated their anxiety and depression , leading them to double down on their behaviors in search of some form of relief .\nLockdown meant there was also a reduced likelihood of other people seeing their skin .\nMcKeaney of the Picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin when she was 5 years old .\nHer body is covered in scars from sores she created as a child \u201c anywhere [ her ] hands could reach , \u201d she told BuzzFeed News .\nNow 35 and in recovery , McKeaney said the pandemic was triggering ; suddenly the CDC was saying \u201c Don \u2019 t touch your face , \u201d something her parents used to say to stop her picking .\nBut more time in front of the mirror also meant new opportunities for self-reflection , she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the pandemic of people seeking support from the organization .\nAs people were isolated and experienced uncertainty during the pandemic , interest in understanding these symptoms increased : Google Trends shows a growth in queries in the US for \u201c dermatillomania \u201d and \u201c skin picking \u201d after spring 2020 .\nNow an otherwise little-known community is speaking up : Advocacy organizations , bots , apps , TikTokers , and Instagram accounts are spreading awareness about the disorder , debunking myths , sharing personal experiences , and offering support and resources .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin on his palms since June 27 , 2020 .\nThe 18-year-old first-year student at Brooklyn College , who is autistic , started creating lesions on their hands around the age of 5 as a form of stimming , a term that refers to self-calming behaviors .\nHe couldn \u2019 t stop , sometimes targeting the area for 30 minutes at a time .\nEmbarrassed by the look of their palms , which became red and raw from the picking , Jeanfrancois avoided giving high fives or would position his hand so only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first summer of the pandemic , Jeanfrancois decided to make a change .\nHis mother had told him that when she was younger , she had picked her skin too , and her recovery motivated him to try to stop .\nBy focusing on other actions such as meditating , playing video games , or exercising , Jeanfrancois has been able to fill the gap .\nThey have since posted about his disorder on TikTok , sharing how he stopped picking and achieved significant recovery milestones .\nJennifer Hollander , a nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plastic & Laser Surgery , helps hundreds of patients nationally with cosmetic skin concerns and said people rarely know they have skin picking disorder when they come to her .\n\u201c I would say it \u2019 s underreported because there \u2019 s a lot of shame around it , \u201d Hollander said , adding she \u2019 s seen an \u201c uptick \u201d in patients with skin picking disorder and is treating them \u201c now more than ever.\n\u201d But she focuses on having a conversation with patients about how common the condition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell if a patient has skin picking disorder or another skin condition , such as acne , because picking creates \u201c secondary \u201d wounds on top of those caused by other conditions .\nBecause medical research into the disorder is lacking , she said , she \u2019 s glad to be able to connect patients with support groups or share her expertise on social media .\nTalking about the condition , both with their family and online , has helped a lot , said Kolysh .\n\u201c Once I started posting pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , I got a bit more of a handle on it , \u201d they said .\n\u201c I became more in control of the behavior because I brought it into my conscious sphere out of my subconscious.\n\u201d \u201c Talking about it and sharing photos of my skin and not blurring it out or editing it helped normalize it , \u201d they added .\nMany of the people who are publicly sharing their experiences with skin picking disorder are white women like herself , said Pickett , the psychotherapist .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more likely to seek out therapy in the US than other groups .\nAnother is that while Black and other nonwhite groups may experience more emotional trauma than white people , there \u2019 s a gap in receiving a diagnosis or getting therapy , according to Mental Health America .\n( In 2018 , over half of Black and African American adults with a serious mental illness did not receive treatment . )\nJeanfrancois , who is Black and bisexual , said he is inspired to spread awareness about skin picking disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is especially important , he said , because symptoms like bloody wounds show differently on nonwhite bodies .\nScott , who is Black , said the disorder resurfaced existing insecurities about her skin color .\nBefore she started picking at her armpits , she said , she was already self-conscious about the area because of dark spots caused by shaving , something Black women experience due to higher melanin levels .\n\u201c White women are overrepresented in the research , \u201d Pickett said .\n\u201c Hopefully that will change with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s like to have skin picking disorder Skin picking disorder is complex because it feels good in the moment , but shame and remorse often follow .\nScarlett , 20 , an online personal coach in Northamptonshire , England , is in recovery from depression and an eating disorder but has struggled with skin picking since she was 12 .\nSkin picking served as a way for her to avoid self-harm caused by depression or deal with emotions she had after eating .\nScarlett ( who did not want her last name mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid saying \u201c stop picking your skin \u201d or \u201c your skin is looking better \u201d to those with the disorder .\n\u201c [ If ] someone [ mentions ] anything to do with my skin \u2026 I end up just making it worse , \u201d she said , adding that comments like these fail to address the root of the behavior , and sometimes compel her to focus even more on her face .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just understanding that it 's difficult to not do it.\n\u201d Pickett added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin picking disorder largely because of lack of information .\nIt \u2019 s not their fault.\n\u201d \u201c That \u2019 s the inner conflict \u2014 I want to skin pick and I want to stop , \u201d Pickett said .\nWhen she treats people , she talks about the behavior , its \u201c addictive quality , \u201d the emotional regulation needed to calm her brain , how to stop , and finding other techniques for dealing with thoughts and feelings .\nPickett said it \u2019 s not clear to researchers how the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but self-reported data shows that it can be a form of the mind soothing itself .\nShe said that the disorder is a pendulum of reward and shame : \u201c You feel bad about yourself , and it precipitates all these emotions , which you then deal with via the behavior .\n\u2026 Breaking that cycle can be quite difficult.\n\u201d Kim Mills , a 29-year-old creator who posts on TikTok and Instagram as Kim on Skin , bit her nails as a child , and after puberty that evolved into skin picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d she said , and she got frustrated that she wasn \u2019 t growing out of it .\nShe \u2019 d give herself goals \u2014 once she got a boyfriend or her first apartment , she would stop picking \u2014 but the end never came .\nIt was isolating .\n\u201c I felt like people around me only knew a certain side of me , \u201d Mills said .\n\u201c I felt like friends and family didn \u2019 t really know me.\n\u201d Mills now hosts Dermatillo-Diaries : The BFRB Podcast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and promotes products like Nudge , a wristband device for skin pickers that vibrates and lights up whenever someone raises their hands to their face or head .\n( Mills said the Nudge device has been out of stock since the start of the pandemic , but the company declined BuzzFeed News \u2019 request for comment on when it plans to restock . )\nHow to manage skin picking and get help There \u2019 s no single way a doctor may approach treating someone for skin picking disorder .\nAwareness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution is different for every person .\nSome medical providers may prescribe an ointment like Scott received , while others may send a patient to a therapist for a mental health evaluation .\nMcKeaney of the Picking Me Foundation said she creates information packets to send to physicians \u2014 who are often the first point of contact with someone with dermatillomania \u2014 and a directory of informed medical providers .\nHollander , the nurse practitioner , gives patients the foundation \u2019 s \u201c fiddle packs , \u201d which include tools to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their body .\nShe said she can \u2019 t speak for the whole medical community but noted that her nursing background gives her a \u201c holistic \u201d approach to skin picking disorder that focuses on the emotional factors behind a skin problem ; she also refers patients with skin picking disorder to a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy , which provides people with ways to approach specific behaviors in the moment .\nMany skin pickers feel like they \u2019 re the only people doing it .\nBut the Picking Me Foundation has run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has grown from three attendees to about 40 per meeting .\nThe foundation now has over 800 members , and its email list has doubled in size since the start of the pandemic .\nMills said she had trouble finding useful forums or treatments on her own when she started her recovery three years ago , prompting her to make social media content as Kim on Skin to help others feel seen and learn more about skin picking disorder herself .\nShe started her recovery by tracking her triggers , writing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episodes were , and how these might be connected to other events that day .\nThere \u2019 s even an app she used for this purpose called SkinPick , which provides a self-monitoring tool and a four-week course to help people understand and reduce their skin picking .\nAfter gathering this data , Mills noticed that job stresses were often behind her picking , so she pivoted from a career in finance to one in social media .\nShe now has a full-time job but hopes to eventually focus full time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important it is to not downplay someone \u2019 s skin picking as only a habit .\n\u201c Then they \u2019 re back to square one , \u201d she said , \u201c feeling embarrassed and even more alone.\n\u201d Investing time in recovery is also not something that may come naturally to people with dermatillomania , Mills said .\n\u201c A large majority are struggling with providing self-care , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Because of that , a big investment into themselves , that 's really hard for people to justify.\n\u201d Self-managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers .\nFor McKeaney , avoiding mirrors is important .\nShe splashes water on the sink in her bathroom so she won \u2019 t bring her face close to the mirror .\nShe also leaves the lights off , keeps the door open , puts a tape boundary on the floor , uses acrylic nails ( which are less sharp on skin ) , and wears pimple patches to hide areas she would be tempted to pick .\nScarlett , the personal coach in England , manages her picking by going on walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom , and covering up mirrors with towels .\nShe spoke out on TikTok about skin picking and connects via DMs with others who do it , which makes her feel less alone .\nShe said her skin picking has become less intense with each little change .\nIn July 2020 , she decided to enter a bodybuilding competition ; knowing the event was coming up served as a reminder to hold back from skin picking .\nPickett \u2019 s advice for anyone who encounters a friend or relative with skin picking disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options , and other resources from the TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors , and then ask them if they \u2019 ve heard of the disorder and if they think it might be something they

themselves , \u201d McKeaney said .\n\u201c This disorder already tears us apart and does n't deserve another minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is part of our Body Week series .\nTo read more , click here .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A US Secret Service inspector testified Monday that former vice president Mike Pence was moved to an underground loading dock on the Senate side of the US Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection , a rare public admission of security protocol that prosecutors had fought to stop from coming out in these cases .\nWhether it \u2019 ll actually help the defendant who won that reveal remains to be seen .\nMonday marked the first day of trial for Couy Griffin , an elected county commissioner from Otero County , New Mexico , and the leader of Cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second person charged in connection with the Capitol attack to stand trial ; unlike the first defendant , Guy Reffitt , who was convicted by a federal jury earlier this month , Griffin \u2019 s case will be decided by the judge alone .\nGriffin faces two misdemeanor counts : illegally being in a restricted area within the Capitol or grounds and engaging in \u201c disorderly and disruptive conduct \u201d in a restricted area with the intent of disrupting government business .\nEach offense carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area \u201d as one where a Secret Service protectee \u2014 in this case , Pence \u2014 \u201c was and would be temporarily visiting.\n\u201d Griffin doesn \u2019 t dispute he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 .\nHis travel companion filmed their movements onto the grounds and up to a platform where Griffin addressed the crowd and spoke directly to the camera .\nThe defense \u2019 s strategy instead is to challenge whether the government can prove each element of the crimes he \u2019 s been charged with .\nOne of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pence was evacuated from the Senate chamber as the mob descended on the Capitol grounds and made its way toward the building , he was moved to a location that was no longer within the bounds of the \u201c restricted area \u201d at the Capitol .\nThey \u2019 re also arguing that for Griffin to be guilty , he had to know he was entering a restricted area \u2014 his lawyer questioned witnesses about whether there were fences or signs visible that would have made that clear to Griffin \u2014 and believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHis lawyer highlighted evidence that they contend shows Griffin thought Pence had already certified the results of the Electoral College by the time he arrived .\nUS District Judge Trevor McFadden \u2019 s decision to let Griffin \u2019 s lawyer probe Pence \u2019 s location was a setback for the government .\nIt had the ripple effect of forcing the government at the last minute to request , and ultimately receive , permission from the US Capitol Police Board to share with the defense a piece of evidence that they hadn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security concerns \u2014 surveillance footage of Pence 's whereabouts during the breach .\nBy the end of the day , McFadden said Griffin \u2019 s lawyer Nicholas Smith hadn \u2019 t shown that Pence left the restricted area during the hours that he was in the loading dock , suggesting the judge wasn \u2019 t sold on that defense tack .\nThe trial is expected to wrap up on Tuesday .\nIt wasn \u2019 t immediately clear when McFadden would announce his verdict .\nGriffin isn \u2019 t charged with assaulting police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other more serious offenses associated with the insurrection .\nBut his public persona as the horse-riding leader of Cowboys for Trump \u2014 he had a sit-down with then-president Donald Trump at the White House in September 2019 \u2014 his position as an elected county commissioner , and his later ties to the 2020 election conspiracy theory movement made his case one of the higher-profile prosecutions .\nIn arguing to keep Griffin in jail after his arrest , prosecutors highlighted statements he \u2019 d made after the attack that they alleged suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c We could have a 2nd Amendment rally on those same steps that we had that rally yesterday .\nYou know , and if we do , then it \u2019 s gon na be a sad day , because there \u2019 s gon na be blood running out of that building.\n\u201d They argued that as the head of the Cowboys for Trump he \u2019 d engaged in \u201c inflammatory , racist , and at least borderline threatening advocacy.\n\u201d A federal magistrate judge originally ordered Griffin to stay in custody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to go home in February 2021 .\nHe \u2019 s reportedly remained involved in efforts to question the legitimacy of ballots cast in the 2020 election .\nSeparate from his legal defense in court , he \u2019 s been affiliated with Trump ally and conservative lawyer Sidney Powell \u2019 s Defending the Republic group ; the organization produced a 50-minute video about Griffin and his case and released it on its website .\nPowell recently was part of a legal team that represented Griffin and Cowboys for Trump in an unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico for political organizations .\nGriffin gave up his right to a jury trial and chose to go before McFadden instead .\nHe appeared upbeat when he showed up to court on Monday morning , wearing what looked like a similar black cowboy hat that he \u2019 d worn on Jan. 6 and a white button-down shirt with \u201c C4T \u201d \u2014 standing for Cowboys for Trump \u2014 on the collar .\nHe \u2019 d driven to Washington and indicated he might try to ride his horse to the courthouse , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lawyers .\nHeading into Monday \u2019 s proceedings , McFadden had already been critical of how the government had handled parts of Griffin \u2019 s case along with other Jan. 6 prosecutions .\nProsecutors had originally included Kamala Harris , then the vice president\u2013elect , in charging papers as one of the Secret Service protectees who was at the Capitol during the attack , and McFadden penalized prosecutors for being slow to remove those references in Griffin \u2019 s case and at least one other prosecution once they confirmed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMcFadden agreed with the government that Griffin \u2019 s lawyer wouldn \u2019 t be allowed to ask questions about the details of Secret Service emergency protocols generally .\nBut the judge ruled that Pence \u2019 s location was fair game .",

Josh Hawley made headlines Sunday by writing a Twitter thread accusing Jackson of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing child sex abuse images .\nThe thread sparked vigorous rebuttal and debunking by the likes of CNN , the Washington Post , and the conservative National Review , which called the thread \u201c meritless to the point of demagoguery.\n\u201d Hawley repeated his argument during opening remarks on Monday while also seeming highly aware of the backlash .\nHe said he made his comments on Twitter so as not to surprise Jackson , who took notes as Hawley read through a list of cases .\nThe senator called the nominee \u201c enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to explain her judicial philosophy .\nThat won \u2019 t come until later in the week , when senators have a chance to question Jackson directly .\nThe most aggressive speech by far came from Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn , who invoked trans children competing in sports , critical race theory , and The 1619 Project while accusing Jackson of being a judicial activist with a secret agenda to indoctrinate children and free violent criminals .\nBlackburn then ended her speech by congratulating Jackson for her inspiring story .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , \u201d Blackburn said .\nDemocrats jumped to argue against assumed future attacks that Jackson is soft on crime .\nBoth sides also expressed that they hoped this confirmation process is less contentious than the previous three .\nDemocratic Sen.

hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 attack .\nAt the same time , he found that the bar had to be higher for the government to show that a person \u2019 s actions at the Capitol crossed the line into disorderly conduct , beyond the mere fact of their illegal presence .\nGriffin will be sentenced on June 17 .\nBoth charges were misdemeanor offenses carrying up to a year in prison .\nGriffin was the second person charged in connection with Jan. 6 to go to trial ; the first defendant , Guy Reffitt , was convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awaiting sentencing .\nGriffin had opted to give up his right to a jury and have McFadden decide his case alone .\nDuring the two-day bench trial , there was no dispute from the defense that Griffin went to the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack , or even that he \u2019 d climbed over walls to get up to a platform in front of the building .\nInstead , the defense \u2019 s strategy had been to argue that the government couldn \u2019 t prove that Griffin \u2019 s actions violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge him with .\nGriffin faced two misdemeanor counts : illegally being in a restricted area within the Capitol or grounds and engaging in \u201c disorderly and disruptive conduct \u201d in a restricted area to disrupt government business .\nBoth charges defined a \u201c restricted area \u201d as one where a Secret Service protectee \u2014 in this case , former vice president Mike Pence \u2014 \u201c was and would be temporarily visiting.\n\u201d In announcing his decision , McFadden explained that he credited testimony from US Capitol Police and US Secret Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol began and that when Griffin climbed over what \u2019 s known as the \u201c Olmsted wall \u201d on his way towards the building on the west side , he entered it .\nGriffin had filmed a video in front of the west side of the Capitol a day earlier , the judge noted , and it was likely that he \u2019 d seen the fencing around the area .\nGriffin climbed over three walls , including two where he used a metal bike rack and a wooden plank for assistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person \u201d that they weren \u2019 t supposed to be there , the judge said .\nAs Griffin made his way forward , he went up a stairway and through what had been a closed door , and the judge highlighted a video where Griffin or someone near him was heard talking about waiting for the door to be broken down .\nGriffin was aware of pepper spray in the air .\nFinally , the judge referenced two videos of Griffin speaking after Jan. 6 where he talked about the area being closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence on its own might not have been enough to convict Griffin , but that taken together , the government had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt .\nMcFadden rebuffed various defense challenges to some of the broader issues the defense raised about whether the offense Griffin had been charged with could apply to any person involved in the attack on the Capitol .\nHe found that the restricted area at least covered the first wall that Griffin had climbed over .\nHe found that Pence was \u201c temporarily visiting \u201d the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to an underground loading dock near the Capitol Visitor Center , he was still in the restricted area .\nHe found that the government didn \u2019 t have to show that Griffin knew Pence was still there .\nMcFadden \u2019 s findings on these questions of law aren \u2019 t binding on any of his other colleagues presiding over Jan. 6 cases , but the government can now point to his conclusions if other defendants try to raise similar arguments .\nOn the second charge , however , McFadden found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol failed to meet the standard for disorderly conduct .\nThe judge concluded that the government \u2019 s evidence didn \u2019 t show that Griffin intended to disrupt official business at the Capitol .\nMcFadden focused on the fact that Griffin had tried to lead the crowd in a prayer and called on people to kneel , saying it was a move arguably aimed at calming people down and not filing them up .\nGriffin had made statements about wanting to stop the election from being stolen , but the judge said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was trying to disrupt Congress .\nHeading into closing arguments , McFadden signaled he was grappling with two issues in the government \u2019 s case : whether prosecutors could prove that Griffin knew he was entering a restricted area , and whether Griffin \u2019 s actions that afternoon \u2014 which included leading the crowd in prayer and making loud comments in support of the mob , as well as his physical presence \u2014 met the bar for being disorderly conduct .\nAssistant US Attorney Janani Iyengar pointed out that Griffin had climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal bike rack and a wooden plank to make his way over , and then walked up a set of stairs within temporary scaffolding that had been built for the inauguration festivities to reach a platform in front of the building that overlooked the crowd below .\n\u201c Any reasonable person \u201d would know they didn \u2019 t have authority to climb over a wall and enter a government space , she said .\nIyengar also focused on two videos from after Jan. 6 where Griffin described his experience at the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one from a week later at a meeting of the Otero County commission .\nIyengar noted that in both accounts , Griffin described the area he entered as being closed off \u2014 at the Otero County meeting he \u2019 d referred to \u201c fencing \u201d \u2014 and police telling the crowd they couldn \u2019 t go forward because the area had been blocked off in anticipation of the inauguration .\nGriffin \u2019 s lawyer Nicholas Smith argued that a witness who \u2019 d traveled with Griffin and received immunity to testify , Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he didn \u2019 t remember the pair encountering law enforcement and thought Griffin \u2019 s description of the area being closed off might have come from information Griffin learned later .\nSmith said there was no evidence Griffin saw fences or signs , and argued that a US Secret Service agent who testified at trial wasn \u2019 t totally clear on the extent of the restricted area , so how could his client be expected to know that .\nAs for the disorderly conduct charge , Iyengar argued that Griffin \u2019 s decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout and engage with the crowd set him apart from a person who had just walked around on the grounds .\nShe pointed to Secret Service Inspector Lanelle Hawa \u2019 s testimony that the ongoing breach meant they had to keep Pence in a secure location for hours , and that even if Griffin believed Congress had already certified the results of the Electoral College \u2014 that wouldn \u2019 t happen until after the building was cleared that evening \u2014 it was still a work day , so his presence would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed back on the idea that they were prosecuting Griffin for praying or for the content of his speech .\nShe argued that his location and the way he was loudly engaging with the crowd was what he was being charged for .\nSmith countered that the government \u2019 s theory crossed the line into implicating First Amendment-protected speech , and that they \u2019 d failed to meet the legal standard for showing that what Griffin said was actually threatening .\nSmith lodged a multi-part attack on the charges .\nHe argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading dock near the Capitol Visitor Center \u2014 a fact the judge had ordered the government to reveal at trial over its objection \u2014 that took Pence outside of the legally defined restricted area .\nMcFadden had said at the end of the first day of trial and during closing arguments on Tuesday that he didn \u2019 t buy that theory .\nSmith also argued that Pence wasn \u2019 t \u201c temporarily visiting \u201d when he went to the Capitol on Jan. 6 \u2014 another element of the charges \u2014 because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president has as president of the Senate .\nHe argued that the government not only had to prove that Griffin knew he was entering a restricted area , but also that Griffin knew Pence was there .\nMcFadden said that theory felt \u201c preposterous \u201d in terms of its practical application , questioning if it would mean the Secret Service had to provide public notice of which protectees were actually inside a building for a space to qualify as a \u201c restricted area.\n\u201d After hearing closing arguments , the judge recessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision .\nHe asked Griffin \u2019 s lawyer if they wanted to go right into sentencing , but Smith said he wanted to wait and put their sentencing proposal in writing .\nSmith also asked if they could do sentencing by video \u2014 the court has allowed remote sentencing during the pandemic \u2014 but McFadden said no .",

        "content": "If you have to deal with difficult decisions and stressful situations on the daily , not to mention the dumpster fire that is the news cycle at any given moment , it \u2019 s not unusual to have anxiety and intrusive thoughts that keep you awake at night .\nThere are things you can do that help .\nFor example , you can try cognitive behavioral therapy , which aims to transform your negative habits and thoughts about sleep into positive ones .\nHowever , there \u2019 s another sleep-promoting technique you might consider : meditation .\nIt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ruminating mind , and there are plenty of free apps you can use to make it easier to do .\n\u201c Meditation can really help with navigating stress in terms of calming the body down , \u201d said Cassandra Carlopio , a licensed psychologist in Australia and a meditation teacher focusing on sleep .\n\u201c It can help with shifting focus away from anxiety about sleep , or what we affectionately call \u2018 bedtime thought , \u2019 which can be very stressful.\n\u201d Meditation helps you connect to the present moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , and it can help you manage emotions that may cause daytime fatigue and disturb your ability to sleep at night .\nStill , \u201c meditation is not a wonder drug that fixes all sleep issues , which are very nuanced and complicated , \u201d Carlopio told BuzzFeed News .\nWhy meditation may help you sleep A major cause of sleeplessness is arousal in the brain triggered by the release of cortisol , adrenaline , and other stress-related hormones , according to Deirdre Conroy , director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets this primal fight-or-flight response that causes our hearts to pound , minds to race , and muscles to tense .\nWith the help of deep , slow , and controlled breathing that accompanies most meditation techniques , as well as the calm environment and general stillness you create when meditating , you can lower your heart rate and blood pressure and activate your parasympathetic nervous system , which is associated with resting and digesting rather than fighting or fleeing , Conroy told BuzzFeed News .\n\u201c Often we 're just going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really focused on our heart rate until we get into bed at night and learn that our heart is racing and that we \u2019 re very tense , \u201d Conroy said .\n\u201c If we practice meditation more often , we 're training our brain to be able to calm itself , like a self-management strategy.\n\u201d In one 2019 study , 40 healthy university students with no meditation experience had a bigger drop in saliva cortisol levels after 30 hours of meditation training over a four-day period compared to a control group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54 adults with chronic insomnia who had meditation training over eight weeks that focused on either coping with stress or insomnia .\nThe practice helped reduce the amount of time participants spent awake at night by an average of about 44 minutes post-treatment and about 50 minutes six months later .\nMeditation helped lower presleep arousal and insomnia severity too , according to the 2014 study published in the journal Sleep .\nSome research also suggests meditation can even physically change your brain in ways that could improve sleep quality by giving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn a 2012 study published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience , researchers compared brain images of 50 adults who had meditated routinely for years or even decades with 50 adults who didn \u2019 t meditate regularly .\nThey found that those who practiced long-term meditation had more gyrification , or folds in the cerebral cortex , the brain \u2019 s outer layer .\nThe more area in these grooves , the more brain surface and neurons that process information , although the study couldn \u2019 t determine if meditation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate study published in 2012 found meditation may affect how your amygdala \u2014 the part of the brain that processes emotions \u2014 is activated not only during the practice , but also after it \u2019 s done .\nPeople with certain medical conditions that make it harder to sleep well have also benefited from meditation , including those with diabetes , fibromyalgia , and breast cancer .\nAside from aiding sleep , meditation has also been associated with reducing pain caused by some illnesses , the craving to smoke cigarettes , and stress-induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diseases and conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome , ulcerative colitis , and high blood pressure .\nHow to use meditation for sleep There are two main ways you can use meditation to improve your sleep , according to Carlopio , the meditation expert .\nFirst , you can practice it throughout the day to help manage your stress and anxiety so you \u2019 re more relaxed by the time you go to bed .\nCarlopio said you can do this anytime , like during your lunch break at work .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to sleep , either on the floor next to your bed or even lying in it .\nIf you \u2019 re up for it , you can guide your own practice or get help from an app or video .\nMost techniques and traditions start with focusing on the breath \u201c because it happens in real time , \u201d Carlopio said .\nDoing so keeps your attention away from random thoughts and on the pure sensation of inhaling and exhaling .\nMany people believe meditation requires you to \u201c think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually the case .\nInstead , as thoughts arrive and your attention wanders , you try to observe them without judgment or emotion and gently return your mind to your breath or whatever else you choose to focus on , like sounds or other sensations .\nAnother type of self-guided meditation is a body scan .\nYou can start at the crown of your head or tip of your toes and slowly relax each body part as your focus moves up or down , \u201c like a flashlight from body part to body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should pay attention to any temperatures , tingles , or other sensations .\n( I like to imagine dozens of flowers sprouting and filling each limb as I shift my attention . )\nSome people also enjoy guided imagery , Carlopio said , though she admits it \u2019 s not for everyone .\nGuided imagery involves picturing yourself in a comforting place ; maybe it \u2019 s a dense forest clouded in misty fog or a sunny beach with waves crashing at the shore .\nIt should involve all five senses , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this tangible world that we 're in to a little bit more of a dreamlike land , and you 're not focused on the things that you 're worried about , \u201d she said .\nBut while some people are more \u201c imagery-orientated , \u201d others may find the technique distracting .\nListening to guided meditations is another way to doze off , said Carlopio , who added it \u2019 s helpful as a sleep aid because you can follow instructions while focusing your attention on the present moment .\n\u201c But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d she warned .\n\u201c Some are designed to make you more focused , which is great during the day but not so great if you want to fall asleep at night.\n\u201d Carlopio suggests finding guided meditations that are sleep-specific .\nApps you can download on your phone are a good start .\nThere are plenty of options to choose from , such as Aura , Insight Timer , Headspace , and Calm , many of which offer a range of meditations with teachers who have diverse accents , techniques , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided meditations on YouTube or directly seek out an expert \u2019 s help either solo or in group sessions .\nIf you plan on using your phone to play the meditations , Carlopio recommends having it set up before you settle down so you don \u2019 t have to scroll through your phone \u2019 s bright screen in the dark .\n( Blue light from digital screens can actually make it harder to fall asleep . )\nYou may also want to put your phone on silent , set the volume low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe also recommends setting realistic goals when starting out .\nFor most people , that means meditating for about five minutes a day , but it may take longer depending on the type of technique you \u2019 re using and the reason you \u2019 re using it .\nWhat to expect as a meditation beginner If you take away anything from this article , let it be this : Meditation takes practice , and you may not \u201c get it right \u201d the first time because there \u2019 s no specific way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply personal .\n\u201c There are as many ways to meditate as there are people , \u201d Carlopio said .\nShe likens trying meditation for the first time to trying a new sport .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t just pick up a bat and expect to hit the ball perfectly , \u201d Carlopio said .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve had your mind functioning a specific way for your entire life , and then all of a sudden you want to learn this new skill .\nIt could be quite a rude awakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one study found that advanced-level meditators spent more time in REM sleep \u2014 which is important for learning and memory \u2014 woke up less during the night , and spent less time in lighter sleep stages compared to beginner and nonmeditators , suggesting it may take some practice before you can reap the benefits of meditation for sleep .\nYou may even feel a bit uncomfortable during your first tries because you start to notice tension and certain thoughts that are hard to process .\n\u201c That \u2019 s totally normal , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to approach meditation with a sense of curiosity , kindness , and understanding , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about consistency and not expecting yourself to be really \u2018 good at meditation.\n\u2019 \u201d Even Buddhist monks who \u2019 ve been trained in meditation since they were children , and who don \u2019 t deal with common stressors like traffic , for example , can \u2019 t maintain perfect clarity for more than a minute or two , Carlopio said .\n\u201c For us to expect that we \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equanimity with a quiet mind for any period of time is completely unrealistic.\n\u201d How well you \u2019 re able to benefit from meditation for sleep also depends on what \u2019 s behind your sleep issues .\nIf you had a stressful day at work , you may be more likely to see an immediate improvement in mood and anxiety levels after meditating , Carlopio said .\nHowever , if you \u2019 re dealing with joblessness or other long-term issues , it may take longer for the practice to have an impact .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience to manage ongoing , very real stresses , \u201d Carlopio said .\nSitting still while calming your mind doesn \u2019 t suit everyone , and it can feel particularly difficult in a society that values productivity over quiet contemplation .\nFor some people with sleeping difficulties , exercising or talking with a therapist may be a better alternative .\nMeditation also may not help you sleep if you have a health condition like obstructive sleep apnea , a disorder that causes repetitive blockages in airflow during sleep , or a noise problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home .\nConroy of the University of Michigan said it \u2019 s important to assess whether your sleep problems are interfering with your ability to get through your day .\nIf so , you may need a different approach than meditation .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not always an obvious , easy fix .\nThere 's so much more than what meets the eye with sleep difficulties , \u201d Carlopio said .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t get disheartened about it and just keep seeking support until you get the issue addressed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to sleep well

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Big Cat Rescue in 2011 .\nAmanda started showing signs of illness when she was on \u201c vacation.\n\u201d Every month at Big Cat Rescue , one of the larger animals is given exclusive access to a massive 2.5-acre lakefront vacation enclosure .\nFor comparison , Florida law requires a minimum cage size of just 240 square feet for up to two tigers .\nThe smallest enclosure at Big Cat Rescue is 1,200 square feet , and that \u2019 s for a Savannah cat of just 20 pounds .\nBefore Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up onto wooden observation decks in the vacation enclosure , eschewing the ramps available for older animals .\nHer appetite was strong too .\nShe was enjoying treats like \u201c blood popsicles , \u201d which are made from runoff of the hundreds of pounds of meat required to feed the animals at Big Cat Rescue each day .\nJust a few days later , Amanda was dying .\nThe Big Cat Rescue caretakers gathered inside the enclosure , standing over her as she lay tranquilized on a blanket .\nHer blood work had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after page , line after line , it showed her organs were failing .\nThey had no choice ; Amanda was euthanized on Sept. 16 , 2021 .\nAmanda did not die from COVID , Baskin said , but the virus may have exacerbated conditions with which she was already grappling .\nFurther , Baskin said she wasn \u2019 t convinced that Amanda even had the virus .\nBelieving the home test they used might be a false positive ( the false positive rate of these tests is often less than 1 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample from Amanda to send to a laboratory .\nWhile awaiting results , Baskin \u2019 s team noticed that another tiger , Aria , who lives in the enclosure adjacent to Amanda \u2019 s , also just wasn \u2019 t herself .\nThis time around , they didn \u2019 t skip a beat .\nThey collected a sample from Aria , sent it off to the lab , and monitored her symptoms closely .\nWhen Amanda \u2019 s test result came back , it confirmed that she had COVID at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aria \u2019 s result came back ; hers was also positive , but she recovered .\nThe good news is that there is an option to help stop the spread of viruses from humans to animals ( and back again ) : routine vaccinations for both .\nThere are several veterinary vaccines for COVID-19 in different phases of development , including from Applied DNA Sciences and Evvivax .\nOne from Russian company Carnivac-Cov has been in circulation since May 2021 .\nBut the company that has made the most traction and been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills itself as \u201c the largest global animal health company.\n\u201d Zoetis started working on the formulation as early as March 2020 , just after news broke that a Pomeranian in Hong Kong tested positive for COVID .\n\u201c That was our initial reason , because ultimately , cats and dogs are our bread and butter , \u201d said Christina Lood , the company \u2019 s communications director .\nAt the time , the Hong Kong government was also requiring quarantines for pets of COVID-positive owners .\nBut that was early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , we have learned that even though pets can get COVID , the risk of them spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus to people is low , according to the CDC .\n\u201c They \u2019 re really not playing an active role in spreading the disease to humans , \u201d Lood said .\n\u201c The best way to protect your pets from COVID is to get yourself vaccinated.\n\u201d While no veterinary COVID vaccine has been fully approved for use in animals , the Zoetis shot is already being administered all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the San Diego Zoo .\nAfter the January 2021 outbreak , the zoo \u2019 s animal care team asked Zoetis for help .\nThe company had a few spare vials left over from testing and sent them to the zoo in March after receiving special authorization from the USDA .\nBecause the gorillas received COVID vaccines before almost all American humans , there was a burst of international news coverage .\nThen came widespread interest from over 70 zoos and sanctuaries throughout the US .\nZoetis responded with an initial donation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe company has since expanded that program to offer over 26,000 shots to facilities worldwide , including one in Chile and six in Canada .\nNot Baskin \u2019 s , though .\nShe and the veterinary team at Big Cat Rescue ran a risk analysis and decided not to vaccinate their animals yet .\nA big part of this decision : Big Cat Rescue is currently closed to outside visitors .\nThe only people who enter the property are Baskin , her family , and her team of 70 volunteer workers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated , and they all wear masks when they \u2019 re near the cats or preparing their food .\nThe Big Cat Rescue team members are also concerned about their older animals \u2019 ability to endure the turmoil of vaccination .\nAbout half of their tigers , lions , leopards , and ligers ( a genetic hybrid of a lion and a tiger ) are over the age of 12 ; seven are over 20 .\nBaskin described the process of giving injections as traumatic for the animals .\n\u201c We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every three years , and that \u2019 s a rodeo none of us look forward to , \u201d she said .\nHandlers have to guide the animals through tunnels into small lockout boxes ; they lower a special device called a \u201c catacomb , \u201d which presses the animal to the side of the cage .\n\u201c The whole time , they \u2019 re flailing around trying to get out of there , \u201d Baskin said , adding that she worries they could even have a heart attack .\nThe North Carolina Zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats .\nLocated 70 miles west of Raleigh , the world \u2019 s largest natural habitat zoo was one of the facilities approved by the USDA to administer the Zoetis shots .\nBetween Oct. 18 and 20 , caretakers vaccinated 33 animals , including 16 chimpanzees , seven western lowland gorillas , four hamadryas baboons , two African lions , two North American mountain lions , and a sand cat .\nThey used positive reinforcement to vaccinate , gradually training the animals to present their hind end in exchange for edible bribes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina Zoo was Olympia , a 23-year-old gorilla who keeper Stephanie Tien says is very cautious .\n\u201c She \u2019 s very suspicious of everything .\nWe kind of joke around that she \u2019 s the conspiracy theorist of the gorilla troop , \u201d Tien said .\nTien and her colleagues thought if Olympia sensed something was going on that she might not cooperate for the injection .\nSo , they started with her .\nAfterward , Tien showered Olympia with gifts : peppermint , jelly , fruits , and a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection lasts is not yet known .\nAll the animals received a second shot about three weeks after their first , but whether they will require subsequent boosters is still to be determined .\nJb Minter , the zoo \u2019 s director of animal health , has been collecting blood samples to test the animals \u2019 immunity levels .\n\u201c I have chimps and a lion and a mountain lion that will voluntarily give blood , \u201d he said .\nMinter planned to test them all at once as a cost-saving measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacted him with an offer to test them at a discount .\nData will be aggregated from all of the zoos that choose to participate , which could play a role in understanding the vaccine \u2019 s efficacy in different species .\n\u201c It was great on our part when the USDA reached out to us , \u201d he said .\n\u201c The more information we can gather and dispense out to zoos and institutions that are holding these exotic animals , the better the situation for their health.\n\u201d The North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero positive cases , is being proactive .\n\u201c We have been very lucky , \u201d Minter said , knocking a couple of times on his wooden desk .\nMinter works from both the zoo \u2019 s on-site hospital and the exhibits of more than 200 species .\nHis daily uniform consists of a blue polo shirt embroidered with the zoo \u2019 s logo and a wooden bead choker around his neck .\nMany zoo regulars recognize Minter on sight .\nAt the chimpanzee exhibit , a young boy ran up to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him too .\nMinter called for Jon , an older chimp who was peering at him from atop a towering tree trunk .\nJon heard him and ambled down to say hello through the glass .\nAs for Big Cat Rescue , no other animals other than Aria and Amanda have had positive tests .\nBaskin said she and her lead veterinarian may decide to vaccinate each of the cats when it comes time for their three-year shots .\n\u201c I think that would be his option , \u201d she said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we also haven \u2019 t had anybody due for their vaccines yet.\n\u201d That afternoon , a pair of smiling volunteers were making the rounds with medicines , catnip , and blood popsicles , of course .\nAnother group had just finished constructing ornate pi\u00f1atas for the cats to destroy on an internet livestream later that week .\nBaskin was supervising from her golf cart .\nContinuing her tour , she stopped in front of Aria \u2019 s enclosure .\n\u201c Aria , baby !\n\u201d Baskin said before moving on .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nShe slowed the cart a bit to talk about how they had removed part of the fence to give Aria more space .\nBut there was no reason for her to stop .",

Lindsey Graham used part of his time to angrily rehash Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation proceedings , during which a woman who \u2019 d known the now-justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blasey Ford , came forward with an allegation that he attempted to sexually assault her decades ago at a high school party ; Kavanaugh denied the claim .\nGraham initially tried to get Jackson to say how she \u2019 d feel about a hypothetical scenario where someone came forward with an accusation against her at the end of her hearings that she couldn \u2019 t address ; she said she didn \u2019 t understand the question .\nGraham then directly asked if she \u2019 d watched Kavanaugh \u2019 s hearings .\nShe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarify that she was generally familiar with what happened .\nWhen she attempted to shift the focus back to her own nomination , saying she \u2019 d appreciated the kindness that members , including Graham , had shown her during one-on-one meetings , he pulled the discussion back to Kavanaugh .\nFinally , Jackson explained that she didn \u2019 t \u201c have any comment on what procedures took place in this body regarding Justice Kavanaugh.\n\u201d Graham also focused his time Wednesday on what \u2019 s become a leading Republican line of attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people convicted of child sex abuse images offenses and her work on policy issues related to those types of cases as a member of the US Sentencing Commission .\nJackson delved into some of the nuances of these decisions , including that Congress had empowered judges to use a variety of tools besides prison time to achieve the goals of punishment \u2014 such as long-term computer monitoring \u2014 and that the sentencing guidelines were based on a pre-internet era that didn \u2019 t reflect how these offenses were now committed .\nThroughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were \u201c horrible \u201d crimes , but explained that judges were trying to apply a \u201c rational \u201d system for sentencing and to find ways of identifying different categories of offenders and sentencing them appropriately .\nGraham suggested that she did not consider the distribution of child sex abuse materials to be a \u201c bad thing \u201d before outright accusing her of such .\nFederal sentencing experts have described Jackson \u2019 s sentencing practices in cases of child sex abuse materials as \u201c mainstream , \u201d pointing out that the majority of federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases that don \u2019 t involve people charged with actually producing content .\n( Judges aren \u2019 t required to follow these guidelines , but they \u2019 re meant to ensure some consistency across the criminal justice system . )\nNear the end of Graham \u2019 s questioning , which saw him repeatedly interrupt Jackson , Sen. Dick Durbin , the Democratic chair of the committee , jumped in to point out that Congress had \u201c failed \u201d to update federal criminal laws related to offenses of child sex abuse materials in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c This is our fault ?\n\u201d Durbin replied : \u201c Partially it is , senator .\nTo be honest with you , it is.\n\u201d She talked again about the balancing test that Congress had laid out when questioned by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley about sentences in cases regarding child sex abuse images .\nHawley tweeted a thread last weekend highlighting these cases , putting him at the forefront of this line of attack against Jackson .\nThe nominee noted that Hawley \u2019 s accusations that her sentences were too low failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required to consider , including arguments from defense lawyers .\nShe called out Hawley for repeatedly asking her questions that he and other Republican members had already posed and that she \u2019 d already answered .\nHawley suggested that the fact that the internet had made this type of crime so much easier to commit was a reason to impose tougher sentences .\nJackson replied , \u201c Senator , the Congress has every ability to do that.\n\u201d North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis questioned Jackson \u2019 s handling of criminal cases more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off too easy : \u201c It seems as though you are a very kind person and that there is at least a level of empathy that enters into your treatment of a defendant that some could view as maybe beyond what some of us would be comfortable with , with respect to administering justice.\n\u201d Jackson replied that her approach to sentencing was \u201c within the framework that Congress has provided.\n\u201d She said that , by law , Congress directed judges to balance a range of factors in crafting a sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics , and that Congress had required judges to impose sentences that were \u201c sufficient but not greater than necessary to promote the purposes of punishment.\n\u201d She pointed out that she had , in fact , ordered lengthy prison terms in some cases , and that in criminal cases she wanted defendants to feel that they were heard and to spend time talking through the consequences of their crimes in the hopes of preventing them from doing it again in the future .\nTennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn asked the nominee how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow some people convicted of serious crimes , including violent offenses , to be released from prison , referring to cases where Jackson had granted compassionate release petitions during the pandemic .\nJackson noted that Congress had made a policy decision to allow people to seek early release in these types of situations .\nIowa Sen. Chuck Grassley asked if Jackson believed nationwide injunctions by judges were constitutional , referring to a common conservative criticism when federal judges blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a number of policies .\nJackson replied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t quite right \u2014 that when judges invalidated federal agency rules under the Administrative Procedure Act , and those decisions had a nationwide effect , they were carrying out a remedy that Congress had adopted as part of that law .\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy pressed Jackson to share her views on whether there should be more justices on the Supreme Court , often referred to as \u201c court-packing.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a proposal that \u2019 s gained traction among liberal advocacy groups and some Democratic members of Congress as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6\u20133 conservative majority .\nJackson offered a brief summary of the case for and against adding justices but declined to share her opinion about court-packing , saying she didn \u2019 t think it would be appropriate to weigh in on a matter that was ultimately up to Congress .\nKennedy pressed her on that answer , asking with skepticism if it wouldn \u2019 t make a difference to Jackson if she was one of nine or one of 28 justices .\n\u201c I would be thrilled to be one of however many Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , \u201d Jackson replied .\nKennedy pushed again : \u201c So you \u2019 d be okay if it was 28 ?\n\u201d Jackson \u2019 s confirmation hearing will resume Thursday for a fourth and final day , but she \u2019 s done answering questions ; the senators will hear last from a string of witnesses speaking for and against her nomination .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The second day of Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2019 s Supreme Court confirmation hearings focused as much on broad political grievances and the culture wars as it did on Jackson as an individual .\nTopics ranging from Sept. 11 to racist babies were invoked by Republicans as they attempted to tie Jackson to left-wing activist movements , while Democrats lauded her as a fair-minded and impartial judge .\nSen. Ted Cruz asked Jackson about the New York Times \u2019 1619 Project before launching into an extended session about critical race theory and which books are taught to children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read several passages from children \u2019 s books and asked Jackson if she believes babies are racist .\n( She said no . )\nThe basis for Cruz \u2019 s questions was Jackson serving on the board of trustees for the Georgetown Day School in Washington , DC .\nJackson said her role did not control the curriculum and seemed perplexed by the entire line of questioning .\n\u201c I have not reviewed any of those books , \u201d said Jackson .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t come up in my work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectfully , here to address.\n\u201d A main line of Republican inquiry involved Jackson \u2019 s sentences of people convicted of possessing child sex abuse images .\nAt one point , Cruz read aloud from a printed sign containing a Jackson quote in bold font discussing \u201c less-serious '' offenders .\nJackson responded that , as the sign itself showed , the quote was a question to a witness , not a statement of her beliefs .\nJackson spent much of Tuesday pushing back against charges of being soft in sentencing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c These crimes are horrible .\nI take them very seriously , \u201d she said .\nRepublicans and Democrats alike questioned Jackson about her judicial philosophy .\nA key exchange happened early in the hearing when Jackson was asked about her ideology and responded , \u201c I have a methodology.\n\u201d Jackson vowed to serve as an impartial and \u201c even-handed justice \u201d if confirmed , and said her judicial philosophy is defined by being an impartial judge who adheres to the limits of the court \u2019 s jurisdiction .\n\u201c I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbia , with some of the most politically contentious issues .\nMy record demonstrates my impartiality , \u201d she said .\nJackson said her background as a public defender \u2014 a rarity among Supreme Court nominees \u2014 gave her a helpful perspective as a judge that did not affect her rulings but did make her determined to ensure defendants understood what was happening in her trials .\nRepublicans questioned Jackson on her work defending Guantanamo Bay detainees and writing briefs for third parties advocating that indefinite detention of detainees is unlawful .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to pick their clients , \u201d said Jackson .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a service .\nThat \u2019 s what you do as a federal public defender .\nYou are standing up for the constitutional value of representation.\n\u201d Jackson \u2019 s hearing served as a proxy platform for long-running political feuds .\nSen.

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Big Cat Rescue in 2011 .\nAmanda started showing signs of illness when she was on \u201c vacation.\n\u201d Every month at Big Cat Rescue , one of the larger animals is given exclusive access to a massive 2.5-acre lakefront vacation enclosure .\nFor comparison , Florida law requires a minimum cage size of just 240 square feet for up to two tigers .\nThe smallest enclosure at Big Cat Rescue is 1,200 square feet , and that \u2019 s for a Savannah cat of just 20 pounds .\nBefore Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up onto wooden observation decks in the vacation enclosure , eschewing the ramps available for older animals .\nHer appetite was strong too .\nShe was enjoying treats like \u201c blood popsicles , \u201d which are made from runoff of the hundreds of pounds of meat required to feed the animals at Big Cat Rescue each day .\nJust a few days later , Amanda was dying .\nThe Big Cat Rescue caretakers gathered inside the enclosure , standing over her as she lay tranquilized on a blanket .\nHer blood work had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after page , line after line , it showed her organs were failing .\nThey had no choice ; Amanda was euthanized on Sept. 16 , 2021 .\nAmanda did not die from COVID , Baskin said , but the virus may have exacerbated conditions with which she was already grappling .\nFurther , Baskin said she wasn \u2019 t convinced that Amanda even had the virus .\nBelieving the home test they used might be a false positive ( the false positive rate of these tests is often less than 1 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample from Amanda to send to a laboratory .\nWhile awaiting results , Baskin \u2019 s team noticed that another tiger , Aria , who lives in the enclosure adjacent to Amanda \u2019 s , also just wasn \u2019 t herself .\nThis time around , they didn \u2019 t skip a beat .\nThey collected a sample from Aria , sent it off to the lab , and monitored her symptoms closely .\nWhen Amanda \u2019 s test result came back , it confirmed that she had COVID at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aria \u2019 s result came back ; hers was also positive , but she recovered .\nThe good news is that there is an option to help stop the spread of viruses from humans to animals ( and back again ) : routine vaccinations for both .\nThere are several veterinary vaccines for COVID-19 in different phases of development , including from Applied DNA Sciences and Evvivax .\nOne from Russian company Carnivac-Cov has been in circulation since May 2021 .\nBut the company that has made the most traction and been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills itself as \u201c the largest global animal health company.\n\u201d Zoetis started working on the formulation as early as March 2020 , just after news broke that a Pomeranian in Hong Kong tested positive for COVID .\n\u201c That was our initial reason , because ultimately , cats and dogs are our bread and butter , \u201d said Christina Lood , the company \u2019 s communications director .\nAt the time , the Hong Kong government was also requiring quarantines for pets of COVID-positive owners .\nBut that was early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , we have learned that even though pets can get COVID , the risk of them spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus to people is low , according to the CDC .\n\u201c They \u2019 re really not playing an active role in spreading the disease to humans , \u201d Lood said .\n\u201c The best way to protect your pets from COVID is to get yourself vaccinated.\n\u201d While no veterinary COVID vaccine has been fully approved for use in animals , the Zoetis shot is already being administered all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the San Diego Zoo .\nAfter the January 2021 outbreak , the zoo \u2019 s animal care team asked Zoetis for help .\nThe company had a few spare vials left over from testing and sent them to the zoo in March after receiving special authorization from the USDA .\nBecause the gorillas received COVID vaccines before almost all American humans , there was a burst of international news coverage .\nThen came widespread interest from over 70 zoos and sanctuaries throughout the US .\nZoetis responded with an initial donation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe company has since expanded that program to offer over 26,000 shots to facilities worldwide , including one in Chile and six in Canada .\nNot Baskin \u2019 s , though .\nShe and the veterinary team at Big Cat Rescue ran a risk analysis and decided not to vaccinate their animals yet .\nA big part of this decision : Big Cat Rescue is currently closed to outside visitors .\nThe only people who enter the property are Baskin , her family , and her team of 70 volunteer workers .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated , and they all wear masks when they \u2019 re near the cats or preparing their food .\nThe Big Cat Rescue team members are also concerned about their older animals \u2019 ability to endure the turmoil of vaccination .\nAbout half of their tigers , lions , leopards , and ligers ( a genetic hybrid of a lion and a tiger ) are over the age of 12 ; seven are over 20 .\nBaskin described the process of giving injections as traumatic for the animals .\n\u201c We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every three years , and that \u2019 s a rodeo none of us look forward to , \u201d she said .\nHandlers have to guide the animals through tunnels into small lockout boxes ;

        "content": "A nonsurgical N95 respirator is a mask designed to fit snugly around your nose and mouth with straps that go around your head ; it \u2019 s made of layered polypropylene , or plastic , fibers that effectively filter out 95 % of any bacteria or virus particles you or others breathe , cough , or sneeze out \u2014 if worn properly and consistently .\nThe material uses the power of static electricity to catch incoming germs or particles as air passes through the tiny spaces between the fibers .\nN95s are called \u201c respirators \u201d because they filter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like surgical masks , aren \u2019 t \u201c respirators \u201d because they can \u2019 t effectively filter the air you breathe ; they mostly help block large respiratory droplets that may carry germs from entering your mouth , like a snotty sneeze or phlegmy cough .\nThere are several different types and shapes of N95s ; some look like duck bills , others like domes , and several have three panels .\nThe main difference between nonsurgical and surgical N95s is that the latter are also fluid resistant to protect doctors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprays , Dr. David Banach , an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at UConn Health of the University of Connecticut , told BuzzFeed News .\nThe government is sending nonsurgical N95 respirators to the public because those are the masks that are available in the Strategic National Stockpile , the HHS spokesperson told us .\nBut there are similarly effective respirators , such as KN95s commonly sold at stores like Home Depot , that you could use as well .\nN95 respirators are regulated by the US with standards set by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIOSH ) , while KN95s ( and KF94s and others ) follow international standards , meaning they also should screen out about 95 % of germs and particles , but their effectiveness can vary between brands sold in the US .\nThat \u2019 s why Banach advises extra caution if you choose to wear these masks .\nThe CDC found that about 60 % of KN95s tested in 2020 and 2021 were less effective than advertised .\nThat said , many of the KN95s had a filter efficiency of 90 % or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtration efficiencies as low as 10 % to 20 % .\nBoth KN95s and KF94s offer the virus-catching electrostatic charge , so they should offer strong protection for you and others around you .\nLegitimate N95s are approved by the CDC \u2019 s NIOSH and will have specific markings , including the NIOSH logo or block letters on them to indicate their authenticity .\nKeep in mind that KN95s are not approved by NIOSH , so any claims to that effect suggests they are counterfeits .\nOther signs of counterfeit N95 respirators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes around your head , no markings on the filtering facepiece , and a missing or misspelled NIOSH mark .\nHere are some pictures of counterfeit respirators from the CDC and a full list of companies that make NIOSH-approved face respirators that are similarly or more protective than N95s .\nThe biggest complaint people make about N95s is that they can be hard to wear , particularly in hot conditions or when you have to exert yourself .\n( N95s with exhalation valves can help improve breathability , but experts strongly recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t filter the air you exhale \u2014 so they protect you , but not the people around you if you have COVID . )\nAlthough it may take a bit more effort to breathe through N95s , NIOSH tests have shown some of the respirators have better overall breathability than cloth or surgical masks , Karan of Stanford said , so it could take some time before you find the right type for you .\nOn the more comfortable side are the loose-fitting and disposable surgical masks , which can offer high levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly ( secured over your mouth , nose , and chin with minimal gaps ) .\nThey are made of the same electrostatic material as N95s , but surgical masks don \u2019 t have the same fit or filters as their higher-quality counterparts .\nCloth masks could be anything from a scrap of T-shirt attached to two ear loops to a bandana .\nThe CDC and other experts say these options offer the least protection against the coronavirus , though there are ways to lock in more protection , like layering it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N95 \u2019 s protection compare to other masks ?\nIn its updated guidance , the CDC says well-fitting N95 respirators give the best protection for yourself and others , followed by KN95s and surgical masks , then cloth masks .\nN95s and KN95s are about 90\u201395 % or more protective against virus particles ( but remember it could vary with KN95s ) , while surgical masks stand in the 50\u201360 % range , Karan said .\nIf you layer them with a cloth mask , you can reach between 70\u201375 % protection .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little as 20-40 % effective , he added .",

        "content": "It \u2019 s two years into the pandemic and babies and toddlers still aren \u2019 t eligible for COVID vaccination \u2014 and many caregivers are feeling incredibly frustrated , hopeless , and defeated about it .\nBuzzFeed News asked readers to tell us how they feel about the vaccine delay and received over 1,000 responses from parents , teachers , and other people who interact with and take care of children .\nWhile we may be only weeks away from a safe and effective vaccine for kids under 5 , many people have felt lost and isolated in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Anne , mom of a 2-year-old .\n\u201c We feel like we are screaming into the void , \u201d said Lauren , mother to an 11-month-old .\n\u201c I feel like the kid who 's excited to hold a bunch of balloons and then watches them pop one by one because of circumstances beyond their control , \u201d said Sabrina , mom of a 3-year-old and a 3-month-old .\nThe FDA was originally expected to authorize the Pfizer COVID vaccine for children 6 months to 4 years old in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government agency indefinitely postponed a meeting , leaving anxious caregivers in the dark .\n\u201c Maybe if we had been told that it could be a long , tiring course , if we had been warned that we would likely see many surges and lulls , maybe then people would be a little more resilient and not so fatigued , \u201d said Carrie Knight , mom of three in Virginia , including a 1-year-old .\n\u201c We were \u2018 all in it together \u2019 in March 2020 .\nBut March 2022 ?\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now.\n\u201d Clinical trials suggested that two doses of a 3-microgram vaccine , which is one-third the adult dose , was safe and effective for babies ages 6 months to one year .\nHowever , in kids ages 2 to 4 , that dosage of the vaccine didn \u2019 t offer enough protection , although it was shown to be safe .\nAt the moment , Pfizer is reviewing the efficacy of a third dose of the vaccine , which is given two months after the second dose .\nAdding a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection and \u201c maximize the risk-benefit profile , \u201d a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News .\nThe company said this data should be ready by early April , which could mean vaccines will be available for kids under 5 around that time .\n( The Pfizer vaccine is already available for kids ages 5 and up . )\nThis week Moderna released its data on vaccines for children under 6 and expects to ask the FDA for authorization \u201c in the coming weeks , \u201d the company said .\nThe vaccine , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult dose , was 43.7 % effective against coronavirus infection primarily caused by the Omicron variant in kids 6 months to 2 years old and 37.5 % effective in those 2 to 5 years old .\n( The Moderna vaccine is currently only available for adults and is about 94 % effective in those who get two doses . )\nMany people acknowledge that the delay means there \u2019 s a better chance the shots will actually protect young children \u2014 most of whom can \u2019 t wear masks because they aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but caregivers also feel forced to depend on others for their child \u2019 s safety , especially those with immunocompromised children .\n\u201c I keep dreaming that it does happen : that [ vaccine ] approval comes , that my child is vaccinated , \u201d said Kelly , 36 , mother to a 1-year-old in Colorado who prefers her last name to stay private .\n\u201c I always wake up so desperate .\nI cry a lot during showers.\n\u201d News of the Pfizer delay came as the deadly Omicron surge was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s now under 1,000 per day ) .\nMore recently , states , schools , and daycares have announced they are no longer requiring people to wear masks indoors .\nCOVID can be a serious risk to children There \u2019 s a common misperception that COVID isn \u2019 t that serious for kids , usually because adults are often much more likely to get sick , be hospitalized , and die from the disease , particularly if they aren \u2019 t vaccinated .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean coronavirus infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A CDC report published March 15 found that children ages 0 to 4 were hospitalized with COVID at a rate five times higher during the Omicron surge compared with that of the Delta variant last year .\nAs of March 24 , 418 children under 5 have died of COVID .\nAbout 20 % of all deaths in children under 18 occurred during Omicron 's dominance .\nThe caregivers we talked to are also concerned about the unknown long-term consequences of infection , including long COVID ; MIS-C ( multisystem inflammatory syndrome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers inflammation in different body parts such as the heart , kidneys , brain , or eyes ; and diabetes .\n( Coronavirus infections seem to raise children \u2019 s risk of the autoimmune condition , Type 1 diabetes , and possibly Type 2 diabetes as well . )\n\u201c I do n't think it 's fair to leave her defenseless against a virus while everyone else gets to have the option to be vaccinated against it , \u201d said Sharon Cook , a 35-year-old mom of a 3-year-old in Maryland .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's health just because some people think children are going to have an easier time with COVID .\nIt 's nobody 's right to roll the dice on my child 's health.\n\u201d As caregivers wait for the FDA to review Pfizer and Moderna \u2019 s data , they \u2019 re especially vigilant of a seemingly more contagious subvariant of Omicron , called BA.2 , that \u2019 s sending coronavirus case trends in the wrong direction in Western Europe .\nIt \u2019 s also spreading steadily in the US , making up about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week ending March 19 .\nWhile feelings are mixed , the delay is a major source of stress for many caregivers who feel the government \u2019 s push to prepandemic normalcy isn \u2019 t considering the approximately 18 million children who fall in this age group .\nPeople of all ages with weakened immune systems are more likely to be hospitalized , need intensive care , require a ventilator , and/or die from COVID , which is why caregivers of immunocompromised babies and toddlers feel even more overlooked and isolated than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLindsay King , who has a 4-year-old daughter , said she was \u201c elated \u201d when the FDA set a review date for the Pfizer COVID vaccine for kids under 5 , but the postponement \u201c felt like the rug was pulled out from under me , \u201d she told us .\n\u201c We special needs parents have been waiting for this a really , really long time.\n\u201d King \u2019 s daughter was diagnosed with autism , \u201c which makes her especially prone to infection due to decreased impulse control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her daughter also has complex Chiari malformation \u2014 a condition that causes the cerebellum , the part of the brain responsible for balance and other motor functions , to push into the spinal cord \u2014 and a tethered spine , which causes chronic constipation and frequent falls .\nThe 36-year-old from Texas said her daughter leaves the house only for doctor appointments and behavioral therapy , so the delay means \u201c many more months of worrying , sleeplessness , ongoing isolation , and emotional deprivation .\n\u201c I feel scared , frustrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\nSome caregivers have had to make the difficult decision to keep their immunocompromised kids from school or other interactions that are necessary for healthy development .\nRachel Hansen of Oregon said her 2-year-old has Down syndrome and a severe heart defect that required two open-heart surgeries that have kept her isolated since birth .\n\u201c Everything in my life is governed by how much it puts my toddler at risk of being around others and potentially getting sick , \u201d Hansen , 26 , said .\n\u201c Once she can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start living life , whereas right now we are stuck in a weird waiting period.\n\u201d In the meantime , Hansen said she will avoid family and continue Zoom playdates and virtual therapy \u2014 a lack of social interaction that has already caused a developmental delay in her daughter \u2019 s ability to interact with others her age , she said .\nFor other caregivers of immunocompromised children , childcare has been one of the biggest challenges , aside from dodging COVID .\nClaire has a 1-year-old with cystic fibrosis , a genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lungs and digestive tract .\nShe told us her son caught a cold at the end of 2021 that took her and her husband away from work often , and stripped her of their nanny who , understandably , didn \u2019 t want to care for a sick child .\n\u201c We had to up his chest physical therapy from 20 minutes , twice a day , to four to fives times per day , \u201d which for a toddler \u201c was like wrestling an alligator , \u201d she said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was miserable and having trouble breathing .\nI \u2019 m terrified of him catching COVID for fear that his little lungs couldn \u2019 t handle it.\n\u201d For Claire , a COVID vaccine means she would feel free from constant worry , be able to take her son to see extended family for the first time , and send her son to daycare , which is less expensive than the nanny she hired , allowing her baby to socialize more with other kids his age .\n\u201c I really wish we could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID , \u201d Claire said .\n\u201c The health and safety of my son and so many others depend on it.\n\u201d People who work with kids are struggling too Abby , a children \u2019 s librarian in Wisconsin who asked that her last name be kept private , said she does seven or more storytimes a week for kids under 5 at a library with no mask mandate .\nWithin that time , she \u2019 ll see about 100 kids and their caregivers .\n\u201c This means myself and my staff are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , singing and reading to them in an enclosed space , \u201d Abby said .\n\u201c At a certain point , it just feels like we 're saying that as a society , we 're cool with sacrificing vulnerable kids ( and grownups with immune system deficiencies and disorders ) for the sake of saying we 're winning the fight against COVID like it 's some kind of contest , \u201d Abby , 38 , told us .\n\u201c We 've already lost .\nWe 've lost so many lives and for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy and humanity.\n\u201d Many teachers feel the same .\nJT Handley , a 23-year-old preschool teacher in Missouri , said they are \u201c stressed and anxious , both for the health and safety of my students and for my current financial situation.\n\u201d Earlier in the year , Handley tested positive for COVID with a mild case and had to miss work for almost an entire pay period ( staff at their school has to take a minimum of five days off with no pay if in direct contact with an infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to average 70 hours per pay period , \u201d said Handley .\n\u201c I earned seven for the period I had COVID.\n\u201d Some people , like J. Lauren Armshaw , 31 , a professional nanny in Louisiana , have had to cut ties with people in their personal lives to protect their professional ones .\nArmshaw said she stopped talking to some people who don \u2019 t share her views on COVID vaccines , in part to protect those she nannies for .\n\u201c The toddlers and babies in my care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t imagine one of them getting COVID and getting very ill , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s scary living in a world where we just don \u2019 t know and people don \u2019 t care.\n\u201d The caregivers who already had COVID For the families lucky enough to have avoided COVID so far , vaccines offer an extra layer of protection against infection , although there \u2019 s no guarantee of that .\nBut for many others who have already tested positive , the shots are what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumatic COVID experience .\nKeith Lieder , 37 , of Michigan , contracted COVID in April 2020 .\nNearly two months later , Lieder lost 30 pounds after weeks of debilitating symptoms that kept him isolated from his two daughters , then 3 years and 6 months old , who were too young to be tested at the time .\nFor two years now , Lieder has had long COVID , experiencing numbness on the right side of his body , sore throat , headaches , nerve pain , and dizziness , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a horrible , horrible struggle mentally and physically .\nI used to be in great shape with no health problems and now every day is a struggle .\nIt breaks my heart to even think about my children or anyone \u2019 s children having to deal with even a fraction of what I and my family have had to go through , \u201d said Lieder , adding that he feels helpless , anxious , and frustrated over the foggy timeline for COVID vaccination for his daughters .\n\u201c And for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children vaccinated as soon as we know it is safe to do so.\n\u201d Whether triggered by the delay or not , some caregivers remain hesitant to vaccinate their kids while others are certain they won \u2019 t .\n\u201c We plan on vaccinating our baby , though we \u2019 d prefer not to be in the \u2018 first wave \u2019 when emergency use is approved , \u201d said Kim V. , 34 , mother to a 7-month-old in Ohio .\n\u201c Vaccinating my child feels different than making the choice to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others are on the fence .\n\u201c Half of me says yes because he does n't know a world without COVID and protocols .\nThe other half of me says no because he is so young and if he had an adverse reaction it would kill me , \u201d said Ali Morin , 28 , mom to a 2-year-old .\nMeanwhile , many caregivers say they are not anti-vaccine , but anti\u2013COVID vaccine , sharing that they feel the coronavirus shots were developed too quickly or that they feel the risks for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pediatric hospitalist at the University of Texas \u2019 s Dell Children \u2019 s Medical Center and professor at the Dell Medical School , said she worries the delay is \u201c giving people pause , \u201d but that \u201c this is truly what transparency and science looks like.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s disappointing as a pediatrician and parent of two kids that fall in this age range , but I think that the delay to me is evidence of the rigor and safety of the overall process , \u201d Gambill said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to be frustrated , but this reassures me that when the vaccine is available it will , without a doubt , work and be safe .\n\u201d",

        "content": "As bedtime approaches , it \u2019 s easy to understand why harried parents of young children may consider giving them flavored melatonin drops or gummies , which are specifically intended to help kiddos sleep .\nMelatonin supplements are available in the supplement aisle of almost every pharmacy and are marketed to parents everywhere .\nThere are people on TikTok who promote their use in kids , while others say not so fast .\nSo is it really a good idea to give a synthetic hormone to babies , toddlers , or even adolescents in the search of a better night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension , yourself ?\nHere \u2019 s what you should know before you try it .\nWhat is melatonin , exactly ?\nMelatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland , which is lodged deep in the center of the brain .\nThe hormone rises and falls in sync with night and day .\n\u201c Melatonin is triggered by light and dark , \u201d said Dr. Steven H. Feinsilver , director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .\n\u201c The response of the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to produce more melatonin which [ facilitates ] sleep onset.\n\u201d The light of day suppresses melatonin production , easing you into wakefulness .\nMelatonin supplements are designed to mimic the natural hormone .\nWhile quite a bit is known about melatonin supplements in adults , it \u2019 s less studied in kids .\nHowever , experts agree that they should not be given to children under age 3 .\nBefore you give a child melatonin , talk to their doctor first The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents try melatonin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pediatrician .\nThat way , they can investigate whether the child has a medical disorder that \u2019 s interfering with sleep .\n\u201c Melatonin may not be the right approach for some underlying sleep problems like sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome , \u201d said Dr. Kori Flower , a professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine .\nAnd it may not be right if the insomnia is caused by an infection or identifiable anxiety , like a looming test at school .\nWhy melatonin supplements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are considering giving a child melatonin , again , they need to be at least 3 years old , said Dr. Shalini Paruthi , a spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine .\nChildren under age 3 have relatively unformed neurological and endocrine systems , Paruthi said .\n\u201c The best strategy for young children and infants is to help them to have their own brains produce their own melatonin , \u201d Flower said .\n\u201c The best thing is to rely on their own bodies.\n\u201d Look for behavioral solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to try behavioral and \u201c sleep hygiene \u201d measures before turning to supplements .\nIt helps to establish a bedtime routine for your child .\nThat means going to bed and waking up at the same time every day and removing phones , tablets , TVs , and computers an hour before bedtime .\n\u201c This is really hard but really important , \u201d Flower said .\n\u201c The blue light will suppress the production of melatonin and the stimulation from the electronics continues to occur in the brain after the devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get plenty of exercise earlier in the day and avoid caffeinated snacks and drinks ( including soda , some types of chocolate , and sweet tea ) .\nOlder children may need less sleep so it \u2019 s OK to skip a nap after school if they sleep better at night .\nThe AAP says that melatonin supplements may be used in the short term for children with sleep problems .\nThis is based on limited research showing melatonin might speed up sleep onset and help kids sleep longer .\nThe biggest gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders , although the hormone doesn \u2019 t affect core symptoms .\n\u201c There is a subset of children on the autism spectrum disorder who may benefit from a small dose of melatonin , \u201d said Paruthi , who is also co-director of the Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke \u2019 s Hospital and adjunct associate professor at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine .\n\u201c Studies do show that up to 40 % to 80 % of children on the autism spectrum may have insomnia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems in their pathway of producing melatonin in their brain.\n\u201d Small doses of melatonin in the evening along with bright light in the morning may help postpubescent children with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder ( for example , a teenager who stays up late and sleeps in until the afternoon ) , Paruthi said .\nIn both cases , melatonin should be given with a doctor \u2019 s supervision .\nNo one knows exactly how much melatonin is the right amount , so if you decide to try melatonin supplementation , start low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their child is having great difficulty falling asleep despite excellent sleep hygiene and a great bedtime routine , it may be reasonable to purchase over-the-counter melatonin , and try 1 to 3 mg for up to one or two weeks , \u201d Paruthi said .\nIf the sleep problems persist for longer than about two weeks , follow back up with your pediatrician .\nPay attention to formulations as well .\nWhile \u201c immediate-release \u201d versions may help you fall asleep , they don \u2019 t necessarily keep you asleep through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melatonin in children have only looked at it for short periods of time .\nAt least for temporary use , the research indicates that it \u2019 s generally safe , though it can cause side effects like headaches , dizziness , agitation , and bedwetting .\nAll of these tend to go away when the melatonin is stopped .\nPeople have expressed concern that long-term use of melatonin supplements may delay sexual development when given to prepubescent children , but there \u2019 s not enough data in humans to confirm or deny this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that melatonin can interact with anti-seizure medications and blood thinners , which is another reason to consult a healthcare professional .\nYou may not be able to trust the products Even though supplements are widely available , remember that the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate supplements like it does prescription medications .\nThat means you may not know exactly what you \u2019 re getting when you buy an over-the-counter product .\nOne study of 31 products found that almost three-quarters contained melatonin content at least 10 % greater or lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melatonin content was as high as 478 % above the label .\nAbout a quarter of products also contained the mood-altering hormone serotonin .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to recognize that melatonin is not regulated by the FDA , \u201d Paruthi said .\n\u201c Therefore , there is no guarantee that the melatonin you find between brands , between bottles , or between tablets/liquid is equivalent.\n\u201d The take-home message is don \u2019 t give melatonin supplements to babies , but it may sometimes be appropriate for older kids .\n\u201c Melatonin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time may be safe for some children , \u201d Paruthi said .\n\u201c Unfortunately , there is a lack of large randomized controlled trials across the different development stages in children , so at this time , we are not able to definitively say which children will benefit from melatonin and how safe it is in terms of possible short-term or long-term side effects.\n\u201d In other words , parents and caregivers should use melatonin supplements with caution and talk to their doctor first .",

deal with an eating disorder ?\n\u201c Recovering from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguity of it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c If you get sober from substances , you have a sobriety date .\nI get sober from substances , and I 'm not taking the substances anymore .\nWith eating it 's a wide range.\n\u201d Treating her substance abuse had an unexpected side effect , Sophie told me .\nIn the 14 months since she got sober , her disordered eating has started to just simply fall away .\nAddressing the underlying issues brought up by her sobriety also inherently addressed the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still thinks a lot about food and her body .\nThat , she said , is another overlap with her substance addiction .\n\u201c You 're predisposed to want control and to want to escape your reality , \u201d she said .\nAnd dealing with that \u201c does n't have a date .\nThat does n't have any sort of timeline.\n\u201d I used to think of recovery as a peak I would reach , after which point I would never have to think about any of this food bullshit ever again .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ like recovery is a cyclical state , with seasons that mirror nature \u2019 s own .\nTwo years into the pandemic , I \u2019 m riding the recovery loop again , this time with just enough experience to recognize this shifting form of my recovery for what it is : not a failing , but a deepening and a widening .\nI have a community of other people in recovery and the support of professionals to help me catch myself before I fall too far , and I now know that eating disorders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the signs that I need help more clearly now .\nBut strangely , I \u2019 ve begun to feel that giving up my idea of a perfect recovery has been the most helpful piece of all .\nI explained to Sophie my metaphor of recovery as cyclical and seasonal .\nShe proposed a different one , explaining that her life used to feel like big peaks and valleys .\n\u201c What 's talked about with recovery is that it 's like this \u201d \u2014 she drew a line across the screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 \u201c I like this model , because you 're still progressing , you 're still moving forward.\n\u201d Inherent in the idea of a complete recovery is a complete relapse .\nBut Sophie described a kind of endless , ever-present recovery that can hold a lapse ( or lapses ) within it .\nIt \u2019 s a flexible sense of recovery that many substance abuse treatment experts say is , perhaps counterintuitively , very valuable .\n\u201c One of the first things I tell all my clients regardless of their presenting issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps forward and I normalize and help them to expect taking steps backwards , \u201d Michelle Callahan , a substance abuse treatment therapist in Pennsylvania , told me via email .\n\u201c Talking about this from the beginning helps to immediately reframe and shift the thinking when they do take steps backwards.\n\u201d Not having that sense from the start can make people who relapse feel immense shame , and that their treatment and recovery was \u201c for nothing , \u201d Callahan said .\nShe likes to draw a difference between lapses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead be seen as a lapse or a hiccup rather than a relapse and having to start treatment over , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c They can also feel like they are a failure , are bad , or weak , which are likely the core beliefs that pushed them into addiction or engaging in their problematic behaviors in the first place.\n\u201d The sense of completely starting over , Callahan said , can also be too overwhelming and turn people off from getting help or treatment .\nThe difference she draws between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she often discusses in her sobriety community : Lapses ( and even full-on relapses ) can be seen not as a personal failing , but instead research that helps you understand yourself and addiction in a new light , in service of your ultimate healing .\nLast December , I experienced an unexplainable bout of exhaustion that I assumed was the latest round of pandemic burnout .\nTwo weeks later , in the emergency room just before Christmas , I learned it was actually a UTI that , left untreated , had progressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , the antibiotics I \u2019 d been put on gave me a yeast infection .\nTwo days after that , I tested positive for COVID .\nThis cascading series of illnesses necessitated the longest break from exercise I \u2019 ve taken in my adult life \u2014 with the notable forced exception of cracking my hip in half .\nIt brought to light the places in my recovery that I \u2019 ve merely band-aided over rather than truly dealt with .\nI had intrusive thoughts about food I thought I \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations with my partner about the line between healthy and compulsive exercise .",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans spent the third day of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2019 s US Supreme Court confirmation hearings airing political and policy grievances that she explained she had no firsthand knowledge of and no authority over \u2014 like Democrats \u2019 treatment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was a nominee \u2014 at times pointing out that they were raising issues that Congress had created or could solve .\nWednesday \u2019 s hearing covered much of the same ground that both parties had hashed out in their opening statements and the first round of questions for Jackson a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jackson \u2019 s testimony offered senators another chance to explore her thinking and her decisions in cases she \u2019 d handled as a lower court judge or to drill down on broader points they wanted to make , some of which were related to Jackson \u2019 s record and what she \u2019 d be like as a justice , and some not .\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham used part of his time to angrily rehash Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation proceedings , during which a woman who \u2019 d known the now-justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blasey Ford , came forward with an allegation that he attempted to sexually assault her decades ago at a high school party ; Kavanaugh denied the claim .\nGraham initially tried to get Jackson to say how she \u2019 d feel about a hypothetical scenario where someone came forward with an accusation against her at the end of her hearings that she couldn \u2019 t address ; she said she didn \u2019 t understand the question .\nGraham then directly asked if she \u2019 d watched Kavanaugh \u2019 s hearings .\nShe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarify that she was generally familiar with what happened .\nWhen she attempted to shift the focus back to her own nomination , saying she \u2019 d appreciated the kindness that members , including Graham , had shown her during one-on-one meetings , he pulled the discussion back to Kavanaugh .\nFinally , Jackson explained that she didn \u2019 t \u201c have any comment on what procedures took place in this body regarding Justice Kavanaugh.\n\u201d Graham also focused his time Wednesday on what \u2019 s become a leading Republican line of attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people convicted of child sex abuse images offenses and her work on policy issues related to those types of cases as a member of the US Sentencing Commission .\nJackson delved into some of the nuances of these decisions , including that Congress had empowered judges to use a variety of tools besides prison time to achieve the goals of punishment \u2014 such as long-term computer monitoring \u2014 and that the sentencing guidelines were based on a pre-internet era that didn \u2019 t reflect how these offenses were now committed .\nThroughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were \u201c horrible \u201d crimes , but explained that judges were trying to apply a \u201c rational \u201d system for sentencing and to find ways of identifying different categories of offenders and sentencing them appropriately .\nGraham suggested that she did not consider the distribution of child sex abuse materials to be a \u201c bad thing \u201d before outright accusing her of such .\nFederal sentencing experts have described Jackson \u2019 s sentencing practices in cases of child sex abuse materials as \u201c mainstream , \u201d pointing out that the majority of federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases that don \u2019 t involve people charged with actually producing content .\n( Judges aren \u2019 t required to follow these guidelines , but they \u2019 re meant to ensure some consistency across the criminal justice system . )\nNear the end of Graham \u2019 s questioning , which saw him repeatedly interrupt Jackson , Sen. Dick Durbin , the Democratic chair of the committee , jumped in to point out that Congress had \u201c failed \u201d to update federal criminal laws related to offenses of child sex abuse materials in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c This is our fault ?\n\u201d Durbin replied : \u201c Partially it is , senator .\nTo be honest with you , it is.\n\u201d She talked again about the balancing test that Congress had laid out when questioned by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley about sentences in cases regarding child sex abuse images .\nHawley tweeted a thread last weekend highlighting these cases , putting him at the forefront of this line of attack against Jackson .\nThe nominee noted that Hawley \u2019 s accusations that her sentences were too low failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required to consider , including arguments from defense lawyers .\nShe called out Hawley for repeatedly asking her questions that he and other Republican members had already posed and that she \u2019 d already answered .\nHawley suggested that the fact that the internet had made this type of crime so much easier to commit was a reason to impose tougher sentences .\nJackson replied , \u201c Senator , the Congress has every ability to do that.\n\u201d North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis questioned Jackson \u2019 s handling of criminal cases more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off too easy : \u201c It seems as though you are a very kind person and that there is at least a level of empathy that enters into your treatment of a defendant that some could view as maybe beyond what some of us would be comfortable with , with respect to administering justice.\n\u201d Jackson replied that her approach to sentencing was \u201c within the framework that Congress has provided.\n\u201d She said that , by law , Congress directed judges to balance a range of factors in crafting a sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics , and that Congress had required judges to impose sentences that were \u201c sufficient but not greater than necessary to promote the purposes of punishment.\n\u201d She pointed out that she had , in fact , ordered lengthy prison terms in some cases , and that in criminal cases she wanted defendants to feel that they were heard and to spend time talking through the consequences of their crimes in the hopes of preventing them from doing it again in the future .\nTennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn asked the nominee how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow some people convicted of serious crimes , including violent offenses , to be released from prison , referring to cases where Jackson had granted compassionate release petitions during the pandemic .\nJackson noted that Congress had made a policy decision to allow people to seek early release in these types of situations .\nIowa Sen. Chuck Grassley asked if Jackson believed nationwide injunctions by judges were constitutional , referring to a common conservative criticism when federal judges blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a number of policies .\nJackson replied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t quite right \u2014 that when judges invalidated federal agency rules under the Administrative Procedure Act , and those decisions had a nationwide effect , they were carrying out a remedy that Congress had adopted as part of that law .\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy pressed Jackson to share her views on whether there should be more justices on the Supreme Court , often referred to as \u201c court-packing.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a proposal that \u2019 s gained traction among liberal advocacy groups and some Democratic members of Congress as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6\u20133 conservative majority .\nJackson offered a brief summary of the case for and against adding justices but declined to share her opinion about court-packing , saying she didn \u2019 t think it would be appropriate to weigh in on a matter that was ultimately up to Congress .\nKennedy pressed her on that answer , asking with skepticism if it wouldn \u2019 t make a difference to Jackson if she was one of nine or one of 28 justices .\n\u201c I would be thrilled to be one of however many Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , \u201d Jackson replied .\nKennedy pushed again : \u201c So you \u2019 d be okay if it was 28 ?\n\u201d Jackson \u2019 s confirmation hearing will resume Thursday for a fourth and final day , but she \u2019 s done answering questions ; the senators will hear last from a string of witnesses speaking for and against her nomination .",

        "content": "It \u2019 s two years into the pandemic and babies and toddlers still aren \u2019 t eligible for COVID vaccination \u2014 and many caregivers are feeling incredibly frustrated , hopeless , and defeated about it .\nBuzzFeed News asked readers to tell us how they feel about the vaccine delay and received over 1,000 responses from parents , teachers , and other people who interact with and take care of children .\nWhile we may be only weeks away from a safe and effective vaccine for kids under 5 , many people have felt lost and isolated in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Anne , mom of a 2-year-old .\n\u201c We feel like we are screaming into the void , \u201d said Lauren , mother to an 11-month-old .\n\u201c I feel like the kid who 's excited to hold a bunch of balloons and then watches them pop one by one because of circumstances beyond their control , \u201d said Sabrina , mom of a 3-year-old and a 3-month-old .\nThe FDA was originally expected to authorize the Pfizer COVID vaccine for children 6 months to 4 years old in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government agency indefinitely postponed a meeting , leaving anxious caregivers in the dark .\n\u201c Maybe if we had been told that it could be a long , tiring course , if we had been warned that we would likely see many surges and lulls , maybe then people would be a little more resilient and not so fatigued , \u201d said Carrie Knight , mom of three in Virginia , including a 1-year-old .\n\u201c We were \u2018 all in it together \u2019 in March 2020 .\nBut March 2022 ?\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now.\n\u201d Clinical trials suggested that two doses of a 3-microgram vaccine , which is one-third the adult dose , was safe and effective for babies ages 6 months to one year .\nHowever , in kids ages 2 to 4 , that dosage of the vaccine didn \u2019 t offer enough protection , although it was shown to be safe .\nAt the moment , Pfizer is reviewing the efficacy of a third dose of the vaccine , which is given two months after the second dose .\nAdding a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection and \u201c maximize the risk-benefit profile , \u201d a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News .\nThe company said this data should be ready by early April , which could mean vaccines will be available for kids under 5 around that time .\n( The Pfizer vaccine is already available for kids ages 5 and up . )\nThis week Moderna released its data on vaccines for children under 6 and expects to ask the FDA for authorization \u201c in the coming weeks , \u201d the company said .\nThe vaccine , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult dose , was 43.7 % effective against coronavirus infection primarily caused by the Omicron variant in kids 6 months to 2 years old and 37.5 % effective in those 2 to 5 years old .\n( The Moderna vaccine is currently only available for adults and is about 94 % effective in those who get two doses . )\nMany people acknowledge that the delay means there \u2019 s a better chance the shots will actually protect young children \u2014 most of whom can \u2019 t wear masks because they aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but caregivers also feel forced to depend on others for their child \u2019 s safety , especially those with immunocompromised children .\n\u201c I keep dreaming that it does happen : that [ vaccine ] approval comes , that my child is vaccinated , \u201d said Kelly , 36 , mother to a 1-year-old in Colorado who prefers her last name to stay private .\n\u201c I always wake up so desperate .\nI cry a lot during showers.\n\u201d News of the Pfizer delay came as the deadly Omicron surge was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s now under 1,000 per day ) .\nMore recently , states , schools , and daycares have announced they are no longer requiring people to wear masks indoors .\nCOVID can be a serious risk to children There \u2019 s a common misperception that COVID isn \u2019 t that serious for kids , usually because adults are often much more likely to get sick , be hospitalized , and die from the disease , particularly if they aren \u2019 t vaccinated .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean coronavirus infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A CDC report published March 15 found that children ages 0 to 4 were hospitalized with COVID at a rate five times higher during the Omicron surge compared with that of the Delta variant last year .\nAs of March 24 , 418 children under 5 have died of COVID .\nAbout 20 % of all deaths in children under 18 occurred during Omicron 's dominance .\nThe caregivers we talked to are also concerned about the unknown long-term consequences of infection , including long COVID ; MIS-C ( multisystem inflammatory syndrome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers inflammation in different body parts such as the heart , kidneys , brain , or eyes ; and diabetes .\n( Coronavirus infections seem to raise children \u2019 s risk of the autoimmune condition , Type 1 diabetes , and possibly Type 2 diabetes as well . )\n\u201c I do n't think it 's fair to leave her defenseless against a virus while everyone else gets to have the option to be vaccinated against it , \u201d said Sharon Cook , a 35-year-old mom of a 3-year-old in Maryland .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's health just because some people think children are going to have an easier time with COVID .\nIt 's nobody 's right to roll the dice on my child 's health.\n\u201d As caregivers wait for the FDA to review Pfizer and Moderna \u2019 s data , they \u2019 re especially vigilant of a seemingly more contagious subvariant of Omicron , called BA.2 , that \u2019 s sending coronavirus case trends in the wrong direction in Western Europe .\nIt \u2019 s also spreading steadily in the US , making up about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week ending March 19 .\nWhile feelings are mixed , the delay is a major source of stress for many caregivers who feel the government \u2019 s push to prepandemic normalcy isn \u2019 t considering the approximately 18 million children who fall in this age group .\nPeople of all ages with weakened immune systems are more likely to be hospitalized , need intensive care , require a ventilator , and/or die from COVID , which is why caregivers of immunocompromised babies and toddlers feel even more overlooked and isolated than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLindsay King , who has a 4-year-old daughter , said she was \u201c elated \u201d when the FDA set a review date for the Pfizer COVID vaccine for kids under 5 , but the postponement \u201c felt like the rug was pulled out from under me , \u201d she told us .\n\u201c We special needs parents have been waiting for this a really , really long time.\n\u201d King \u2019 s daughter was diagnosed with autism , \u201c which makes her especially prone to infection due to decreased impulse control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her daughter also has complex Chiari malformation \u2014 a condition that causes the cerebellum , the part of the brain responsible for balance and other motor functions , to push into the spinal cord \u2014 and a tethered spine , which causes chronic constipation and frequent falls .\nThe 36-year-old from Texas said her daughter leaves the house only for doctor appointments and behavioral therapy , so the delay means \u201c many more months of worrying , sleeplessness , ongoing isolation , and emotional deprivation .\n\u201c I feel scared , frustrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\nSome caregivers have had to make the difficult decision to keep their immunocompromised kids from school or other interactions that are necessary for healthy development .\nRachel Hansen of Oregon said her 2-year-old has Down syndrome and a severe heart defect that required two open-heart surgeries that have kept her isolated since birth .\n\u201c Everything in my life is governed by how much it puts my toddler at risk of being around others and potentially getting sick , \u201d Hansen , 26 , said .\n\u201c Once she can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start living life , whereas right now we are stuck in a weird waiting period.\n\u201d In the meantime , Hansen said she will avoid family and continue Zoom playdates and virtual therapy \u2014 a lack of social interaction that has already caused a developmental delay in her daughter \u2019 s ability to interact with others her age , she said .\nFor other caregivers of immunocompromised children , childcare has been one of the biggest challenges , aside from dodging COVID .\nClaire has a 1-year-old with cystic fibrosis , a genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lungs and digestive tract .\nShe told us her son caught a cold at the end of 2021 that took her and her husband away from work often , and stripped her of their nanny who , understandably , didn \u2019 t want to care for a sick child .\n\u201c We had to up his chest physical therapy from 20 minutes , twice a day , to four to fives times per day , \u201d which for a toddler \u201c was like wrestling an alligator , \u201d she said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was miserable and having trouble breathing .\nI \u2019 m terrified of him catching COVID for fear that his little lungs couldn \u2019 t handle it.\n\u201d For Claire , a COVID vaccine means she would feel free from constant worry , be able to take her son to see extended family for the first time , and send her son to daycare , which is less expensive than the nanny she hired , allowing her baby to socialize more with other kids his age .\n\u201c I really wish we could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID , \u201d Claire said .\n\u201c The health and safety of my son and so many others depend on it.\n\u201d People who work with kids are struggling too Abby , a children \u2019 s librarian in Wisconsin who asked that her last name be kept private , said she does seven or more storytimes a week for kids under 5 at a library with no mask mandate .\nWithin that time , she \u2019 ll see about 100 kids and their caregivers .\n\u201c This means myself and my staff are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , singing and reading to them in an enclosed space , \u201d Abby said .\n\u201c At a certain point , it just feels like we 're saying that as a society , we 're cool with sacrificing vulnerable kids ( and grownups with immune system deficiencies and disorders ) for the sake of saying we 're winning the fight against COVID like it 's some kind of contest , \u201d Abby , 38 , told us .\n\u201c We 've already lost .\nWe 've lost so many lives and for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy and humanity.\n\u201d Many teachers feel the same .\nJT Handley , a 23-year-old preschool teacher in Missouri , said they are \u201c stressed and anxious , both for the health and safety of my students and for my current financial situation.\n\u201d Earlier in the year , Handley tested positive for COVID with a mild case and had to miss work for almost an entire pay period ( staff at their school has to take a minimum of five days off with no pay if in direct contact with an infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to average 70 hours per pay period , \u201d said Handley .\n\u201c I earned seven for the period I had COVID.\n\u201d Some people , like J. Lauren Armshaw , 31 , a professional nanny in Louisiana , have had to cut ties with people in their personal lives to protect their professional ones .\nArmshaw said she stopped talking to some people who don \u2019 t share her views on COVID vaccines , in part to protect those she nannies for .\n\u201c The toddlers and babies in my care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t imagine one of them getting COVID and getting very ill , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s scary living in a world where we just don \u2019 t know and people don \u2019 t care.\n\u201d The caregivers who already had COVID For the families lucky enough to have avoided COVID so far , vaccines offer an extra layer of protection against infection , although there \u2019 s no guarantee of that .\nBut for many others who have already tested positive , the shots are what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumatic COVID experience .\nKeith Lieder , 37 , of Michigan , contracted COVID in April 2020 .\nNearly two months later , Lieder lost 30 pounds after weeks of debilitating symptoms that kept him isolated from his two daughters , then 3 years and 6 months old , who were too young to be tested at the time .\nFor two years now , Lieder has had long COVID , experiencing numbness on the right side of his body , sore throat , headaches , nerve pain , and dizziness , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a horrible , horrible struggle mentally and physically .\nI used to be in great shape with no health problems and now every day is a struggle .\nIt breaks my heart to even think about my children or anyone \u2019 s children having to deal with even a fraction of what I and my family have had to go through , \u201d said Lieder , adding that he feels helpless , anxious , and frustrated over the foggy timeline for COVID vaccination for his daughters .\n\u201c And for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children vaccinated as soon as we know it is safe to do so.\n\u201d Whether triggered by the delay or not , some caregivers remain hesitant to vaccinate their kids while others are certain they won \u2019 t .\n\u201c We plan on vaccinating our baby , though we \u2019 d prefer not to be in the \u2018 first wave \u2019 when emergency use is approved , \u201d said Kim V. , 34 , mother to a 7-month-old in Ohio .\n\u201c Vaccinating my child feels different than making the choice to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others are on the fence .\n\u201c Half of me says yes because he does n't know a world without COVID and protocols .\nThe other half of me says no because he is so young and if he had an adverse reaction it would kill me , \u201d said Ali Morin , 28 , mom to a 2-year-old .\nMeanwhile , many caregivers say they are not anti-vaccine , but anti\u2013COVID vaccine , sharing that they feel the coronavirus shots were developed too quickly or that they feel the risks for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pediatric hospitalist at the University of Texas \u2019 s Dell Children \u2019 s Medical Center and professor at the Dell Medical School , said she worries the delay is \u201c giving people pause , \u201d but that \u201c this is truly what transparency and science looks like.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s disappointing as a pediatrician and parent of two kids that fall in this age range , but I think that the delay to me is evidence of the rigor and safety of the overall process , \u201d Gambill said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to be frustrated , but this reassures me that when the vaccine is available it will , without a doubt , work and be safe .\n\u201d",

        "content": "A DHS official confirmed that the agency had \u201c temporarily paused the court-ordered reimplementation of MPP in the Laredo sector to ensure the safety of migrants in light of recent violence in Nuevo Laredo.\n\u201d The email obtained by BuzzFeed News recommends resuming sending immigrants to Nuevo Laredo on March 28 if the security situation has been resolved .\nSince the return of Remain in Mexico , hundreds of immigrants have been forced back across the border , with a small portion of them being sent to Nuevo Laredo .\nImmigrant advocates , along with those within the Biden administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violating the law by blocking immigrants from full access to the US asylum system .\nAdministration officials have also said the program places immigrants in dangerous situations in Mexico where the US is limited in its ability to help .\n\u201c Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas has repeatedly stated that MPP has endemic flaws , imposed unjustifiable human costs , pulled resources and personnel away from other priority efforts , and failed to address the root causes of irregular migration .\nDHS , however , is under a court order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight in the courts , including in a challenge before the Supreme Court , \u201d a DHS spokesperson said in a statement .\n\u201c In the interim , the Department is required to abide by the order to re-implement the program in good faith .\nAs it does so , the Department is committed to implementing MPP in the most humane way possible.\n\u201d Immigrant advocates have felt that Remain in Mexico had largely avoided the level of outrage it deserved after more than 60,000 asylum-seekers were sent back as part of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deter migration at the southern border .\nWhile in Mexico , those immigrants faced rape , kidnappings , and murder , according to groups who documented the problems .\nThe email to Nu\u00f1ez-Neto documents how the conditions in parts of the Mexican border continue to remain precarious .\n\u201c I think this highlights once again how dangerous this particular city is , \u201d said Stephanie Leutert , a former Biden administration official and the director of the Central America and Mexico Policy Initiative at the University of Texas .\n\u201c We know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for migrants , but Nuevo Laredo has a unique security environment where people returned there are especially vulnerable for crimes by the criminal group that controls the territory.\n\u201d Leutert wrote a report in December that found that there were more than 130 people who had been kidnapped in Nuevo Laredo after being sent there under the Remain in Mexico program .\nBetween 2019 and 2021 , more than 11,500 people were sent to the border city , according to the report .\nLeutert found that the kidnapped immigrants included families and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elsewhere .\nShe also documented how those forced back under Title 42 \u2014 an obscure public health law that was invoked to stop the spread of COVID \u2014 had also been kidnapped .\n\u201c With each new U.S. policy that sends individuals back to Nuevo Laredo , there is a new migrant population that is at-risk for being kidnapped , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c Over the long term , the only way to reduce these kidnappings is for the Mexican government to foster sustainable improvements in the security situation or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the city .\nHowever , in the meantime , migrant kidnappings in Nuevo Laredo are likely to continue.\n\u201d The return of the Remain in Mexico policy was something the Biden administration has long opposed publicly .\nIn August , US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ordered the government to restart the program until it could be rescinded in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act .\nHis order went into effect shortly afterward .\nEarlier in 2021 , the Biden administration began to undo MPP by allowing thousands of people caught up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US .\nAnd in June , Mayorkas issued a memo officially ending the policy .\nThe case has since moved to the Supreme Court , which will hear arguments later this spring .\nThe program has also come under heavy criticism within the government .\nThe union representing asylum officers wrote in a statement that the policy \u2019 s return will make officers \u201c complicit in violations of U.S. federal law and binding international treaty obligations of non-refoulement that they have sworn to uphold.\n\u201d The Biden administration has highlighted many changes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese include improved access to legal representatives , more information about the program given to immigrants , and a speedier court hearing process .\nBut perhaps most consequential will be the practice of border officials asking questions to figure out if immigrants are fearful of being returned to Mexico , which was not the case under Trump .\nImmigrants who say yes will have the opportunity to be screened by asylum officers to prove their claim .\nUnder the new DHS guidance , vulnerable immigrants , such as those with known physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be exempted from Remain in Mexico .\nAn internal government report obtained by BuzzFeed News found that while those with \u201c known physical/mental health issues \u201d were also prohibited under the Trump version of MPP from being sent back , border officials placed them in the program anyway .\nThe Trump administration implemented the controversial program in early 2019 amid a surge of families crossing the border and claiming asylum .\nAt the time , the US was seeing upward of 100,000 border crossings a month .",

descriptions of purported election fraud at the state level by state lawmakers and resolutions passed by state legislatures ; technical analysis of voting machines ; memos specifically created to be passed around to members of Congress ; requests for contact information of Eastman , Trump , or other people or outside offers to help Eastman ; and news reports and press releases .\nThe judge then focused on 13 documents where he agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected because they were \u201c clearly \u201d related to litigation and were prepared by or for representatives of Trump or his campaign , including other attorneys who were working with Trump or involved in pending state court cases at the time .\nTwo of those documents were no longer protected because they \u2019 d become public , including a Nov. 18 , 2020 , memo that laid out a strategy for preparing an alternate slate of pro-Trump electors in Wisconsin .\nThat left 11 documents on the table .\nThe Jan. 6 committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn \u2019 t be privileged because they fell under what \u2019 s known as the \u201c crime-fraud exception , \u201d meaning that a client had asked for a lawyer \u2019 s advice that would help them commit a crime or the messages generally were \u201c in furtherance of \u201d criminal activity .\nTo apply that exception , courts apply a lower burden of proof than the one prosecutors have to meet to win a conviction in court \u2014 the Jan. 6 committee had to show Trump and Eastman \u201c more likely than not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evidence , \u201d as opposed to having to prove a case \u201c beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\u201d Carter found that the committee had cleared the bar for showing Trump likely tried to obstruct an official proceeding \u2014 a felony crime that hundreds of people are charged with who descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6 \u2014 and that Trump , Eastman , and others conspired to defraud the United States by interfering with the election certification , also a felony carrying up to five years in prison .\nThe judge focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d to convince Pence to take steps to block the certification of Biden \u2019 s win .\nTrump likely knew that his claims of widespread voter fraud were bogus given the evidence of public and private pushback he encountered from various advisers , plus the dozens of losses in court to legal challenges raised by Trump and others , the judge wrote .\nHe noted Trump \u2019 s widely reported call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger focused on what Trump identified as the roughly 11,000 votes he believed he needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud .\nTrump was entitled to argue about the law in court , Carter wrote , but his efforts with Eastman to undermine the federal Electoral Count Act went beyond that .\n\u201c The illegality of the plan was obvious .\nOur nation was founded on the peaceful transition of power , epitomized by George Washington laying down his sword to make way for democratic elections .\nIgnoring this history , President Trump vigorously campaigned for the Vice President to single-handedly determine the results of the 2020 election , \u201d Carter wrote .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the remaining 11 that related to the crimes the committee had identified and that Eastman would have to turn over : a draft memo that had been written for Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and forwarded to Eastman that laid out the case for Pence rejecting electors from states where Trump was contesting Biden \u2019 s wins .\n\u201c This may have been the first time members of President Trump \u2019 s team transformed a legal interpretation of the Electoral Count Act into a day-by-day plan of action .\nThe draft memo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral Count Act , and Dr. Eastman \u2019 s later memos closely track its analysis and proposal , \u201d Carter wrote .\nAs for the remaining 10 documents , the judge found that they would remain privileged and out of the committee \u2019 s hands .\nHe wrote that nine of them were related to the legal efforts in court to contest election results , and that while they may have featured some of the baseless voter fraud claims , pursuing challenges in court wasn \u2019 t part of the alleged criminal scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an email sent by someone after Congress had resumed certifying the election results on the night of Jan. 6 , so the judge held it couldn \u2019 t be considered part of any ongoing criminal effort at that point to convince Pence to reject certification .",

requests for contact information of Eastman , Trump , or other people or outside offers to help Eastman ; and news reports and press releases .\nThe judge then focused on 13 documents where he agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected because they were \u201c clearly \u201d related to litigation and were prepared by or for representatives of Trump or his campaign , including other attorneys who were working with Trump or involved in pending state court cases at the time .\nTwo of those documents were no longer protected because they \u2019 d become public , including a Nov. 18 , 2020 , memo that laid out a strategy for preparing an alternate slate of pro-Trump electors in Wisconsin .\nThat left 11 documents on the table .\nThe Jan. 6 committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn \u2019 t be privileged because they fell under what \u2019 s known as the \u201c crime-fraud exception , \u201d meaning that a client had asked for a lawyer \u2019 s advice that would help them commit a crime or the messages generally were \u201c in furtherance of \u201d criminal activity .\nTo apply that exception , courts apply a lower burden of proof than the one prosecutors have to meet to win a conviction in court \u2014 the Jan. 6 committee had to show Trump and Eastman \u201c more likely than not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evidence , \u201d as opposed to having to prove a case \u201c beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\u201d Carter found that the committee had cleared the bar for showing Trump likely tried to obstruct an official proceeding \u2014 a felony crime that hundreds of people are charged with who descended on the Capitol on Jan. 6 \u2014 and that Trump , Eastman , and others conspired to defraud the United States by interfering with the election certification , also a felony carrying up to five years in prison .\nThe judge focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d to convince Pence to take steps to block the certification of Biden \u2019 s win .\nTrump likely knew that his claims of widespread voter fraud were bogus given the evidence of public and private pushback he encountered from various advisers , plus the dozens of losses in court to legal challenges raised by Trump and others , the judge wrote .\nHe noted Trump \u2019 s widely reported call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger focused on what Trump identified as the roughly 11,000 votes he believed he needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud .\nTrump was entitled to argue about the law in court , Carter wrote , but his efforts with Eastman to undermine the federal Electoral Count Act went beyond that .\n\u201c The illegality of the plan was obvious .\nOur nation was founded on the peaceful transition of power , epitomized by George Washington laying down his sword to make way for democratic elections .\nIgnoring this history , President Trump vigorously campaigned for the Vice President to single-handedly determine the results of the 2020 election , \u201d Carter wrote .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the remaining 11 that related to the crimes the committee had identified and that Eastman would have to turn over : a draft memo that had been written for Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and forwarded to Eastman that laid out the case for Pence rejecting electors from states where Trump was contesting Biden \u2019 s wins .\n\u201c This may have been the first time members of President Trump \u2019 s team transformed a legal interpretation of the Electoral Count Act into a day-by-day plan of action .\nThe draft memo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral Count Act , and Dr. Eastman \u2019 s later memos closely track its analysis and proposal , \u201d Carter wrote .\nAs for the remaining 10 documents , the judge found that they would remain privileged and out of the committee \u2019 s hands .\nHe wrote that nine of them were related to the legal efforts in court to contest election results , and that while they may have featured some of the baseless voter fraud claims , pursuing challenges in court wasn \u2019 t part of the alleged criminal scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an email sent by someone after Congress had resumed certifying the election results on the night of Jan. 6 , so the judge held it couldn \u2019 t be considered part of any ongoing criminal effort at that point to convince Pence to reject certification .",

Brown , director of the National Center on Sleep Disorder Research .\nHowever , being alert is not the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sleeping that way , it does n't protect your heart , your pancreas , your digestion , \u201d Brown said .\n\u201c Good sleep is required for those things to function properly.\n\u201d Sleep leads to better learning and memory Learning and memory consist of three basic functions : acquisition ( introducing new information to the brain ) , consolidation ( stabilizing a memory ) , and recall ( accessing the information later ) .\nAcquisition and recall happen when we \u2019 re awake , but consolidation \u2014 a key part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we sleep .\nWhen you have a new experience , your conscious memory of that experience at first relies entirely on information stored in both the hippocampus and the neocortex .\nThe term memory consolidation refers to a process in which these fresh , malleable memories in the hippocampus are converted to more stable , long-lasting memories that can reside elsewhere in the brain .\nMemory consolidation can unfold for weeks to years after the information was initially acquired , and research suggests sleep is a particularly important time for consolidating memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn from them , researchers think it also plays an important role in helping us find creative solutions to problems we encounter while awake .\nArmed with whatever we learned from our memories as we slept , we often seem to solve problems \u2014 especially difficult problems \u2014 more easily when well rested .\nResearch has shown that sleep can boost problem-solving , and slow-wave sleep might be especially important .\nA study published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience in 2021 , for example , found that people who had a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem-solving task were much likelier to later solve the problem when tested than people who had received the same training ( and who had waited the same amount of time to be tested ) but did not sleep in between .\nThe researchers reported that 62 % of the sleep group solved the problem , compared with 24 % of the awake group , and subjects in the sleep group who had gotten more slow-wave sleep also had a higher chance of solving the problem .\nSleep is a key time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called cytokines as well as T-cells while we \u2019 re asleep .\nAccording to a 2021 review article published in Communications Biology , sleep deprivation is associated with a chronic inflammatory state as well as increased risk for both infectious and inflammatory disease .\nGetting enough sleep , on the other hand , can boost your immune system \u2019 s ability to protect you from getting sick .\nWhen people got enough sleep after receiving an experimental hepatitis A vaccine , for example , their immune systems produced more germ-fighting T helper cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the journal Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv European Journal of Physiology .\nWe need sleep to help our bodies recover and adapt after physical exercise , but there is evidence from research that sleep supports our athletic endeavors in other ways , too .\nSleep duration and improved sleep quality are both associated with improved performance and competitive success of athletes , according to a 2017 study published in Current Sports Medicine Reports , and they may also help reduce athletes \u2019 risk of injury or illness , both by boosting their immune systems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOther research supports this , such as a 2021 study published in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living , which found that athletes who get at least eight hours of sleep , or who had higher levels of sleep quality , were less likely to suffer from illness or injury .\nAnd aside from just getting hurt less , research has found many athletes enjoy better performance following sleep improvements .\nThat includes better reaction times , according to a 2019 study published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swim turns , kick stroke efficiency , and accuracy with both free throws and 3-point shots in basketball .\nHow sleep deprivation may affect your body Like mental health in general , anxiety has a bidirectional relationship with sleep , said Jonathan Jun , a pulmonary , critical care , and sleep medicine physician as well as assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine .\nJun pointed to research by the late William C. Dement , a renowned sleep researcher who found that if you interrupt people while they \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious the next day .\nSince then , more studies have also found that totally depriving people of sleep for short periods can make them more anxious , Jun added , although it may depend at least partly on the duration and severity of sleep deprivation .\n\u201c Acute , really severe deprivation of sleep is going to make you more anxious , but it \u2019 s not clear that just being a short sleeper , like chronically not sleeping as long , is going to have the same effect , \u201d Jun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive functioning if you are n't getting enough sleep .\nLosing even a few hours of sleep can wreak havoc with a wide variety of cognitive processes such as attention , language , reasoning , decision making , learning , and memory .\nResearch shows that even a single night of mild sleep restriction can hinder your vigilance , for example , as reflected in subjects \u2019 reduced processing capacity for decision making .\n\u201c When you do n't get enough sleep , one of the first things to happen is you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start to lose your attention span , and you ca n't react as quickly to things coming your way , \u201d Jun said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a part of your brain that filters what \u2019 s coming in and decides what 's important , and your ability to do that gets compromised.\n\u201d Sleep deprivation tends to sap your cognitive abilities fairly quickly , but it can also sneakily disrupt your coordination .\nThe effects on coordination may be less severe than the cognitive effects , Mitler said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly because they 're often so hard to notice in yourself .\n`` Frequently the impairment process can reach dangerous levels before the subject is aware of the adverse effects , '' he said .\nReaction time is also delayed .\n\u201c It is not an overwhelming difference , fractions of a second usually , \u201d Mitler said .\nHowever , that \u2019 s enough to affect your ability to drive a car or truck or pilot a ship at sea .\nStudies have shown that staying awake for 24 hours is similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 0.10 % percent , Jun said , which is over the legal limit for driving while impaired .\nMost of the time sleep-deprived people are not aware of their altered performance ; they think they are doing just fine , Jun said .\nEven in studies where people are told to sleep six hours a night for two weeks , it \u2019 s the equivalent of being awake for two nights straight .\n\u201c If you ask people if they 're falling asleep at the wheel they \u2019 ll say no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're not going to be able to react in time to what 's happening , \u201d Jun said .\n\u201c Even before they fall asleep , they 're already impaired.\n\u201d Lack of sleep is linked to heart disease and diabetes risk Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and in the United States , and there \u2019 s evidence that inadequate sleep does result in heightened risk for heart disease , according to a research review published in Sleep Medicine Clinics .\nMore research is still needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might contribute to heart disease , but there are clues about how it might work .\nSome research suggests sleep loss can lead to changes in particular hormones , for example , which trigger the chronic inflammation that sets the stage for atherosclerosis .\nThere is also evidence to suggest inadequate sleep is related to a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes , the most common form of the disease , according to a 2017 research review published in Current Diabetes Reports .\nOther analyses have reached similar conclusions , including a 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sleep disorders like insomnia , sleep apnea , and restless legs syndrome are linked to the development of Type 2 diabetes , and diabetes complications .\nLack of sleep is linked to hormonal changes and inflammation as well as increased food intake and impaired decision making .\nMany of these are also risk factors for obesity , which is itself a risk factor for diabetes .\nSleep deprivation can lead to changes in certain hormones , Jun said , including leptin and ghrelin , which are involved with hunger .\nLoss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hormone that tells us we \u2019 re full , and increases of ghrelin , a hormone that tells us we need to eat .\n\u201c So if you do n't sleep , and your leptin levels are low and your ghrelin levels are high , you are going to wake up hungry , \u201d he said .\nAlong with other hormonal changes , this might cause sleep-deprived people to overeat , resulting in weight gain .\n\u201c I think we as a society should destigmatize sleep , \u201d Jun said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a badge of honor that you do n't sleep long , you do n't need to sleep , sleep is for the weak , that kind of thing .\nI think that 's No .\n1 , do n't stigmatize sleep , recognize it 's important to get enough of it .\n\u201d",

hopeless , and defeated about it .\nBuzzFeed News asked readers to tell us how they feel about the vaccine delay and received over 1,000 responses from parents , teachers , and other people who interact with and take care of children .\nWhile we may be only weeks away from a safe and effective vaccine for kids under 5 , many people have felt lost and isolated in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Anne , mom of a 2-year-old .\n\u201c We feel like we are screaming into the void , \u201d said Lauren , mother to an 11-month-old .\n\u201c I feel like the kid who 's excited to hold a bunch of balloons and then watches them pop one by one because of circumstances beyond their control , \u201d said Sabrina , mom of a 3-year-old and a 3-month-old .\nThe FDA was originally expected to authorize the Pfizer COVID vaccine for children 6 months to 4 years old in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government agency indefinitely postponed a meeting , leaving anxious caregivers in the dark .\n\u201c Maybe if we had been told that it could be a long , tiring course , if we had been warned that we would likely see many surges and lulls , maybe then people would be a little more resilient and not so fatigued , \u201d said Carrie Knight , mom of three in Virginia , including a 1-year-old .\n\u201c We were \u2018 all in it together \u2019 in March 2020 .\nBut March 2022 ?\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now.\n\u201d Clinical trials suggested that two doses of a 3-microgram vaccine , which is one-third the adult dose , was safe and effective for babies ages 6 months to one year .\nHowever , in kids ages 2 to 4 , that dosage of the vaccine didn \u2019 t offer enough protection , although it was shown to be safe .\nAt the moment , Pfizer is reviewing the efficacy of a third dose of the vaccine , which is given two months after the second dose .\nAdding a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection and \u201c maximize the risk-benefit profile , \u201d a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News .\nThe company said this data should be ready by early April , which could mean vaccines will be available for kids under 5 around that time .\n( The Pfizer vaccine is already available for kids ages 5 and up . )\nThis week Moderna released its data on vaccines for children under 6 and expects to ask the FDA for authorization \u201c in the coming weeks , \u201d the company said .\nThe vaccine , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult dose , was 43.7 % effective against coronavirus infection primarily caused by the Omicron variant in kids 6 months to 2 years old and 37.5 % effective in those 2 to 5 years old .\n( The Moderna vaccine is currently only available for adults and is about 94 % effective in those who get two doses . )\nMany people acknowledge that the delay means there \u2019 s a better chance the shots will actually protect young children \u2014 most of whom can \u2019 t wear masks because they aren \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but caregivers also feel forced to depend on others for their child \u2019 s safety , especially those with immunocompromised children .\n\u201c I keep dreaming that it does happen : that [ vaccine ] approval comes , that my child is vaccinated , \u201d said Kelly , 36 , mother to a 1-year-old in Colorado who prefers her last name to stay private .\n\u201c I always wake up so desperate .\nI cry a lot during showers.\n\u201d News of the Pfizer delay came as the deadly Omicron surge was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s now under 1,000 per day ) .\nMore recently , states , schools , and daycares have announced they are no longer requiring people to wear masks indoors .\nCOVID can be a serious risk to children There \u2019 s a common misperception that COVID isn \u2019 t that serious for kids , usually because adults are often much more likely to get sick , be hospitalized , and die from the disease , particularly if they aren \u2019 t vaccinated .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean coronavirus infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A CDC report published March 15 found that children ages 0 to 4 were hospitalized with COVID at a rate five times higher during the Omicron surge compared with that of the Delta variant last year .\nAs of March 24 , 418 children under 5 have died of COVID .\nAbout 20 % of all deaths in children under 18 occurred during Omicron 's dominance .\nThe caregivers we talked to are also concerned about the unknown long-term consequences of infection , including long COVID ; MIS-C ( multisystem inflammatory syndrome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers inflammation in different body parts such as the heart , kidneys , brain , or eyes ; and diabetes .\n( Coronavirus infections seem to raise children \u2019 s risk of the autoimmune condition , Type 1 diabetes , and possibly Type 2 diabetes as well . )\n\u201c I do n't think it 's fair to leave her defenseless against a virus while everyone else gets to have the option to be vaccinated against it , \u201d said Sharon Cook , a 35-year-old mom of a 3-year-old in Maryland .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's health just because some people think children are going to have an easier time with COVID .\nIt 's nobody 's right to roll the dice on my child 's health.\n\u201d As caregivers wait for the FDA to review Pfizer and Moderna \u2019 s data , they \u2019 re especially vigilant of a seemingly more contagious subvariant of Omicron , called BA.2 , that \u2019 s sending coronavirus case trends in the wrong direction in Western Europe .\nIt \u2019 s also spreading steadily in the US , making up about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week ending March 19 .\nWhile feelings are mixed , the delay is a major source of stress for many caregivers who feel the government \u2019 s push to prepandemic normalcy isn \u2019 t considering the approximately 18 million children who fall in this age group .\nPeople of all ages with weakened immune systems are more likely to be hospitalized , need intensive care , require a ventilator , and/or die from COVID , which is why caregivers of immunocompromised babies and toddlers feel even more overlooked and isolated than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLindsay King , who has a 4-year-old daughter , said she was \u201c elated \u201d when the FDA set a review date for the Pfizer COVID vaccine for kids under 5 , but the postponement \u201c felt like the rug was pulled out from under me , \u201d she told us .\n\u201c We special needs parents have been waiting for this a really , really long time.\n\u201d King \u2019 s daughter was diagnosed with autism , \u201c which makes her especially prone to infection due to decreased impulse control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her daughter also has complex Chiari malformation \u2014 a condition that causes the cerebellum , the part of the brain responsible for balance and other motor functions , to push into the spinal cord \u2014 and a tethered spine , which causes chronic constipation and frequent falls .\nThe 36-year-old from Texas said her daughter leaves the house only for doctor appointments and behavioral therapy , so the delay means \u201c many more months of worrying , sleeplessness , ongoing isolation , and emotional deprivation .\n\u201c I feel scared , frustrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\nSome caregivers have had to make the difficult decision to keep their immunocompromised kids from school or other interactions that are necessary for healthy development .\nRachel Hansen of Oregon said her 2-year-old has Down syndrome and a severe heart defect that required two open-heart surgeries that have kept her isolated since birth .\n\u201c Everything in my life is governed by how much it puts my toddler at risk of being around others and potentially getting sick , \u201d Hansen , 26 , said .\n\u201c Once she can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start living life , whereas right now we are stuck in a weird waiting period.\n\u201d In the meantime , Hansen said she will avoid family and continue Zoom playdates and virtual therapy \u2014 a lack of social interaction that has already caused a developmental delay in her daughter \u2019 s ability to interact with others her age , she said .\nFor other caregivers of immunocompromised children , childcare has been one of the biggest challenges , aside from dodging COVID .\nClaire has a 1-year-old with cystic fibrosis , a genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lungs and digestive tract .\nShe told us her son caught a cold at the end of 2021 that took her and her husband away from work often , and stripped her of their nanny who , understandably , didn \u2019 t want to care for a sick child .\n\u201c We had to up his chest physical therapy from 20 minutes , twice a day , to four to fives times per day , \u201d which for a toddler \u201c was like wrestling an alligator , \u201d she said .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was miserable and having trouble breathing .\nI \u2019 m terrified of him catching COVID for fear that his little lungs couldn \u2019 t handle it.\n\u201d For Claire , a COVID vaccine means she would feel free from constant worry , be able to take her son to see extended family for the first time , and send her son to daycare , which is less expensive than the nanny she hired , allowing her baby to socialize more with other kids his age .\n\u201c I really wish we could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID , \u201d Claire said .\n\u201c The health and safety of my son and so many others depend on it.\n\u201d People who work with kids are struggling too Abby , a children \u2019 s librarian in Wisconsin who asked that her last name be kept private , said she does seven or more storytimes a week for kids under 5 at a library with no mask mandate .\nWithin that time , she \u2019 ll see about 100 kids and their caregivers .\n\u201c This means myself and my staff are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , singing and reading to them in an enclosed space , \u201d Abby said .\n\u201c At a certain point , it just feels like we 're saying that as a society , we 're cool with sacrificing vulnerable kids ( and grownups with immune system deficiencies and disorders ) for the sake of saying we 're winning the fight against COVID like it 's some kind of contest , \u201d Abby , 38 , told us .\n\u201c We 've already lost .\nWe 've lost so many lives and for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathy and humanity.\n\u201d Many teachers feel the same .\nJT Handley , a 23-year-old preschool teacher in Missouri , said they are \u201c stressed and anxious , both for the health and safety of my students and for my current financial situation.\n\u201d Earlier in the year , Handley tested positive for COVID with a mild case and had to miss work for almost an entire pay period ( staff at their school has to take a minimum of five days off with no pay if in direct contact with an infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to average 70 hours per pay period , \u201d said Handley .\n\u201c I earned seven for the period I had COVID.\n\u201d Some people , like J. Lauren Armshaw , 31 , a professional nanny in Louisiana , have had to cut ties with people in their personal lives to protect their professional ones .\nArmshaw said she stopped talking to some people who don \u2019 t share her views on COVID vaccines , in part to protect those she nannies for .\n\u201c The toddlers and babies in my care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t imagine one of them getting COVID and getting very ill , \u201d she said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s scary living in a world where we just don \u2019 t know and people don \u2019 t care.\n\u201d The caregivers who already had COVID For the families lucky enough to have avoided COVID so far , vaccines offer an extra layer of protection against infection , although there \u2019 s no guarantee of that .\nBut for many others who have already tested positive , the shots are what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumatic COVID experience .\nKeith Lieder , 37 , of Michigan , contracted COVID in April 2020 .\nNearly two months later , Lieder lost 30 pounds after weeks of debilitating symptoms that kept him isolated from his two daughters , then 3 years and 6 months old , who were too young to be tested at the time .\nFor two years now , Lieder has had long COVID , experiencing numbness on the right side of his body , sore throat , headaches , nerve pain , and dizziness , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a horrible , horrible struggle mentally and physically .\nI used to be in great shape with no health problems and now every day is a struggle .\nIt breaks my heart to even think about my children or anyone \u2019 s children having to deal with even a fraction of what I and my family have had to go through , \u201d said Lieder , adding that he feels helpless , anxious , and frustrated over the foggy timeline for COVID vaccination for his daughters .\n\u201c And for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children vaccinated as soon as we know it is safe to do so.\n\u201d Whether triggered by the delay or not , some caregivers remain hesitant to vaccinate their kids while others are certain they won \u2019 t .\n\u201c We plan on vaccinating our baby , though we \u2019 d prefer not to be in the \u2018 first wave \u2019 when emergency use is approved , \u201d said Kim V. , 34 , mother to a 7-month-old in Ohio .\n\u201c Vaccinating my child feels different than making the choice to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others are on the fence .\n\u201c Half of me says yes because he does n't know a world without COVID and protocols .\nThe other half of me says no because he is so young and if he had an adverse reaction it would kill me , \u201d said Ali Morin , 28 , mom to a 2-year-old .\nMeanwhile , many caregivers say they are not anti-vaccine , but anti\u2013COVID vaccine , sharing that they feel the coronavirus shots were developed too quickly or that they feel the risks for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pediatric hospitalist at the University of Texas \u2019 s Dell Children \u2019 s Medical Center and professor at the Dell Medical School , said she worries the delay is \u201c giving people pause , \u201d but that \u201c this is truly what transparency and science looks like.\n\u201d \u201c It \u2019 s disappointing as a pediatrician and parent of two kids that fall in this age range , but I think that the delay to me is evidence of the rigor and safety of the overall process , \u201d Gambill said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to be frustrated , but this reassures me that when the vaccine is available it will , without a doubt , work and be safe .\n\u201d",

Brown , director of the National Center on Sleep Disorder Research .\nHowever , being alert is not the same thing as being healthy .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't protect your heart , your pancreas , your digestion , \u201d Brown said .\n\u201c Good sleep is required for those things to function properly.\n\u201d Sleep leads to better learning and memory Learning and memory consist of three basic functions : acquisition ( introducing new information to the brain ) , consolidation ( stabilizing a memory ) , and recall ( accessing the information later ) .\nAcquisition and recall happen when we \u2019 re awake , but consolidation \u2014 a key part of learning and memory \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you have a new experience , your conscious memory of that experience at first relies entirely on information stored in both the hippocampus and the neocortex .\nThe term memory consolidation refers to a process in which these fresh , malleable memories in the hippocampus are converted to more stable , long-lasting memories that can reside elsewhere in the brain .\nMemory consolidation can unfold for weeks to years after the information was initially acquired , and research suggests sleep is a particularly important time for consolidating memories .\nBecause sleep helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , researchers think it also plays an important role in helping us find creative solutions to problems we encounter while awake .\nArmed with whatever we learned from our memories as we slept , we often seem to solve problems \u2014 especially difficult problems \u2014 more easily when well rested .\nResearch has shown that sleep can boost problem-solving , and slow-wave sleep might be especially important .\nA study published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience in 2021 , for example , found that people who had a night of sleep after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelier to later solve the problem when tested than people who had received the same training ( and who had waited the same amount of time to be tested ) but did not sleep in between .\nThe researchers reported that 62 % of the sleep group solved the problem , compared with 24 % of the awake group , and subjects in the sleep group who had gotten more slow-wave sleep also had a higher chance of solving the problem .\nSleep is a key time for the immune system , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as T-cells while we \u2019 re asleep .\nAccording to a 2021 review article published in Communications Biology , sleep deprivation is associated with a chronic inflammatory state as well as increased risk for both infectious and inflammatory diseases .\nGetting enough sleep , on the other hand , can boost your immune system \u2019 s ability to protect you from getting sick .\nWhen people got enough sleep after receiving an experimental hepatitis A vaccine , for example , their immune systems produced more germ-fighting T helper cells and antibodies , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archiv European Journal of Physiology .\nWe need sleep to help our bodies recover and adapt after physical exercise , but there is evidence from research that sleep supports our athletic endeavors in other ways , too .\nSleep duration and improved sleep quality are both associated with improved performance and competitive success of athletes , according to a 2017 study published in Current Sports Medicine Reports , and they may also help reduce athletes \u2019 risk of injury or illness , both by boosting their immune systems and by helping increase their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , such as a 2021 study published in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living , which found that athletes who get at least eight hours of sleep , or who had higher levels of sleep quality , were less likely to suffer from illness or injury .\nAnd aside from just getting hurt less , research has found many athletes enjoy better performance following sleep improvements .\nThat includes better reaction times , according to a 2019 study published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine , along with sprint times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick stroke efficiency , and accuracy with both free throws and 3-point shots in basketball .\nHow sleep deprivation may affect your body Like mental health in general , anxiety has a bidirectional relationship with sleep , said Jonathan Jun , a pulmonary , critical care , and sleep medicine physician as well as assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine .\nJun pointed to research by the late William C. Dement , a renowned sleep researcher who found that if you interrupt people while they \u2019 re dreaming , they wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSince then , more studies have also found that totally depriving people of sleep for short periods can make them more anxious , Jun added , although it may depend at least partly on the duration and severity of sleep deprivation .\n\u201c Acute , really severe deprivation of sleep is going to make you more anxious , but it \u2019 s not clear that just being a short sleeper , like chronically not sleeping as long , is going to have the same effect , \u201d Jun said .\nDo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't getting enough sleep .\nLosing even a few hours of sleep can wreak havoc with a wide variety of cognitive processes such as attention , language , reasoning , decision-making , learning , and memory .\nResearch shows that even a single night of mild sleep restriction can hinder your vigilance , for example , as reflected in subjects \u2019 reduced processing capacity for decision making .\n\u201c When you do n't get enough sleep , one of the first things to happen is you start to not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention span , and you ca n't react as quickly to things coming your way , \u201d Jun said .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a part of your brain that filters what \u2019 s coming in and decides what 's important , and your ability to do that gets compromised.\n\u201d Sleep deprivation tends to sap your cognitive abilities fairly quickly , but it can also sneakily disrupt your coordination .\nThe effects on coordination may be less severe than the cognitive effects , Mitler said , but they can still cause big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard to notice in yourself .\n`` Frequently the impairment process can reach dangerous levels before the subject is aware of the adverse effects , '' he said .\nReaction time is also delayed .\n\u201c It is not an overwhelming difference , fractions of a second usually , \u201d Mitler said .\nHowever , that \u2019 s enough to affect your ability to drive a car or truck or pilot a ship at sea .\nStudies have shown that staying awake for 24 hours is similar to having a blood alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jun said , which is over the legal limit for driving while impaired .\nMost of the time sleep-deprived people are not aware of their altered performance ; they think they are doing just fine , Jun said .\nEven in studies where people are told to sleep six hours a night for two weeks , it \u2019 s the equivalent of being awake for two nights straight .\n\u201c If you ask people if they 're falling asleep at the wheel they \u2019 ll say no , but their reaction time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to react in time to what 's happening , \u201d Jun said .\n\u201c Even before they fall asleep , they 're already impaired.\n\u201d Lack of sleep is linked to heart disease and diabetes risk Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and in the United States , and there \u2019 s evidence that inadequate sleep does result in heightened risk for heart disease , according to a research review published in Sleep Medicine Clinics .\nMore research is still needed to shed light on how exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are clues about how it might work .\nSome research suggests sleep loss can lead to changes in particular hormones , for example , which trigger the chronic inflammation that sets the stage for atherosclerosis .\nThere is also evidence to suggest inadequate sleep is related to a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes , the most common form of the disease , according to a 2017 research review published in Current Diabetes Reports .\nOther analyses have reached similar conclusions , including a 2021 literature review in Diabetologia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleep apnea , and restless legs syndrome are linked to the development of Type 2 diabetes , and diabetes complications .\nLack of sleep is linked to hormonal changes and inflammation as well as increased food intake and impaired decision making .\nMany of these are also risk factors for obesity , which is itself a risk factor for diabetes .\nSleep deprivation can lead to changes in certain hormones , Jun said , including leptin and ghrelin , which are involved with hunger .\nLoss of sleep is associated with decreases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us we \u2019 re full , and increases of ghrelin , a hormone that tells us we need to eat .\n\u201c So if you do n't sleep , and your leptin levels are low and your ghrelin levels are high , you are going to wake up hungry , \u201d he said .\nAlong with other hormonal changes , this might cause sleep-deprived people to overeat , resulting in weight gain .\n\u201c I think we as a society should destigmatize sleep , \u201d Jun said .\n\u201c It 's kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't sleep long , you do n't need to sleep , sleep is for the weak , that kind of thing .\nI think that 's number one : Do n't stigmatize sleep .\nRecognize it 's important to get enough of it .\n\u201d",

        "title": "Here\u2019s My Review Of Pillow Cube, Which Is Supposed To Work For Side Sleepers",
        "content": "My first impression upon receiving my Pillow Cubes was that I \u2019 d been sent a package directly from Saved by the Bell , since it had a distinct early \u2018 90s vibe .\nI liked the quirky , retro branding and watching them expand from relatively flat squares to voluminous and firm cubes .\nIt was an enjoyable unboxing experience all around .\nThen came bedtime , which was a little less enjoyable .\nI decided to try the Classic Ice Cube version first .\n( The company provided this cooling version , and the original cube pillow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at no cost . )\nThe shape and firmness were relatively identical to the original , with the addition of a cooling effect .\nIt was one of those bizarrely warm New York days in early March where I resist turning on my air conditioner because I know it \u2019 s going to be frigid again in no time , but still need a bit of cooling power .\nWhile it did feel cold to the touch with just the cover on , it didn \u2019 t necessarily feel any cooler against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillowcase .\n( I think a pillowcase should come with the OG Sidekick since it won \u2019 t fit into any standard case , but you do have to purchase them separately . )\nIt took some adjusting to find a comfortable position with the cube .\nMy bottom arm felt like it was in the way , and I didn \u2019 t know where to put it .\nI fell asleep fairly quickly after I stopped fidgeting with said arm but woke up a few hours later when I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cube once again .\nIn my partially awake state , I lost sight of my journalistic goals and tossed the cube aside in favor of my usual plush rectangular pillow .\nA similar sequence of events occurred throughout the next two nights .\nI am unfortunately a creature of habit .\nSome other things I noticed in my Pillow Cube journey that may be helpful to others : My head was angled slightly up , meaning that the standard height was likely too high for the width of my shoulders .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me any significant neck strain .\nWhen I went to switch sides , I felt like my head might fall off the pillow since there isn \u2019 t much length to work with , which could be pertinent since most people don \u2019 t wake up in the exact position that they fall asleep in .\nAfter testing out the original cube pillow and the cooling version , I went back to Pillow Cube \u2019 s website to dig a little deeper ( probably something I should have done more before selecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiz that you can take to determine the right size pillow for you .\nIt was not surprising that the standard cubed Sidekick was not the best choice for me .\nI 'm a stomach sleeper hoping to train myself to be a side sleeper , and I frequently toss and turn in my sleep .\nInstead , they suggested the Side Sleeper Pro , which measures 12 by 24 inches ( clearly rectangular ) in the 4-inch depth , the thinnest size .\nWhen I clicked on the Side Sleeper Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the larger Side Sleeper Cube is actually the ideal pillow for beds while the Sidekick ( actual cube ) is best for couch naps and travel .\nThis was a bit confusing since the Sidekick is the attention-grabbing product that 's plastered across all of the advertisements , so my PSA is that it \u2019 s not the best option if you \u2019 re looking for a primary bed pillow .\nMy results also mean that the name of the company and the sizing guide are a bit counterintuitive .\nHaving \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the products are all indeed square-shaped , and my quiz told me that I should opt for the thin size ( 4 inches thick ) while the standard size ( 5 inches thick ) is actually what correlates to my height ( they give a range of 5 \u2019 4 \u201d to 6 \u2019 3 \u201d and I am 5 \u2019 6 \u201d ) .\nIn conclusion , after my testing and additional exploration , I can see the utility of the Pillow Cube but highly suggest doing your research and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t get the standard Sidekick just because it \u2019 s your strongest visual association .\nThe Side Sleeper Pro is actually better if you plan to use it as your primary pillow , and no matter your height , the thin size may be best for those restless stomach and back sleepers hoping to transition into side sleeping .\nHowever , if you know you have broad shoulders , the standard or thick could still be the most comfortable angle for those worried about neck pain .\nAs someone with frequent digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck pain , I am determined to train myself to be a side sleeper as opposed to flopping onto my stomach with one arm under a squishy pillow for extra support .\nMy arm often falls asleep causing me to wake up and shake out the tingly sensation every few hours .\nI believe that the Side Sleeper Pro could be an effective tool for that training , and also likely beneficial for spine and neck alignment for any consistent side sleepers .\nI would only recommend the Sidekick to 100 % side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or travel , as is suggested by Pillow Cube ( granted , mostly in the fine print ) .\nYou can buy the Sidekick from Pillow Cube for around $ 70 .\nYou can buy the Classic Ice Cube from Pillow Cube for around $ 160 .\nYou can buy the Side Sleeper Pro from Pillow Cube for around $ 130 .",

        "content": "Boosters are back .\nAgain .\nThis week the FDA and CDC recommended a second booster dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines for people 50 and over and anyone who \u2019 s immunocompromised \u2014 for example , due to an organ transplant , conditions like cancer , or other reasons \u2014 if they are 12 or older .\nIf it \u2019 s been at least four months since you got your first booster shot , and you meet the criteria , you should probably get one , experts say .\n( Children under 12 aren \u2019 t eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 still can \u2019 t get their first shots . )\nStill , we know what you \u2019 re thinking : Seriously ?\nAnother shot ?\nSo BuzzFeed News spoke with several experts to better understand how booster protection changes over time and whether you really need that extra jab .\n\u201c I know everybody wants great news , that we can be done with COVID and everything 's going to be fine , but that 's not really true .\nThere are a lot of things we do n't know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times when people still have to take precautions , \u201d said Dr. Emily Landon , an infectious disease expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine .\n\u201c It 's not a higher-risk time for people in most parts of the country right now , but that does n't mean that there wo n't ever be another high-risk time.\n\u201d The good news is that evidence shows boosters work .\nPeople who got the first booster in addition to the two-shot vaccine were 12 times less likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely to require the use of a ventilator or die than the unvaccinated , according to two CDC reports .\nThose with boosters were three times less likely to be hospitalized than those with just two doses of the vaccines .\nHow long after a COVID booster are you immune ?\nThis is not a simple question to answer for a few reasons : Not enough time has passed since the first group of people got boosted , protection isn \u2019 t always easy to measure , and the response can vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s still a lot we don \u2019 t know about the virus , particularly when new variants pop up .\nBut there is some early evidence that hints at what \u2019 s going on .\nProtection against mild COVID increases to about 65 % to 70 % following a booster dose but drops to 45 % to 50 % after about two months , according to a report from the UK released in January .\nProtection against severe COVID lasts much longer .\nAfter a booster , protection against hospitalization stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83 % two months later .\nAt four months , protection against hospitalization is 78 % , according to a 10-state analysis released by the CDC in February .\nOf the more than 240,000 people in the study who visited an emergency room or urgent care for COVID , 46 % were unvaccinated , 44 % had two doses , and 10 % had two doses plus a booster .\nWhile there \u2019 s much we don \u2019 t know , it \u2019 s clear that vaccine protection wanes over time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies \u2014 can help .\nHowever , booster protection doesn \u2019 t last forever , dwindling a bit each month .\n\u201c We need to think of these as vaccines offering shorter-term protection than what a measles vaccine would do , for example , especially with more variants around , \u201d Landon told BuzzFeed News .\nThe dominant version of the coronavirus in the US is a subvariant of Omicron called Omicron BA.2 , which appears to be more contagious but not more severe , than other types of the virus .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all infections as of March 26 .\nMeanwhile , infections in some regions , including parts of the Northeast , are rising as mask mandates and indoor vaccine requirements come to an end in many cities and states .\n\u201c All of us are probably going to need to update our protection at some point , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c If protection is wearing off in older people , it 's going to wear off in younger people eventually.\n\u201d Like all vaccines , there \u2019 s no such thing as 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful if they prevent hospitalizations and death , so you could still get COVID \u2014 it may just be milder .\nWhy does overall protection from COVID boosters wane over time ?\nUnderstanding why protection diminishes over time may help give you an incentive to roll up your sleeve a third , fourth , or fifth time ( depending on what COVID vaccine you received first and whether you \u2019 re immunocompromised ) .\nVaccines generate two different kinds of immunity , Landon noted : short term , which mostly protects you against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and long term , which works to keep you safe if infected again months or years later .\nThe first line of defense is made up of protective proteins called antibodies that block the coronavirus from infecting your cells .\nThese can keep you from getting sick in the first place , but as is the case for other respiratory viruses , they may not provide long-lasting protection , Landon said .\nThis can explain why you can catch COVID , the flu , or the common cold again months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defense involves other parts of the immune system , including memory B cells .\nSome B cells produce antibodies that fight infection early on , albeit for a relatively short period of time , while others will become memory B cells that help your body recognize the virus ( introduced either via vaccination or infection ) months , even years , later and trigger an appropriate immune response , said Theodora Hatziioannou , a research associate professor at Rockefeller University in New York .\nMemory B cells don \u2019 t play too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you encounter a germ because it takes a while for these cells to become activated and start making antibodies , Hatziioannou said .\nThey do \u201c wake up \u201d in time to protect you from serious symptoms if you confront a germ again , though .\nHatziioannou and her colleagues posted a non-peer-reviewed study on Feb. 15 that found a booster dose not only increases the stockpile of memory B cells created by a second shot but also encourages the production of new ones that are all around more powerful and better at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells that contribute to this memory immune response , according to Alba Grifoni , an instructor and researcher at the Sette Lab at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California .\nThese cells can recognize and kill the virus , limiting its spread in the body .\nThey also recognize several parts of the virus , not just the spike protein it uses to enter cells , so they \u2019 re particularly good at detecting different variants .\nThe bad news , however , is that this immune memory is \u201c running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in older and immunocompromised people , according to Landon , because naturally , immune systems don \u2019 t function at their peak in these groups .\nWhile many older adults feel like they 're in tip-top shape , they are often at a disadvantage when it comes to fighting off COVID and other infections in terms of immune function .\n\u201c Modern medicine has been allowing individuals with what would have been really debilitating medical conditions to live perfectly normal lives , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c It does accumulate a toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to mitigate many of the effects of that , we 're not really able to stop it from affecting your immunity.\n\u201d Younger people in good health tend to have stronger long-term immunological memory compared with older people , Landon said .\nDo younger , healthy people need a second booster ?\nBoosters are not yet recommended for healthy people under 50 , but that could change , particularly if a new , more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variant starts to circulate .\nWhile data are limited , scientists know the more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to mutate into a potentially more infectious or deadly version of itself \u2014 and this is why both Hatziioannou and Landon agree it might make sense to boost young , healthy people a second time .\n\u201c What I 'm concerned about is what the virus is going to become , \u201d said Hatziioannou , who added that one booster \u201c is a must , \u201d but that she isn \u2019 t convinced a second is needed in this group at this time .\n\u201c Is there a chance for a variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further ?\n\u201d Vaccinated people are less likely to spread the virus to others ( though it \u2019 s still possible ) so Landon said double-boosting this population now may help prevent another surge in COVID cases .\n\u201c We need to be led a little bit by the precautionary principle , \u201d she said .\nThis is why the FDA and CDC went ahead and authorized additional boosters without a ton of evidence suggesting the need to do so , Landon added .\nSome of the only evidence available on second boosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jab was authorized in early January for high-risk people \u2014 among adults aged 60 and older .\nA non-peer-reviewed study found that 0.1 % of people who got one booster died over the study \u2019 s 40-day period compared with 0.03 % of those who got two boosters .\nHow safe is it to participate in public activities months after receiving a booster ?\nAs mask mandates and other preventive measures disappear in many cities and states , and as your booster protection wanes , you may be wondering how safe it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors with others .\nTo be clear , what \u2019 s safe for you may not be safe for others .\nSo deciding how to reenter or continue navigating public life is highly dependent on your own risks , as well as how prevalent COVID is in your community , said Landon , who thinks now is a more appropriate time to live mask-free given low caseloads across the US .\n( The CDC offers a COVID tracker by county so you can check your local area . )\n\u201c There are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wearing masks in some situations , \u201d she said , but if you feel your risks are low , then consider the three C \u2019 s : closed spaces with poor ventilation , crowded areas , and close contact .\nIn general , wear medical-grade masks like N95s , Landon said , especially if sharing a space with unmasked or otherwise vulnerable people .\nAnd remember : There are several people who don \u2019 t respond properly to COVID vaccines or who aren \u2019 t yet eligible for vaccination , like babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we kind of owe it to them to be as careful as possible , \u201d Hatziioannou said .\nIf you \u2019 re particularly worried about getting infected , you may be tempted to take an antibody test to measure your protection .\nBut Landon said commercially available tests can \u2019 t tell you whether you have enough neutralizing antibodies ( those that can actually prevent infection ) .\nCould we reach a point where extra COVID boosters can \u2019 t offer more protection ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s definitely possible that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landon said , \u201c like we vaxxed out.\n\u201d But the mechanism behind this possibility isn \u2019 t well known .\nGrifoni of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology said scientists are trying to understand if we \u2019 ll reach a COVID vaccine limit , or if this virus will require annual shots like the flu .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very hard to say , \u201d she said , but we do already know that for other viruses , three doses seem to be the magic number for triggering a long-term immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , and hepatitis B vaccines .\nIn the meantime , Omicron BA.2 is circulating .\nIt \u2019 s too early to tell if it \u2019 s going to cause another devastating wave of infections and hospitalizations like in Europe , but it \u2019 s possible , Landon said , particularly in regions with lower vaccination rates .\n\u201c I certainly think anyone who wants to be protected should [ get a second booster if eligible ] and that individuals who have n't had any vaccines are at the absolute highest risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no evidence that COVID is getting easier or less dangerous , especially for people who are unvaccinated .\n\u201d",

        "title": "How Long Do Boosters Last? Here\u2019s The Deal On Whether You Need Another One.",
        "content": "Boosters are back .\nAgain .\nThis week the FDA and CDC recommended a second booster dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines for people 50 and over and anyone who \u2019 s immunocompromised \u2014 for example , due to an organ transplant , conditions like cancer , or other reasons \u2014 if they are 12 or older .\nIf it \u2019 s been at least four months since you got your first booster shot , and you meet the criteria , you should probably get one , experts say .\n( Children under 12 aren \u2019 t eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 still can \u2019 t get their first shots . )\nStill , we know what you \u2019 re thinking : Seriously ?\nAnother shot ?\nSo BuzzFeed News spoke with several experts to better understand how booster protection changes over time and whether you really need that extra jab .\n\u201c I know everybody wants great news , that we can be done with COVID and everything 's going to be fine , but that 's not really true .\nThere are a lot of things we do n't know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times when people still have to take precautions , \u201d said Dr. Emily Landon , an infectious disease expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine .\n\u201c It 's not a higher-risk time for people in most parts of the country right now , but that does n't mean that there wo n't ever be another high-risk time.\n\u201d The good news is that evidence shows boosters work .\nPeople who got the first booster in addition to the two-shot vaccine were 12 times less likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely to require the use of a ventilator or die than the unvaccinated , according to two CDC reports .\nThose with boosters were three times less likely to be hospitalized than those with just two doses of the vaccines .\nHow long after a COVID booster are you immune ?\nThis is not a simple question to answer for a few reasons : Not enough time has passed since the first group of people got boosted , protection isn \u2019 t always easy to measure , and the response can vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there \u2019 s still a lot we don \u2019 t know about the virus , particularly when new variants pop up .\nBut there is some early evidence that hints at what \u2019 s going on .\nProtection against mild COVID increases to about 65 % to 70 % following a booster dose but drops to 45 % to 50 % after about two months , according to a report from the UK released in January .\nProtection against severe COVID lasts much longer .\nAfter a booster , protection against hospitalization stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83 % two months later .\nAt four months , protection against hospitalization is 78 % , according to a 10-state analysis released by the CDC in February .\nOf the more than 240,000 people in the study who visited an emergency room or urgent care for COVID , 46 % were unvaccinated , 44 % had two doses , and 10 % had two doses plus a booster .\nWhile there \u2019 s much we don \u2019 t know , it \u2019 s clear that vaccine protection wanes over time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies \u2014 can help .\nHowever , booster protection doesn \u2019 t last forever , dwindling a bit each month .\n\u201c We need to think of these as vaccines offering shorter-term protection than what a measles vaccine would do , for example , especially with more variants around , \u201d Landon told BuzzFeed News .\nThe dominant version of the coronavirus in the US is a subvariant of Omicron called Omicron BA.2 , which appears to be more contagious but not more severe , than other types of the virus .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all infections as of March 26 .\nMeanwhile , infections in some regions , including parts of the Northeast , are rising as mask mandates and indoor vaccine requirements come to an end in many cities and states .\n\u201c All of us are probably going to need to update our protection at some point , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c If protection is wearing off in older people , it 's going to wear off in younger people eventually.\n\u201d Like all vaccines , there \u2019 s no such thing as 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful if they prevent hospitalizations and death , so you could still get COVID \u2014 it may just be milder .\nWhy does overall protection from COVID boosters wane over time ?\nUnderstanding why protection diminishes over time may help give you an incentive to roll up your sleeve a third , fourth , or fifth time ( depending on what COVID vaccine you received first and whether you \u2019 re immunocompromised ) .\nVaccines generate two different kinds of immunity , Landon noted : short term , which mostly protects you against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and long term , which works to keep you safe if infected again months or years later .\nThe first line of defense is made up of protective proteins called antibodies that block the coronavirus from infecting your cells .\nThese can keep you from getting sick in the first place , but as is the case for other respiratory viruses , they may not provide long-lasting protection , Landon said .\nThis can explain why you can catch COVID , the flu , or the common cold again months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defense involves other parts of the immune system , including memory B cells .\nSome B cells produce antibodies that fight infection early on , albeit for a relatively short period of time , while others will become memory B cells that help your body recognize the virus ( introduced either via vaccination or infection ) months , even years , later and trigger an appropriate immune response , said Theodora Hatziioannou , a research associate professor at Rockefeller University in New York .\nMemory B cells don \u2019 t play too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you encounter a germ because it takes a while for these cells to become activated and start making antibodies , Hatziioannou said .\nThey do \u201c wake up \u201d in time to protect you from serious symptoms if you confront a germ again , though .\nHatziioannou and her colleagues posted a non-peer-reviewed study on Feb. 15 that found a booster dose not only increases the stockpile of memory B cells created by a second shot but also encourages the production of new ones that are all around more powerful and better at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells that contribute to this memory immune response , according to Alba Grifoni , an instructor and researcher at the Sette Lab at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California .\nThese cells can recognize and kill the virus , limiting its spread in the body .\nThey also recognize several parts of the virus , not just the spike protein it uses to enter cells , so they \u2019 re particularly good at detecting different variants .\nThe bad news , however , is that this immune memory is \u201c running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in older and immunocompromised people , according to Landon , because naturally , immune systems don \u2019 t function at their peak in these groups .\nWhile many older adults feel like they 're in tip-top shape , they are often at a disadvantage when it comes to fighting off COVID and other infections in terms of immune function .\n\u201c Modern medicine has been allowing individuals with what would have been really debilitating medical conditions to live perfectly normal lives , \u201d Landon said .\n\u201c It does accumulate a toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to mitigate many of the effects of that , we 're not really able to stop it from affecting your immunity.\n\u201d Younger people in good health tend to have stronger long-term immunological memory compared with older people , Landon said .\nDo younger , healthy people need a second booster ?\nBoosters are not yet recommended for healthy people under 50 , but that could change , particularly if a new , more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variant starts to circulate .\nWhile data are limited , scientists know the more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to mutate into a potentially more infectious or deadly version of itself \u2014 and this is why both Hatziioannou and Landon agree it might make sense to boost young , healthy people a second time .\n\u201c What I 'm concerned about is what the virus is going to become , \u201d said Hatziioannou , who added that one booster \u201c is a must , \u201d but that she isn \u2019 t convinced a second is needed in this group at this time .\n\u201c Is there a chance for a variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further ?\n\u201d Vaccinated people are less likely to spread the virus to others ( though it \u2019 s still possible ) so Landon said double-boosting this population now may help prevent another surge in COVID cases .\n\u201c We need to be led a little bit by the precautionary principle , \u201d she said .\nThis is why the FDA and CDC went ahead and authorized additional boosters without a ton of evidence suggesting the need to do so , Landon added .\nSome of the only evidence available on second boosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jab was authorized in early January for high-risk people \u2014 among adults aged 60 and older .\nA non-peer-reviewed study found that 0.1 % of people who got one booster died over the study \u2019 s 40-day period compared with 0.03 % of those who got two boosters .\nHow safe is it to participate in public activities months after receiving a booster ?\nAs mask mandates and other preventive measures disappear in many cities and states , and as your booster protection wanes , you may be wondering how safe it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors with others .\nTo be clear , what \u2019 s safe for you may not be safe for others .\nSo deciding how to reenter or continue navigating public life is highly dependent on your own risks , as well as how prevalent COVID is in your community , said Landon , who thinks now is a more appropriate time to live mask-free given low caseloads across the US .\n( The CDC offers a COVID tracker by county so you can check your local area . )\n\u201c There are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wearing masks in some situations , \u201d she said , but if you feel your risks are low , then consider the three C \u2019 s : closed spaces with poor ventilation , crowded areas , and close contact .\nIn general , wear medical-grade masks like N95s , Landon said , especially if sharing a space with unmasked or otherwise vulnerable people .\nAnd remember : There are several people who don \u2019 t respond properly to COVID vaccines or who aren \u2019 t yet eligible for vaccination , like babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we kind of owe it to them to be as careful as possible , \u201d Hatziioannou said .\nIf you \u2019 re particularly worried about getting infected , you may be tempted to take an antibody test to measure your protection .\nBut Landon said commercially available tests can \u2019 t tell you whether you have enough neutralizing antibodies ( those that can actually prevent infection ) .\nCould we reach a point where extra COVID boosters can \u2019 t offer more protection ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s definitely possible that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landon said , \u201c like we vaxxed out.\n\u201d But the mechanism behind this possibility isn \u2019 t well known .\nGrifoni of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology said scientists are trying to understand if we \u2019 ll reach a COVID vaccine limit , or if this virus will require annual shots like the flu .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very hard to say , \u201d she said , but we do already know that for other viruses , three doses seem to be the magic number for triggering a long-term immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , and hepatitis B vaccines .\nIn the meantime , Omicron BA.2 is circulating .\nIt \u2019 s too early to tell if it \u2019 s going to cause another devastating wave of infections and hospitalizations like in Europe , but it \u2019 s possible , Landon said , particularly in regions with lower vaccination rates .\n\u201c I certainly think anyone who wants to be protected should [ get a second booster if eligible ] and that individuals who have n't had any vaccines are at the absolute highest risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no evidence that COVID is getting easier or less dangerous , especially for people who are unvaccinated .\n\u201d",

Pramila Jayapal and Sen. Elizabeth Warren to committee chair Sen. Bob Menendez and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer were all publicly calling on Biden to cancel student debt .\nRep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend the freeze again rather than canceling student debt .\n\u201c I think some folks read these extensions as savvy politics , but I don \u2019 t think those folks understand the panic and disorder it causes people to get so close to these deadlines just to extend the uncertainty , \u201d she tweeted Tuesday .\nA coalition of eight other leading Democrats on the issue , including Warren , Schumer , and Jayapal commended Biden \u2019 s move in their own joint statement , calling the extension \u201c welcome.\n\u201d But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September deadline \u201c underscores the importance of swift executive action on meaningful student debt cancellation.\n\u201d Asked in March about Democratic calls for Biden to cancel student debt , a White House spokesperson highlighted the president \u2019 s past student loan repayment freezes .\n\u201c The President supports Congress providing $ 10,000 in debt relief .\nAnd he continues to look into what debt relief actions can be taken administratively , \u201d the spokesperson said .\n\u201c But all borrowers should do their part : take full advantage of the Department of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to lower payments or public service loan forgiveness , and get vaccinated and boosted.\n\u201d While Biden has repeatedly put the onus on Congress to pass legislation to cancel $ 10,000 in student debt per borrower , his administration already canceled more than $ 17 billion in student loans on its own , according to the Department of Education , including for borrowers who were misled by for-profit colleges .\nLast month , Biden \u2019 s administration announced that its earlier changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program would result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing the total number of borrowers whose loans were forgiven under Biden to 700,000 .\nStudent loan debt in the US totals nearly $ 1.8 trillion , the vast majority of which is federal .\nAs the cost of college has skyrocketed in the last four decades , wages for young people have not kept up .\nNearly 44 million people have federal student debt , according to the Education Data Initiative , and the burden of federal debt lies disproportionately on Black Americans \u2014 they are more likely to get federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $ 25,000 more in student debt than white graduates .\nWhile many Democrats support some form of student loan cancellation , Congress hasn \u2019 t made any significant moves on the issue since Biden took office .\nThe Senate is divided evenly by party , and Democratic Sens .\nJoe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema oppose changing Senate rules that would allow their party to pass major legislation with a simple majority .\nThat \u2019 s why Schumer and other Democrats have pushed Biden to go on his own .\nRepublicans initially backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the coronavirus pandemic , but the party has opposed Biden \u2019 s latest extensions .\nLast summer , the top Republicans on the House and Senate Education Committees wrote a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona saying that as more Americans got vaccinated another extension of the freeze would be \u201c unnecessary \u201d and too costly for taxpayers .",

are larger and more destructive than in the past and rising concern over health risks associated with indoor air pollution from sources like gas stoves , air quality seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before .\nOne potential solution for getting rid of contaminants in your home is an air purifier .\nBefore you start researching the best air purifier to buy , it \u2019 s important to understand what they can actually do and what you should be looking for depending on your particular space and risk factors .\nThe short answer is yes , but that doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re capable of clearing any and all pollutants or germs out of the air indoors .\n( Although air cleaners do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests . )\nA 2018 technical summary by the Environmental Protection Agency evaluated various studies to conclude that air cleaners operating in homes consistently reduce exposure to indoor particulate matter that is 2.5 to 10 microns in size .\nFor reference , the smallest particles visible to the human eye are generally in the 50- to 60-micron range ; a human hair is around 75 microns , pollen is 5 to 11 microns , dust is 0.5 to 3 microns , and tobacco smoke is around 1 micron or smaller .\nVery small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system because when you inhale them , they can travel deeper into the lungs than larger particles .\nEssentially , air purifiers can reduce particles floating around indoors , though the actual health benefits of that reduction may not be as substantial as you \u2019 d hope .\nThe EPA summary states that most studies have found a link between portable air cleaners in homes and at least one marker of improved health , although the improvements are typically modest .\nHow well an air purifier works also depends on proper use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the space , placed correctly ( not in some corner behind a curtain ) , has a certified filter that \u2019 s cleaned or changed as needed , and is run continuously with doors and windows closed .\n\u201c The amount of time that an air cleaner operates influences its ability to reduce pollutant concentrations and associated health risks , \u201d according to an EPA report .\n\u201c If they are not operating , they will not be effective.\n\u201d While adequate ventilation is also helpful in maintaining cleaner indoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make it more difficult for an air purifier to achieve the desired results .\nIn order to measure the actual efficacy of air purifiers , the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers ( a private voluntary standard-setting trade association ) developed the clean air delivery rate , or CADR , which is a measure of how much clean air a portable air purifier delivers measured in cubic feet per minute ( cfm ) .\nThe EPA says the CADR is the most helpful parameter for understanding the effectiveness of portable air cleaners .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d said Jill Notini , vice president of marketing and communications for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers ( AHAM ) .\n\u201c It looks at tobacco smoke , dust , and pollen , and the reason why is because those are three different particle sizes , so they 're good representatives for a small particle , a medium particle , and a larger particle.\n\u201d The higher the CADR number for each pollutant , the faster the unit filters the air .\nAs a general rule , AHAM advises that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equal to at least two-thirds of the room \u2019 s area .\nFor example , the AHAM website says that a room with the dimensions of 10 feet by 12 feet , or an area of 120 square feet , should have an air cleaner with a smoke CADR of at least 80 .\nAside from evaluating particle capture , their testing also looks at the fans and motors in these machines to see how much air they \u2019 re able to pull in and keep moving through the filters .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular pollutant and the device \u2019 s airflow rate .\nNotini said that pollen is one of the largest particles and smoke is one of the smallest , measuring in at 2.5 microns , aka a very fine particle that you can \u2019 t see but can easily inhale .\nShe also said that AHAM will be releasing a new standard for the removal of germs like fungi , bacteria , and viruses ( which people are looking for increasingly in the age of COVID ) .\nIt \u2019 s also working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its evaluations in the next few months .\nIn a 2020 study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health , researchers set up real and sham air purifiers in the homes of 32 healthy people and compared the air quality and volunteers \u2019 lung function during different four-week periods .\nThey found having an air purifier reduced the indoor 2.5 microns particulate matter level by about 11 % , but the result was only statistically significant in the homes of single people ( possibly due to fewer doors opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nThe air purifiers didn \u2019 t seem to improve lung function or reduce airway inflammation .\nIt \u2019 s possible air purifiers could be more helpful in homes of people with pets , smokers , higher-risk individuals , or those with a different model of air purifier , since effectiveness does vary from product to product .\nThis study may also have been too brief to detect an impact on health .\nThe CDC looked at data from multiple studies and concluded that portable air cleaners , particularly those with HEPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to air pollutants produced by wildfires and can potentially limit the negative health impacts from that exposure .\nDr. David Rosenstreich , the director of Allergy and Immunology at Montefiore Medical Center , explained that since dust is one of the larger particles , it tends to settle on surfaces , which makes it harder for an air purifier to suck in and capture .\nHe recommends air purifiers more often for people with pets or who have a mold issue , since animal dander and mold spores are the most common allergens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purifiers require some upkeep so that they continue to function as intended .\nStudies have shown that after an initial period of use and enthusiasm , the devices are often not maintained properly , operated less frequently , turned off completely , or put into storage because people are annoyed with the noise or other factors , according to the EPA .\nThat \u2019 s one good reason you should consider every possible feature when choosing an air purifier and try to find one that meets your needs .\nIf it ends up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be a waste of money .\nHow to choose the best air purifier The priority in selecting an air purifier should , of course , be its effectiveness in cleaning air .\nBut there are many different kinds of air purifiers with similar CADRs , so think about the other features that will encourage continued use .\nOne popular feature is a HEPA ( high-efficiency particulate air ) filter , which has deep pleats and a large surface area to help remove fine and ultrafine particles more efficiently .\nAir purifiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular and effective products on the market .\n( Rosenstreich recommends them exclusively . )\nHowever , they also have to be changed after 12 months or 8,760 hours of use .\nIf you tend to forget about things like changing filters , the alternative may be an air purifier with an electrostatic precipitator , which has a metal plate that charges particles so they become attracted to a plate with the opposite charge .\nSince the particles stick to the plate , you can simply remove it , clean it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying replacement filters , Notini said .\nSome of these types of air purifiers can produce low levels of ozone , which is a lung irritant , so they may not work for everyone .\nOther air cleaners use combined technologies to increase their filtration .\nThey may have activated carbon or charcoal filters to help remove gases and odors .\nThey can also have germ-killing features , like a UV light , to help reduce any bacteria or viruses that may get caught in the filters .\nIt \u2019 s also common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is generally a thicker flat or paneled filter that \u2019 s helpful in capturing larger particles , along with the main filter .\nThese filters need to be replaced more frequently , but some varieties are washable for repeated use .\nAfter deciding on a filtration system , experts agree that the most important consideration is the size .\nIf it \u2019 s more powerful than necessary for a small room , the sound may be too loud and intense ; if it \u2019 s too small , it won \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled with a CADR based on the size of the room they \u2019 re suitable for , so you should know the measurements of your space before shopping around .\nIt \u2019 s also important to note that the label will indicate the highest possible CADR , which typically occurs only at the highest ( and likely loudest ) airflow setting .\nIt will have a separate score for each pollutant measured ( dust , pollen , and tobacco smoke ) , which allows you to make sure it does the best job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about .\nYou can look out for the AHAM seal of approval , though there are other CADR evaluators , so just read the fine print to make sure it \u2019 s legit .\nOnce you \u2019 ve determined your room size and CADR requirements , you should think about noise level and aesthetics .\nSince it should be placed in a high traffic area to address the densest levels of contamination and odor , it probably shouldn \u2019 t be overwhelmingly noisy or unpleasant to look at .\nNotini said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sound and design to make air purifiers that are not only functional , but also quieter and aesthetically pleasing .\nNote what the labels or reviewers say about sound .\nSome products even have videos online so that you can hear exactly how loud they are at various settings .\nThe designs are more of a personal preference , but there is a very wide range of shapes , colors , and general vibes on the market .\nThese are some of the best options we \u2019 ve found , all things @ @",

        "content": "If chewing on a fried tarantula leg or biting into a crispy grasshopper makes you cringe , you could be missing out .\nMore than a quarter of the global population regularly munches on edible insects .\nAnts , beetles , and crickets are some of the nearly 2,100 bugs you can eat that not only are good for the planet because they take up fewer resources than meat production but also offer some serious health benefits you should know about .\nMany countries and cultures have eaten bugs for generations because they offer protein , healthy fats , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing the culinary and nutritious benefits of edible insects .\nCrickets especially are starting to grow in popularity in North America .\nThe quickly growing entomophagy ( or bug eating ) industry raked in more than $ 110 million in revenue in 2019 worldwide .\nGlobal Market Insights predicts the industry will grow by nearly 50 % by 2026 and be a $ 1.5 billion market .\nThe most commonly cited reason for eating bugs ( in populations that don \u2019 t normally consume them ) is that they are a more environmentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of animal-based products .\n\u201c Growing bugs would absolutely create a lesser impact on the environment than the meat industry , \u201d said Goggy Davidowitz , an entomology professor at the University of Arizona and head of edible insect research group HexaFeast .\nFor example , cattle generate 100 times more greenhouse gas than crickets for the same amount of protein and require more land and water in the process , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations .\nHowever , many species of bugs provide a nutritional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to try them out for that reason alone .\nCrickets in particular are one of the most-consumed insects across the globe .\nIn addition to protein , crickets contain healthy fats , zinc , iron , potassium , and fiber .\nThough any diet should contain a variety of nutritional foods , adding even a handful of grasshoppers or a scoop of cricket protein can support sustainable food systems while also filling in some of the gaps of a completely plant-based diet .\nThe nutritional value of edible crickets varies depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 60 species consumed in 49 countries around the world \u2014 as well as the stage of development , how they are prepared , what they are fed , and other factors .\nHowever , here is what you should know about their nutrients in general .\n( In this story , we based our cricket nutrition on an adult Acheta domesticus or Gryllus bimaculatus , which are both species many people eat . )\nIn general , insects can offer as much or more protein than beef , pork , or chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein in 3.5 ounces , or 100 grams , of edible crickets , which is about the same amount of protein in a small steak , pork chop , or chicken breast of the same weight .\nIf you \u2019 re thinking you would never swap a critter for a steak , know that edible insects come in powders , meatlike patties , chips , desserts , and other antennae-free options if the \u201c ick factor \u201d for you is strong .\nSome cricket species are also a complete protein , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amino acids you need in your diet .\nWhile animal-derived foods , like meat , eggs , and milk , and some plants , like quinoa and soy , are complete proteins , most plant-based foods have some amino acids but not others .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not easy to access complete proteins , so insects could play a good role for somebody who \u2019 s looking for an Earth-friendly diet , \u201d said Lisa Kilgour , a certified holistic nutritionist .\nNot everyone wants to eat a 100 % plant-based diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me at least a small source of easy-to-access proteins is a great thing.\n\u201d While exercise enthusiasts who make shakes or consume protein powder often turn to whey ( a milk protein ) , soy , or pea proteins , cricket protein powders offer a healthy alternative \u2014 they contain just as much protein as other powders but also offer fiber and vitamin B12 , which benefit your gut , brain , and nerve cell development and aren \u2019 t found as often in other types of powders .\n( However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by brand and type . )\nVitamin B12 is essential to health but only found naturally in animal-based products , like meat , cheese , eggs , and well , bugs .\n( Vegans typically need to make an extra effort to get vitamin B12 from supplements or fortified foods . )\nAbout 3.5 ounces of cricket flour has 24 micrograms of vitamin B12 , which is 10 times the recommended dietary allowance for adults .\nYou can find cricket protein powders online or at some Walmart stores .\nCrickets also contain healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatty acids in crickets are healthier polyunsaturated fat , although they do contain some saturated fat .\n\u201c There 's fatty acids as well as omega-3 and omega-6 that you might find in a cricket powder that you would n't with whey or a pea powder , \u201d said Keri Gans , a registered dietitian nutritionist and the author of The Small Change Diet .\nIn general , these types of fatty acids , which are also found in seafood , help maintain heart health and may help relieve anxiety and depression .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience allergic reactions to soy protein , that is unlikely to happen with cricket protein .\nHowever , those with shellfish allergies may have reactions to insects , so you may want to check with your doctor before trying a cricket-based protein powder .\nIt can be challenging for vegetarians , vegans , or those eating mostly plants to get enough iron .\nPlants contain the non-heme type , which is not as bioavailable as the heme iron found in animal products .\n\u201c An iron deficiency like anemia will cause fatigue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s not uncommon for someone whose diet is mostly plants to be anemic.\n\u201d You can get around 10\u201312 milligrams of non-heme iron per 3.5 ounces of crickets , which is more than the 8 milligrams recommended dietary allowance for iron for adult men and nearly the 18 milligrams RDA for most adult women .\nThis is more than twice the amount of iron found in a cup of spinach , which is the leafy green known for having a lot of the mineral .\nNon-heme iron is typically thought to not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use .\nHowever , a few studies have shown that iron from insects \u2014 including crickets \u2014 was absorbed at similar rates as iron from beef .\nThough fruits and vegetables are a great source of fiber , crickets can contain the same or more per serving .\nThe fiber in crickets comes from their tough exterior , made of a substance called chitin .\nIt \u2019 s an insoluble fiber , meaning it can \u2019 t be easily digested , so like the cellulose found in plants , it can support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk , and can help prevent constipation .\nA 2020 study found that some species of edible crickets can contain 13 grams of fiber in one cup .\nTypically , this is more fiber than other high-fiber foods like artichokes , which contains an average of 6.9 grams per cup .\n( Meat or animal products do not contain fiber . )\n\u201c Fiber in the diet is important , first and foremost , to help prevent constipation , \u201d Gans said .\nFiber can also help control your blood sugar , lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits .\nWhile you may think of a cold glass of milk when you \u2019 re looking for more calcium , you may start thinking about crickets instead .\nCrickets can have as much as 307 milligrams of calcium per cup , which is about the same as the amount of calcium in 1 cup of whole milk .\nWhile it varies by species of cricket ( some can have as little as 6 milligrams per cup ) , calcium is essential for growing and maintaining bones , muscles , and nerves .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ your potassium intake , a serving of crickets can contain as much potassium as several bananas .\nWith the crickets , you \u2019 d get around 28 to over 1,000 milligrams of potassium per 3.5 ounces ( depending on the species ) , compared with 375 milligrams in one banana .\nThis mineral helps sustain the fluid levels in your body \u2019 s cells and muscles , and getting an adequate intake can help keep your blood pressure under control .\nWhile nuts and seeds are a great source of zinc , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almonds to get the same amount of zinc as 1 cup of crickets .\nA cup of almonds can give you about 3 milligrams of zinc while crickets can offer more than 28 milligrams .\nZinc helps your cell growth and healing and supports a healthy immune system .\nEven if snacking on ants or crickets isn \u2019 t appealing to you , you might consider trying cricket protein powders or flours , which are already making their way onto grocery store shelves .\nEntrepreneurs are making delicious insect-infused foods like granola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers to eat .\nSince there are still not many cricket-based products available in stores , online shopping will be the best way to grab whole crickets or powders .\nJust know that bug-based products can be pricey ; they can range from $ 5 to $ 60 , depending on what you \u2019 re looking for .\nYou can find a variety of snacks , protein powders , and whole-roasted crickets at : \u2022 Entomo Farms has powders , snacks , and whole crickets \u2022 Chapul is a company that sells cricket-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has protein power in chocolate or vanilla \u2022 Ento Market has a number of edible insect-based snacks , candy , whole-roasted insects , and powders What do edible insects taste like ?\nWhile taste is highly personal \u2014 what tastes good to me may not appeal to you \u2014 many people say edible insects are worth trying and do taste good .\nMany bugs , like grasshoppers , are considered \u201c flavor vehicles \u201d because they take on the flavor of whatever you season or cook them with , similar to tofu .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutty or like mushrooms .\nOthers , like black ants , deliver a peppery taste that adds flavor to salads or soups .\nWith bug cuisine already picking up steam in North America , Davidowitz believes it \u2019 s only a matter of time before insects become an accepted part of the typical American diet .\n\u201c As long as it tastes good , people will get used to anything , \u201d Davidowitz said .\n\u201c People \u2019 s tastes will change.\n\u201d However , Gans thinks it might take a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get used to the idea of eating bugs .\n\u201c But if we take away the stigma

said .\nMelngailis told us her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are sucked into cults.\n\u201d Other people who have experienced manipulative relationships may identify more with Stockholm syndrome , in which

soulmate.\n\u201d Unfortunately , as the abuse gets worse and the affected person realizes what \u2019 s going on , it \u2019 s that much harder to escape .\n\u201c There is some kind of survival pressure when you want to agree with your gaslighter or when you get so exhausted from fighting for your integrity , for the rightness of your point of view , that you just begin to get depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very painful to know that you \u2019 ve given up a piece of yourself to hold on to this relationship ; it \u2019 s a process deserving of great

lucky.\n\u201d Part of the reason why leaving is easier said than done is because \u201c it takes a while for someone to fully understand what \u2019 s happening to them , especially at the hands of

        "content": "Tony Thorne was one of the officers on the Apollo project , advising the team on the task of merging large volumes of data .\nThorne , a former counterterrorism officer with the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit , said he was shocked by what he saw in Scotland .\n\u201c We left Scotland with a process that was not complete or adequate in any way , \u201d he said .\nThe key issues highlighted during the test run reemerged right away , according to emails and internal memos from 2014 and 2015 reviewed by BuzzFeed News .\nOfficers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routinely \u201d and \u201c timing out after 10 minutes , \u201d with glitches so severe that they dramatically increased \u201c the time required to perform a simple task.\n\u201d Even basic searches caused trouble .\nOne officer had described how he put in a search term and received a result that was too broad .\nHe started sifting through the documents manually to figure out which ones he actually needed \u2014 but as he did so , the system crashed .\nWhen he logged back in , he typed in the same search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result was not the same.\n\u201d Officers using the new systems also reported serious difficulties with the very problem the NCIA was aiming to solve : communicating with other forces and agencies .\nAfter a suspicious person entered the UK by plane , an officer reported that they received an important intelligence report from officers at the airport in an unreadable format .\nAnother told a member of the Apollo team that the NCIA \u2019 s inability to share intelligence with the other regions still using the old system was a critical risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d The quality of intelligence that did make it onto the system was often poor .\nIn some cases , the NCIA was deluged with irrelevant information ; in others , vital intelligence did not show up on the NCIA at all .\nOne officer complained that the system \u201c auto ingests \u201d documents that had nothing to do with terrorism .\n\u201c This issue was something that was always talked about , \u201d the officer wrote , \u201c however now we are live there appears to have been nothing more done about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the template of an already existing system called the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System ( HOLMES ) , four sources told BuzzFeed News .\nThe problem , one said , is that HOLMES is used to investigate incidents that have already occurred whereas the NCIA is intended to prevent attacks from happening .\nAnother officer told BuzzFeed News that building the NCIA on top of the HOLMES system caused defects that left large amounts of intelligence difficult to find .\nOfficers echoed these concerns in their emails and official reports .\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLMES system was a search tool , much like Google , that was supposed to enable officers to quickly retrieve documents containing a certain word , regardless of where on the record the particular word appeared .\nIf it worked , this would make it far easier to find specific intelligence on potential terrorists from hundreds of thousands of files .\nBut the search tool wasn \u2019 t working .\nOfficers found that if they put in the same search term on multiple occasions , they would often get a different result each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t able to scan for dates of birth , making it much harder to pinpoint the right document .\nThis shortcoming dovetailed with another major problem .\nEarly on , it became clear that many duplicated records would make their way onto the NCIA \u2014 since it was compiling data from multiple forces that often possessed the same file on a given individual .\nOne internal report seen by BuzzFeed News acknowledges that this would cause a \u201c knock on \u201d effect that hampered analysts .\nBut higher-ups ultimately decided that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire UK was using the NCIA .\nOne Manchester-based officer who later started using the NCIA told BuzzFeed News that duplications made finding what you were looking for like \u201c trying to find a needle in a haystack \u201d \u2014 such a struggle that \u201c you could miss vital intelligence leads.\n\u201d Thorne , the counterterror detective who worked on the NCIA , was growing increasingly concerned .\n\u201c Unfortunately , \u201d he wrote to colleagues in a February 2014 email , \u201c as we are all fully aware the NCIA has struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been fit for purpose.\n\u201d The rollout of the NCIA pressed ahead .",

        "content": "Instagram 's recommendation algorithms push pro-anorexia and disordered eating content to millions of users , including those whose bios identify them as under 13 years old , according to a new report by Fairplay , an advocacy organization focused on children \u2019 s digital wellness .\nThe report states that nearly 20 million Instagram users are \u201c fed content from Instagram \u2019 s Pro-Eating Disorder bubble , \u201d and that many of them are teenagers or younger .\nTo understand the reach of pro\u2013eating disorder content , researchers identified 153 \u201c seed accounts \u201d that were public , had over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disordered eating .\nThey calculated that approximately 1.6 million Instagram users followed one of these accounts , and 88,655 followed three or more .\nThe researchers found that almost 20 million Instagram users followed at least one of those 88,655 accounts , and might be prompted to follow the seed accounts because they had a mutual connection .\n\u201c One of the things I was struck by was how profoundly easy it was to identify this pro\u2013eating-disorder bubble , \u201d said Rys Farthing , data policy director at the advocacy group Reset Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farthing said that exposure to the content was primarily driven by Instagram \u2019 s suggestions about which users to follow .\nTest accounts that expressed an interest in weight loss or disordered eating were quickly flooded with recommendations from the platform to follow other users with these interests , including those that openly encourage disordered eating .\n\u201c All you would have to do is put some guardrails around that \u2018 follow recommendations \u2019 algorithm and you could burst that bubble , \u201d Farthing said .\nIn response to questions from BuzzFeed News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liza Crenshaw said in a statement : \u201c Reports like this often misunderstand that completely removing content related to peoples ' journeys with or recovery from eating disorders can exacerbate difficult moments and cut people off from community .\nExperts and safety organizations have told us it \u2019 s important to strike a balance and allow people to share their personal stories while removing any content that encourages or promotes eating disorders.\n\u201d Crenshaw said via email that when users search for or post about pro\u2013eating disorder content , the company highlights organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the option to specifically report content related to eating disorders .\nShe added that accounts sharing self-harm content will not be recommended and Instagram is working to restrict search results related to known self-harm hashtags or accounts .\nResearchers , journalists , and advocates have been raising alarms about disordered eating content on Instagram for years , culminating in fall 2021 when internal Facebook documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen showed that Instagram led teen girls to feel worse about their bodies .\nThis new report shows that Meta \u2019 s struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ongoing .\nBut Farthing and others hope change may be around the corner : US Sens .\nRichard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn recently introduced the Kids Online Safety Act , which would create a duty for platforms to \u201c act in the best interests of a minor \u201d using their services .\nThe California legislature is considering a similar provision , modeled after the UK \u2019 s Age Appropriate Design Code , that would require companies to consider children \u2019 s \u201c best interests \u201d when building or modifying their algorithms .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually hold tech companies to account , we could get some of this legislation through , \u201d Farthing said .\n\u201c And maybe when we have this conversation next year , I might actually have put myself out of business .\n\u201d",

Key West , Florida ; and Aruba in efforts to protect their marine ecosystems .\nOpting for a mineral sunscreen may also be a better way to protect your skin too , although there are some pros and cons .\nSince mineral sunscreens prevent some of the UV light from being absorbed into the skin , Kenkare said that it lowers long-term cumulative UV radiation damage , including the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can result in premature aging or wrinkles .\nThey can also help minimize pigment changes that you see in things like sunspots , post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation , scarring , or melasma , Kenkare said .\nMelasma is a condition caused by an overproduction of the cells that make the color of your skin , often resulting in brown or blue-gray patches .\nHeat can exacerbate the condition , according to Bordone .\n\u201c Chemical sunscreens convert UVB light to heat , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Physical sunscreens are better for people with melasma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than converting it to heat.\n\u201d In general , both doctors agree that mineral sunscreens tend to be less irritating for many people , especially those with sensitive skin .\nSome of the potential downsides of mineral sunscreen is that it may not last as long on the skin and wash off easily ( so you need to reapply more frequently ) and the texture , which can sometimes be thicker and harder to rub into your skin .\nAlso , mineral sunscreens , because they sit on top of the skin rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakouts or leave a white cast on your skin , though it \u2019 s cosmetic rather than a health problem .\nKenkare said that an early solution was to make them tinted , like the one that she uses every day as someone with brown skin who doesn \u2019 t want to \u201c look like a ghost.\n\u201d While there are some great tinted mineral sunscreens , not everyone wants the addition of color to their sunscreen .\n\u201c A more modern approach is to actually have micronized mineral particles , \u201d Kenkare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can blend a little bit better , so there are formulas of mineral sunscreen available now that can actually dry clear , and that 's ideal for somebody who 's not trying to look like a ghost.\n\u201d Kenkare also noted that the SPF for mineral sunscreens usually maxes out at 50 , which should be fine for the majority of people .\nShe said most people can get by with SPF 30 , but since the SPF on a sunscreen bottle is related to the amount of sunscreen applied , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d typically use .\nTherefore , choosing an SPF 50 may be safer if you are using a relatively thin layer .\nThe right mineral sunscreen for you may depend on your skin tone and how you \u2019 re using it , and there are now tons of great options on the market to keep your skin and the coral reefs safe .\nKeep in mind that just because a label says it \u2019 s reef-safe or non-toxic doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re completely chemical-free .\nMake sure to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something strictly mineral ( including all of the products below ) .\nIf you see it contains oxybenzone or octinoxate , it \u2019 s not a 100 % mineral sunscreen .",

\u2019 ll be the first to admit that menstrual cups carry a sort of stigma when it comes to managing your period that tampons and pads do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawbacks , including cost and sustainability , that menstrual cups could help avoid .\nAmericans use around 19 billion single-use menstrual products each year , and over 80 % end up in landfills where the plastic components can take up to 500 years to break down , according to the Life Cycle Initiative , a resource for information on global sustainability hosted by the UN Environment Program .\nWhen they \u2019 re disposed of incorrectly , such as being flushed down the toilet , they can block sewers , cause flooding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average person around $ 160 per year .\nSo why don \u2019 t more people use menstrual cups ?\nIt might be due to a lack of familiarity , concern about cleanliness and the need to wash them , or not knowing how to insert and remove them properly .\nThat \u2019 s where we come in .\nHere \u2019 s everything you need to know about menstrual cups as well as the best ones on the market if you \u2019 re thinking about making the switch .\nA menstrual cup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you insert into the vagina to collect period blood .\nThey come at a range of prices , with most falling in the $ 20 to $ 40 range , which would pay for enough tampons to get you through about three cycles or so ( less if you use both tampons and pads or pantyliners ) .\n\u201c I actually think [ using menstrual cups ] is a fantastic alternative when you think about how many tampons or pads a woman will go through in any given year , especially if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Wendie Trubow , an OB-GYN at a functional medicine and wellness company in Massachusetts .\nTrubow specifically recommended looking for one made from high-quality silicone , which would include most of the popular products on the market .\nShe also said that every vagina is a little bit different , and you want to honor that when selecting your cup .\nThat means choosing the right size and shape for your body , and paying attention to whether it \u2019 s intended for those who have or have not given birth .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup Trubow also noted that menstrual cups have a positive impact on the environment overall because you use fewer tampons and pads .\nWhat \u2019 s more , they can benefit septic systems , which can get clogged with cotton tampons .\nThere are other options that allow you to buy fewer tampons and pads , including reusable pads and period underwear , but menstrual cups are likely the sustainable winners with less than 1 % of the impacts of the single-use options over a year of use .\nBasically , after using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( what could equate to roughly 40 to 60 tampons ) , you would break even when it comes to your environmental footprint in terms of the resources it takes to produce menstrual products like tampons and pads .\nPeriod underwear and reusable pads still require significant water to launder , said Dr. Jennifer Lincoln , an Oregon-based obstetrician and author of Let 's Talk About Down There .\nShe agreed that menstrual cups are likely the most environmentally friendly period product on the market .\nDespite the fact that menstrual cups are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost-effective with a low frequency of adverse side effects as well as having similar or lower leakage as compared to disposable pads or tampons , findings from The Lancet Public Health indicated that awareness of menstrual cups is quite low , with only 30 % of websites intended for menstruation education including any information about them .\nHow to use a menstrual cup If you 're not sure how to insert a menstrual cup , the flexible silicone material allows you to fold the rim of the cup in order to place it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s rim then expands to take its original shape , with a large enough opening to catch any period fluid .\nYour specific cup should have instructions including how long it should last , the maximum time the manufacturer suggests keeping it in , and any other pertinent guidelines , Lincoln said .\nThey are considered to be very safe .\nSince they can hold more blood than other options , menstrual cups can be worn for up to 12 hours depending on your flow .\n\u201c I know it seems kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup in for 8 or 12 hours because we \u2019 re all taught with tampons , you have to take it out or you \u2019 re at risk for toxic shock syndrome , \u201d she said .\n\u201c When used as directed , they \u2019 re both extremely low risk for that.\n\u201d You can also keep using your cup until you start to notice any sort of cracking or material breakdown , unless otherwise noted .\nKeeping it clean is also important , so you may want to do a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can disinfect a menstrual cup by washing it with soap and hot water , soaking it in boiling water , or using a specified cleanser that many menstrual cup brands also sell . )\nThough it may seem obvious , Trubow also said you should absolutely not share your cup under any circumstances , and that it will not serve as birth control .\n( Athough some do say they can stay in during sex , they should still not be used to block sperm . )\nWhether you prefer a funnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom or the disc versions that you reach in and pinch to pull out , they should be fairly straightforward to remove .\nSince you \u2019 ll need to empty the cup and rinse it before reinserting , Trubow also advised being aware of your bathroom situation .\nIf you have to empty the cup in public , you should aim for private or single stalls if possible as opposed to a shared sink situation .\nIt might not be as messy as you think , particularly if you use it on days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy .\nBoth experts noted that menstrual cups are not recommended if you have an intrauterine device .\nThe removal process can create some suction , particularly with the funnel-shaped options , that may cause your IUD to dislodge .\nHowever , Lincoln said that if you have an IUD and still want to try a menstrual cup , you can have your doctor clip the IUD strings so that they \u2019 re flush with the cervix .\nYou could also use a disc-type cup since they \u2019 re less likely to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your doctor .\n( Menstrual cups are safe to use with contraceptive rings , although you have to be careful to not remove the ring when you are taking the cup out . )\nBecause menstrual cups are new for a lot of people , you should know that it may take some patience and effort to get the hang of using them .\nLincoln urges people to not give up too soon .\nShe suggested practicing the insertion when you \u2019 re not on your period so you can try one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water or a water-based lubricant can help insertion .\n( Don \u2019 t use silicone- or oil-based lubricants because they can damage the silicone material of a menstrual cup . )\nLincoln suggests talking to your healthcare provider if you \u2019 re having trouble so that they can walk you through the process .",

        "content": "The majority of people arrested in connection with Jan. 6 have been charged in separate cases .\nThe number of defendants is fast approaching 800 , and that figure is expected to keep going up \u2014 prosecutors have said in court that they believe more than 2,000 people went inside the Capitol , plus an as-of-yet unspecified number of people accused of assaulting police on the grounds or committing other crimes in restricted areas outside .\nProsecutors so far have opposed splitting up cases they \u2019 ve chosen to bring with two or more defendants .\nSome of these cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutors have pointed to shared evidence \u2014 like the photo outside the Capitol of the Sandovals , which prosecutors said they pulled from Deborah \u2019 s phone \u2014 and allegations that people traveled or moved around the Capitol together .\nThere are also cases where a group of defendants are charged with jointly assaulting police , even if there isn \u2019 t any indication that they knew each other or planned in advance .\nThere are typically two issues at play when a defendant asks a judge to sever their case : Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , and , even if they were , whether any prejudice to a defendant outweighs the government or the court \u2019 s interest in the efficiency of a joint trial .\nUnder federal court rules , the government can join defendants if they \u2019 re accused of participating \u201c in the same act or transaction , or in the same series of acts or transactions.\n\u201d Every defendant doesn \u2019 t have to be charged with the same counts .\nIn Jan. 6 cases , defendants who aren \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouped with those who are , or contend that being tried together undermines their ability to pursue certain defenses or get before a jury sooner .\nProsecutors have argued that the bar for splitting up defendants is high if the government can show that there are common allegations and evidence .\nThe fact that a defendant might have a better chance of acquittal if they go to trial alone isn \u2019 t enough , they say .\nIf any Jan. 6 defendant succeeds in getting their case severed , others with pending motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own judge \u2019 s attention , and it could inspire similar efforts in other multidefendant cases .\nOne judge \u2019 s decision isn \u2019 t binding on their colleagues .\nBut all of the judges in DC handling these cases have been watchful for how new issues play out across the bench .\nIn one of the conspiracy cases , Edward Badalian of California is pushing to separate his case from codefendant Daniel Joseph \u201c DJ \u201d Rodriguez .\nProsecutors allege the two men were in a Telegram group chat \u2014 along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gang \u201d that was used to discuss going to DC to disrupt Congress \u2019 certification of the election and coordinate travel plans .\nThe indictment charges them with going to the Capitol together on Jan. 6 and meeting up back in California afterward with a third , unnamed codefendant who broached the subject of deleting photos and videos of the group from the riot .\nBut Badalian argues the charges and evidence against Rodriguez are so much more serious that a joint trial would be unfair .\nRodriguez is separately charged with assaulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing a flagpole at officers , deploying a fire extinguisher , and tasing a police officer in the neck \u2014 and the indictment describes him making threats to assassinate President Joe Biden and harm members of Congress .\n\u201c Given the gravity of Rodriguez \u2019 s violence and threat to assassinate the President , and its shocking effect on any reasonable person , it is highly likely that the trier of fact will associate Rodriguez \u2019 s acts and his degree of culpability with Mr. Badalian , and that , as a consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Badalian is guilty , \u201d Badalian \u2019 s lawyer wrote in a March brief .\nProsecutors counter that the allegations of violence against Rodriguez are part of the overarching conspiracy that both men are charged with .\nThey argue the overlap in evidence leans in favor of a joint trial and that Badalian downplayed just how bad the evidence against him looks , too \u2014 that Badalian allegedly engaged in \u201c explosive \u201d rhetoric leading up to Jan. 6 and was part of the planning efforts and post-DC meetup .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jury would be able to \u201c compartmentalize \u201d that evidence , prosecutors said , noting that those alleged attacks were recorded on video and the two men weren \u2019 t dressed alike .\nThe judge has yet to rule .\nIn another conspiracy case , Alan Hostetter , a California man representing himself , is seeking to split his case from his five codefendants .\nHostetter argues that his defense strategy will be \u201c confrontational and oppositional \u201d to one of his codefendants , Russell Taylor , a former associate who Hostetter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort.\n\u201d ( Taylor hasn \u2019 t filed a response to Hostetter \u2019 s motion .\nThere \u2019 s been no indication in the case that Taylor was an informant ; prosecutors unsuccessfully argued to keep him in pretrial custody after he was arrested . )\nHe \u2019 s also claiming that he doesn \u2019 t know the rest of his codefendants and that the government \u2019 s references to their affiliation with the Three Percenters anti-government movement will prejudice his defense .\nProsecutors oppose Hostetter \u2019 s effort to spin off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegation that the defendants were all in the same Telegram chat group and coordinated plans to travel to DC .\nThey highlighted evidence that they said proves at least some of the defendants were together on Jan. 6 , including a photo that they said Hostetter took of three others .\nHostetter \u2019 s plan to argue that Taylor is an informant isn \u2019 t grounds to sever his case , prosecutors wrote .\nThe judge has yet to rule .\nRecently , in a conspiracy case against leaders of the Proud Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion by defendant Ethan Nordean \u2014 identified as a member of the Proud Boys \u201c Elders \u201d and a leader of his local chapter in Washington state \u2014 to sever two of his newest codefendants , Enrique Tarrio and Dominic Pezzola .\nNordean has been in jail in the year since he was first charged with conspiracy , and argued that pushing back deadlines in the case to accommodate Tarrio and Pezzola would run afoul of his constitutional right to a speedy trial .\nIn an April 12 order , US District Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of now , Nordean hadn \u2019 t shown that rescheduling the trial , which had been set for May , would violate his rights .\nKelly noted that the delay was intended not only to give Tarrio and Pezzola \u2019 s lawyers time to prepare , but also to make sure the government fulfilled all of its obligations to turn over evidence .\nAt a hearing last week , Kelly reset the trial for Aug. 8 .",

        "content": "Last year , BuzzFeed News started trying to learn about a company called BrightSpring Health Services , which owns more than 600 group homes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities .\nSpecifically , we were interested in what the conditions were like in those homes in the three years since KKR \u2014 a legendary private equity firm \u2014 bought the company .\nWe had heard stories , but we wanted facts .\nWe wanted data about the homes , what went on inside them , what kinds of inspections they \u2019 d had , and so on .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe federal government compiles a lot of data about nursing homes and puts it on a user-friendly website where families and researchers can examine it .\nBut when it comes to the kinds of group homes that BrightSpring runs , there is scant information , and it \u2019 s not available in a single database .\nSo we decided to build our own .\nThe first challenge was figuring out what homes BrightSpring owned .\nMany of its facilities operate under different names , such as ResCare , EduCare , Normal Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public records requests to state departments of health , then cross-checked the data gleaned from those requests against corporate filings in search of the relevant subsidiaries .\nWe examined BrightSpring \u2019 s intermediate care facilities ( ICFs ) , the type of group home with the most comprehensive state inspection reports .\nThese homes typically provide round-the-clock care for four to eight people .\nWe focused on the states with the most for-profit ICFs , according to federal records : California , Indiana , Louisiana , North Carolina , Ohio , Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we compiled a dataset of the owners of nearly 4,000 ICFs across those seven states .\nWe paired the information about which homes BrightSpring owned with data from state inspections , which are conducted to assess the quality and safety of the facilities .\nState inspectors typically visit ICFs at least once every 15 months ( or more often , if there is a complaint ) to check on everything from medication protocols to staffing levels to fire hazards .\nThe inspectors write detailed reports , describing conditions in the home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems were resolved .\nSome states make it very hard for the public to obtain these reports .\nLouisiana , for example , asked for thousands of dollars to provide copies , and Texas sent them to us with heavy redactions .\nBut if a facility is not meeting federal standards , an inspector can issue a citation , and data about those citations make their way out of the states and into the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , a federal agency , which makes them available online .\nOur analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , known as \u201c conditional \u201d deficiencies .\nBuzzFeed News \u2019 analysis found that , from when KKR took over BrightSpring in March 2019 through the end of 2021 , its homes were cited for dangerous conditions at a rate well above the average .\nIn the seven states we analyzed , KKR owns only 16 % of the homes but racked up 40 % of the serious citations \u2014 more than 500 in total .\nBefore publication , BuzzFeed News provided BrightSpring and KKR with a nine-page methodology explaining the analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We vehemently disagree with the grossly misleading narrative you presented.\n\u201d BrightSpring sent a similar statement calling BuzzFeed News \u2019 findings \u201c inaccurate , misleading , and fundamentally flawed.\n\u201d It said the data analysis was unsound because the underlying records were unreliable and were collected during a pandemic .\nBuzzFeed News consulted with four leading social scientists about the analysis methodology .\nThree of the experts \u2014 Alison Morantz ( Stanford University ) , George Garcia ( Stanford University ) , and Charlene Harrington ( University of California , San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA fourth , David Stevenson ( Vanderbilt University ) , has done similar analyses for nursing homes .\nAll of them said the federal data was a valid source to use for our analysis , that its limitations do not bias the results , and that our methodology was sound .\nTo review our full analysis , please see this GitHub repository .",

        "content": "Webster is the first Jan. 6 defendant to put a self-defense claim to a jury .\nOn the first day of trial , Monroe leaned into the narrative that the police officer involved , identified in court for the first time as Officer Noah Rathbun \u2014 he was referred to as \u201c N.R.\n\u201d in court papers \u2014 not only was to blame for the encounter , but also that he then failed to tell investigators about it afterwards , casting doubt on his credibility .\n\u201c This case is built on the lies of a young officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury .\nWebster is the sixth person charged in connection with Jan. 6 to go to trial and the fourth defendant to face a jury ; the other two cases were bench trials before a judge .\nIn the first three jury trials , the defendants were found guilty of all counts .\nJurors so far haven \u2019 t been swayed by defense theories that the government potentially fabricated evidence , in the case of Guy Reffitt , convicted of bringing a handgun to the Capitol ; that a defendant went inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the case of Thomas Robertson ; and that a defendant was following orders from former president Donald Trump , in the case of Dustin Thompson .\nA retired New York Police Department officer and veteran of the US Marine Corps , Webster faces a six-count indictment , including felony charges that he assaulted Rathbun with a weapon \u2014 a flagpole , in his case \u2014 that he was illegally in a restricted area with a weapon where a Secret Service protectee was present \u2014 former vice president Mike Pence \u2014 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil disorder .\nThe assault count is the most serious charge , carrying up to 20 years in prison , but the weapon element boosts the potential prison time of several other charges as well .\nAssistant US Attorney Hava Mirell , who delivered the government \u2019 s opening statement , agreed that the officer made contact with Webster \u2019 s face , but told the jury it was incidental and part of Rathbun \u2019 s effort to use his hand to create distance between Webster and himself .\nWebster isn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jan. 6 breach , but Mirrell drew a line between his alleged interference with police trying to hold back the mob outside with the disruption of the \u201c peaceful transfer of power \u201d that took place inside .\nShe referred to him at least twice as the \u201c rage-filled defendant \u201d and said the fact that he \u2019 d worn a bulletproof vest showed that \u201c he came ready for battle.\n\u201d After Webster knocked Rathbun to the ground , she said , he tried to remove the officer \u2019 s gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altercation the chin strap of the officer \u2019 s helmet was caught on his neck , choking him .\nThe self-defense narrative is one that US District Judge Amit Mehta expressed skepticism about last year .\nWebster had been kept in jail in the months following his arrest in February 2021 , and Mehta in June granted Webster \u2019 s request to go home pending trial .\nWebster \u2019 s lawyer raised the punch theory at the time , and Mehta said that after watching body camera footage , it appeared the officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster away .\n\u201c I see no evidence , none , that he was punched in the face , Mr. Webster .\nI do n't see it , \u201d Mehta said at the time , according to a transcript .\nMonroe \u2019 s opening presentation focused on his client \u2019 s record of military and law enforcement service , his lack of previous arrests , and the fact that Webster didn \u2019 t go into the building and wasn \u2019 t charged with any other violent acts or property destruction .\nHe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his house with him to Washington , and wore a bulletproof vest he \u2019 d been issued by the New York Police Department as protection .\nAs Webster came onto the Capitol grounds , he saw \u201c civilians \u201d who had been injured and made his way up to the front of the police line to find out what was going on , according to Monroe .\nHe suggested that Webster \u2019 s decision to swing the flagpole towards the officer and to push the officer to the ground was an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face \u2014 that he did those things to avoid being hit again .\nThe body camera footage recorded Webster yelling at officers as he came up to the front of the bike rack line : \u201c You fucking piece of shit .\nYou fucking commie motherfuckers man .\nGon na attack Americans ?\nNo fuck that .\n[ unintelligble ] Fucking commie fuck .\nCome on , take your shit off .\nTake your shit off .\nYou communist motherfuckers .\nFuck you.\n\u201d The jury heard from Jonathan Lauderdale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a task force investigating assaults on police at the Capitol on Jan. 6 .\nLauderdale said he \u2019 d been assigned to investigate a report that Rathbun filed about a hand injury he sustained from an assault inside the Capitol Rotunda , and saw the incident Webster was charged with when he went through Rathbun \u2019 s body camera footage ; Rathbun hadn \u2019 t filed an injury report related to that .\nLauderdale testified that when he spoke with Rathbun , the officer hadn \u2019 t initially remembered the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney Brian Kelly asked if it was surprising that an officer would n't remember an assault .\nLauderdale said it wasn \u2019 t .\nGiven all the footage he \u2019 d seen , he said , \u201c if I could forget that , I would.\n\u201d He later testified that a lot of officers had forgotten things that had happened because of the \u201c chaos.\n\u201d Lauderdale defended Rathbun \u2019 s handling of the situation , saying he gave the officer credit for showing \u201c restraint \u201d and not using any weapons against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagpole and retreating .\nLauderdale said that when he originally watched the body camera footage , he hadn \u2019 t seen the part where Rathbun made contact with Webster \u2019 s face ; it wouldn \u2019 t have changed his investigation , though , he said , since Webster was being aggressive and Rathbun had been using his hand to create distance .\nHe pushed back on Monroe \u2019 s suggestion during cross examination that Rathbun had violated the police department \u2019 s use of force policies .\nThe prosecutor attempted to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marine Corps , how the events of Jan. 6 and his work on the assault investigations made him feel as a police officer and veteran , but the judge upheld objections from Webster \u2019 s lawyer to that line of questions .\nThe government \u2019 s other witnesses on Tuesday included US Capitol Police officers and a US Secret Service official who offered more general testimony about the events of Jan. 6 , such as where the security perimeters were around the grounds , what Congress was doing that day as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2020 election , and how the Secret Service works with Capitol Police when a protectee like the vice president visits .\nUS Capitol Police Officer Joanna Berger , who was on the ground on Jan. 6 and was captured at one point in the body camera footage at issue in Webster \u2019 s case , described the situation as \u201c dangerous \u201d and \u201c scary \u201d as the mob breached the police line and there were threats all around them .\nShe said she \u2019 d been afraid to take off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because people in the crowd were throwing objects at police ; she was struck in the head with a wooden plank , she said .\nRathbun is expected to testify later in the week .\nIt took a day for Mehta to seat a jury for Webster \u2019 s trial .\nBefore the jury was brought in on Tuesday morning , he rebuffed a renewed challenge from Monroe to holding the trial in DC .\nDefense lawyers in some cases have argued that the Democrat-leaning makeup of city residents and their exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury pool against defendants in these cases .\nJudges so far have refused to move trials out of the city ; the bar generally is extremely high for judges to agree to transfer cases out of the jurisdiction where the alleged crime took place .\nMehta pointed out on Tuesday that not only was he able to seat a jury for Webster \u2019 s case , but that a relatively small proportion of potential jurors were immediately struck because they had some connection to the events of Jan. 6 or had expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case fairly because of their strong beliefs about what happened .\nNearly all prospective jurors screened to hear Jan. 6 cases so far have expressed at least some awareness of the attack on the Capitol , but described widely varying degrees of knowledge ; most said they had a generally negative opinion of what happened , but have often also said they could put those aside to judge whether an individual was guilty of committing specific crimes that day .\nThe prospective jurors who weren \u2019 t selected for Webster \u2019 s trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and witnessed violence ;

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A DC police officer took the stand Wednesday to describe his ultimately unsuccessful efforts to hold back the mob at the US Capitol on Jan. 6 , talking the jury through videos that showed him getting knocked over and struggling on the ground as a man tried to rip off his helmet and gas mask , choking him in the process , he said .\nOfficer Noah Rathbun , a member of the Metropolitan Police Department since 2015 , showed no emotion as he repeatedly watched videos depicting different angles of his physical altercation on the Capitol grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man charged with assaulting him .\nRathbun occasionally looked away from the screen and shifted in his seat , adjusting the bulletproof vest he wore as part of his uniform .\nRathbun denied claims by Webster \u2019 s lawyer , James Monroe , that he made a hand gesture inviting Webster to fight him and then punched Webster in the face , unprovoked except for verbal abuse .\nRathbun said his hand gestures , as captured on video , were meant to wave Webster back and create distance .\nThe officer agreed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point , but maintained it was open-handed and incidental to trying to push Webster back after Webster twice tried to shove the metal bike rack that Rathbun and other officers were trying to keep in place to stop the crowd of thousands from advancing closer to the Capitol .\nRathbun \u2019 s exchanges with Monroe were calm , even as Monroe suggested he \u2019 d withheld information about his contact with Webster from investigators , an accusation Rathbun denied .\nWebster \u2019 s defense against the six-count indictment hinges on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rathbun .\nWebster isn \u2019 t denying that videos and photos show him yelling obscenities at Rathbun and other officers , pushing against the bike racks , swinging a metal flagpole with a US Marine Corps flag attached at the officers , charging at Rathbun and knocking him down , and trying to remove the officer \u2019 s helmet and gas mask .\nBut Webster maintains that Rathbun instigated the confrontation and that he acted in self-defense ; his lawyer throughout two days of trial has consistently referred to the face contact as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury through his day on Jan. 6 .\nHe said he \u2019 d been stationed at the White House as part of a bicycle response unit on stand-by for an expected political demonstration ; supporters of former president Donald Trump gathered for a rally that morning near the Ellipse .\nAt around 1 p.m. , Rathbun said a radio call went out for assistance at the Capitol , and a riot was declared .\nWhen Rathbun arrived on the west side of the Capitol complex , he said the scene was \u201c very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chemical irritants in the air \u2014 and the crowd was \u201c hostile , \u201d cursing at him and other officers .\nThe local police officers made their way to the front of the building to join outnumbered US Capitol Police officers .\nRathbun said they were being \u201c pelted \u201d by objects .\nHe said he \u2019 d never faced a crowd that hostile before in his time on the force .\nHe recalled feeling \u201c overwhelmed \u201d and said it quickly became \u201c scary.\n\u201d Rathbun paused and looked at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness stand , which displayed a bird \u2019 s eye photograph of the crowd of thousands in front of the single line of police officers that he \u2019 d been part of after Assistant US Attorney Brian Kelly asked why the situation had become scary .\nThe officer explained how easily the crowd could have overcome the officers as the \u201c temperature \u201d of the situation was quickly rising .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t have any options , '' he said .\nNarrating a video recorded by his body camera , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike rack line and started yelling at him to \u201c take your shit off , \u201d he understood that to mean Webster wanted to fight him .\nHe said he tried to use his hands to create distance and push Webster away , and denied using a closed fist or punching him .\nHe said he was trying to physically push Webster back after the man had twice tried to push the bike racks , since there was nothing else to stop the crowd from going forward .\nWebster swung the flagpole towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the metal pole to separate .\nRathbun said he grabbed the pole from Webster and then retreated .\nHe said Webster charged at him and knocked him to the ground , and tried to pull off his helmet and his gas mask .\nRathbun said his helmet chin strap was caught on his neck and the bottom of his gas mask pressed into his throat , choking him .\nWhen the gas mask separated from his face , it let in irritants in the air , and when the mask snapped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making it hard to breathe .\nKelly asked what was going through his mind at that point .\nRathbun gave a wry laugh \u2014 one of the few times he smiled during his testimony \u2014 and replied , \u201c not good things.\n\u201d Rathbun was hospitalized later in the day , but not because of his confrontation with Webster .\nHe cut his hand trying to clear the crowd out of the Capitol Rotunda and had to get stitches , and filed an injury report related to that .\nKelly and Monroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t file a report about bruising on his legs that he said he \u2019 d sustained from the contact with Webster .\nRathbun said it didn \u2019 t seem like a reportable injury , and that being pushed to the ground didn \u2019 t feel like a meaningful incident given the other injuries officers suffered and the fact that several died .\nHe said he hadn \u2019 t reported bruises and minor cuts that he got on the job that hadn \u2019 t required medical treatment in the past .\nMonroe brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about use of force by officers , and had Rathbun explain that officers were supposed to \u201c defuse \u201d and de-escalate situations as much as possible before using force .\nRathbun agreed officers weren \u2019 t allowed to use force solely in response to verbal abuse from a civilian , and that punching someone in the face as a response to verbal abuse would violate the policy .\nBut he disputed that \u2019 s what happened at the Capitol .\nKelly asked Rathbun what he thought about the events of Jan. 6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s sad .\nYou know , this whole incident is tragic but I try not to think about it , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I just think it \u2019 s unfortunate to be in the nation \u2019 s capital and be treated like that by another citizen .\n\u201d",
